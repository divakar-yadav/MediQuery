    "description": "Background\n          Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are pivotal regulators of various human cancers and circ-ERBB2 is abnormally expressed in breast cancer cells. However, the role and mechanism of circ-ERBB2 in HER2-positive breast cancer are still unknown.\nMethods\n          The circ-ERBB2 expressions in the tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients were tested using quantitative real-time PCR. The circ-ERBB2 function was investigated by cell counting kit 8 assay, Transwell, flow cytometry and Western blot. Mechanistically, fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were conducted to confirm the interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p or miR-198 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells.\nResults\n      \n        Circ-ERBB2 is highly expressed in tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients and positively correlated with TFAP2C expression\n        To quantify the abnormal expressions of the six circRNAs (circ_0108942, circ_0001785, circ-ERBB2, circ-BMPR2, circ-UBE2D2, circ-IRAK3) in breast cancer tissues that are reported in previous literature, the qRT-PCR results authenticated that in comparison with the HER2 Negative group, circ-ERBB2 expression was elevated in the HER2 Positive group and circ-IRAK3 was decreased, and the other four circRNAs had no remarkable changes (Fig.\u00a01A\u2013F). Thus, circ-ERBB2 and circ-IRAK3 were chosen for our subsequent researches. Furthermore, the TFAP2C was increased in the HER2 Positive group compared with the HER2 Negative group. Meanwhile, in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, we discovered a positive correlation between circ-ERBB2 and TFAP2C expressions (Fig.\u00a01H). Thus, circ-ERBB2 was selected as the main circRNA in this research. Conclusively, our data expounded that circ-ERBB2 was increased in tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients and its expression was positively correlated with TFAP2C expression.Fig. 1Analysis of circ-ERBB2 expression in the tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients and its correlation with TFAP2C expression. HER2-positive (23 pairs) and HER2-negative (20 pairs) breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected. A\u2013F Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the expressions of circ_0108942, circ_0001785, circ-ERBB2, circ-BMPR2, circ-UBE2D2 and circ-IRAK3 (the abnormal expressions of them that have been reported in breast cancer tissues).

H Pearson correlation analysis of the correlation between circ-ERBB2 expression and TFAP2C expression in HER2-positive breast cancer tissues (r\u2009=\u20090.70, P\u2009<\u20090.01, n\u2009=\u200923), Pearson r correlation test. Data are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. Normal. &&&P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. HER2 Negative. ns: not significant\n      \n      \n        Interfering circ-ERBB2 restrains SKBR3 and BT-474 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and accelerates cell apoptosis\n        To investigate the circ-ERBB2 biological function on HER2-positive breast cancer, we firstly assessed the circ-ERBB2 expressions in HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-negative breast cancer cell lines. As expected, compared with the human breast\u00a0epithelial\u00a0cells\u00a0MCF10A, circ-ERBB2 expression was enhanced in the HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT-474 and was lessened in the HER2-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-468 and the HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT-474 were applied for the follow-up study (Fig.\u00a02A). After si-circ-ERBB2 #1, si-circ-ERBB2 #2 and si-circ-ERBB2 #3 were separately transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, the transfection efficiency was presented in Fig.\u00a02B, C. The si-circ-ERBB2 #2 had the best interference effect, so it was selected for our research. Subsequently, CCK-8 analysis expounded that the decreased circ-ERBB2 repressed the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a02D, E). Similarly, the Transwell results corroborated that the interference with circ-ERBB2 suppressed\u00a0the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell migration and invasion (Fig.\u00a02F\u2013I). Meanwhile, the loss of circ-ERBB2 accelerated the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell apoptosis (Fig.\u00a02J). Based on these findings, the protein levels of TFAP2C, HER2 and the downstream signaling pathway proteins Akt, p-Akt, ERK and p-ERK were further assessed. As displayed in Fig.\u00a02K, L, the interference with circ-ERBB2 lessened the TFAP2C, HER2, p-Akt and p-ERK protein levels. The expression of HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells was determined\u00a0using Western blot (Fig.\u00a02K). Moreover, the HER2 expression was further verified in HER2-positive breast cancer cells by flow cytometry (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). In general, the interference with circ-ERBB2 repressed HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and accelerated cell apoptosis.Fig. 2Effect of circ-ERBB2 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. A Detection of circ-ERBB2 levels in human breast\u00a0epithelial\u00a0cells\u00a0MCF10A, HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT-474 and HER2-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and\u00a0MDA-MB-468, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc. B, C si-circ-ERBB2 #1, si-circ-ERBB2 #2 and si-circ-ERBB2 #3 were separately transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc. The transfection efficiency of si-circ-ERBB2 was assessed by qRT-PCR. D, E si-circ-ERBB2 #2 was transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was applied to analyze the proliferation of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, two-way ANOVA for group comparison, multiple t-test to compare the same time between two groups. F\u2013I The cell migration and invasion were measured by Transwell assay (scale bar\u2009=\u2009200\u00a0\u03bcm), G, I or J unpaired two-tailed t-test. J Flow cytometry was conducted to detect the apoptosis of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, values are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments. K, L The protein levels of TFAP2C, HER2 and the downstream signaling pathway proteins Akt, p-Akt, ERK and p-ERK were measured by Western blot analysis. Data are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090. 01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. si-NC. ***P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. MCF10A. NC: negative control\n      \n      \n        Verification of interactions between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p, circ-ERBB2 and miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells\n        Based on our confirmation of the circ-ERBB2 critical function in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, we continue to investigate whether circ-ERBB2 functioned in cells by miRNA adsorption through a ceRNA mechanism. Firstly, the circ-ERBB2 localization in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells was assessed and the results demonstrated that circ-ERBB2 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, hinting that circ-ERBB2 might function as a \"sponge\" for miRNAs in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a03A). The binding of circ-ERBB2 to Ago2 was verified by RIP and the results clarified that Ago2 antibody enriched circ-ERBB2, implying that circ-ERBB2 was incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (Fig.\u00a03B). Meanwhile, we used the specific probe of circ-ERBB2 for RNA pull-down assay to verify the miRNAs (miR-136-5p, miR-564, miR-198, miR-892b, miR-890 and miR-377-3p) that have been reported in breast cancer and might be regulated by circ-ERBB2. As presented in Fig.\u00a03C, D, in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 were enriched in the pull-down complex of circ-ERBB2. Hence, miR-136-5p and miR-198 were chosen as the main miRNAs. As expected, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the luciferase activity of circ-ERBB2 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells (Fig.\u00a03E\u2013H). Meanwhile, miR-136-5p and miR-198 were lowly expressed in the HER2-positive breast cancer cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). In summary, circ-ERBB2 interacted with miR-136-5p or miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells.Fig. 3Interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p, circ-ERBB2 and miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. A Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to analyze the localization of circ-ERBB2 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells (scale bar\u2009=\u200910\u00a0\u03bcm). B The binding of circ-ERBB2 to Ago2 was verified by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), unpaired two-tailed t-test. C, D RNA pull-down assay was conducted to investigate the interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p, miR-564, miR-198, miR-892b, miR-890 and miR-377-3p (all of them are reported in breast cancer and might be regulated by circ-ERBB2), unpaired two-tailed t-test. E Online bioinformatics software (Circular RNA interactome) analysis revealed that there were binding sites between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p. F The interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, unpaired two-tailed t-test. G Online bioinformatics software (Circular RNA interactome) analysis predicted that there were binding sites between circ-ERBB2 and miR-198. H Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to verify the interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-198, unpaired two-tailed t-test. **P\u2009<\u20090.01 vs. mimic NC.

As displayed in Fig.\u00a04A, B, in comparison with the Normal group, miR-136-5p and miR-198 were lowly expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer tissues. In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the miR-136-5p or miR-198 was both negatively correlated with the TFAP2C expression (Fig.\u00a04C, D). Furthermore, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the luciferase activity of TFAP2C (Fig.\u00a04E\u2013H). After the transfection of miR-136-5p mimic, miR-136-5p inhibitor, miR-198 mimic or miR-198 inhibitor into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, the transfection efficiency data were presented in Fig.\u00a04I\u2013L. Furthermore, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the TFAP2C protein level (Fig.\u00a04I\u2013L). In general, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 targeted TFAP2C and negatively regulated its protein level.Fig. 4The targeted regulation of TFAP2C by miR-136-5p and miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells.

E The binding sites between miR-136-5p and TFAP2C were predicted by online bioinformatics software (RNAInter). F Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to prove the interaction between miR-136-5p and TFAP2C, unpaired two-tailed t-test.

I\u2013L miR-136-5p mimic, miR-136-5p inhibitor, miR-198 mimic or miR-198 inhibitor was transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. The transfection efficiency was verified by qRT-PCR and the protein level of TFAP2C was quantified by Western blot, unpaired two-tailed t-test.

As displayed in Fig.\u00a05A, B, the interference with circ-ERBB2 restrained the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell proliferation, while this restraint was reversed by the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown. Similarly, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown weakened the invasion and migration abilities of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, and the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown reversed this trend (Fig.\u00a05C\u2013F). In contrast, the interference with circ-ERBB2 accelerated the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell apoptosis, while this trend was reversed by the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05G, H). Meanwhile, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown lessened the TFAP2C, HER2, p-Akt and p-ERK protein levels, and the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown counteracted the impacts of circ-ERBB2 down-regulation on these protein levels (Fig.\u00a05I). Collectively, circ-ERBB2 might function as a ceRNA for miR-136-5p or miR-198 to positively regulate the TFAP2C protein level, thus influencing the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell function.Fig. 5Circ-ERBB2 influenced the proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells through the circ-ERBB2/miR-136-5p/TFAP2C axis or the\u00a0circ-ERBB2/miR-198/TFAP2C axis. si-circ-ERBB2 and/or miR-136-5p inhibitor, si-circ-ERBB2 and/or miR-198 inhibitor were separately transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells.

In comparison with the Lenti-sh-NC group, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown reduced the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013C). The interference efficiency of circ-ERBB2 was verified using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a06D). Moreover, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown elevated both miR-136-5p and miR-198 expressions (Fig.\u00a06E, F). Furthermore, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown led to a decrease of metastasis nodes in the lung and heart of mice (Fig.\u00a06H). Meanwhile, in comparison with the Lenti-sh-NC group, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown lessened the HER2, p-Akt and p-ERK protein levels. To sum up, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown repressed the tumor growth in vivo.Fig. 6Influence of circ-ERBB2 on tumor growth in vivo.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a proto-oncogene [2] and is overexpressed in nearly 20% of breast cancer patients, which leads to high recurrence rates and poor prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer [3]. Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanism of the elevated HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer is momentous to ameliorate HER2-positive breast cancer .\n      Circular RNAs (circRNAs)\u00a0are tissue-specific and conserved endogenous non-coding RNAs that are enriched in mammalian cells [4, 5]. Due to the specificity of circRNAs under different pathological states, they are usually chosen as biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. For instance, Yang et al. corroborated that circAGFG1 is elevated and its expression is interrelated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer patients [6]; Qu et al. demonstrated that silencing circRNA-CER in breast cancer cells restrains cell proliferation and migration, hinting that circRNA-CER might be an underlying biomarker for breast cancer prediction [7]. However, there are few studies on the circRNAs functions in HER2-positive breast cancer.\n      Circ-ERBB2, also named hsa_circ_0043459, has attracted our attention due to its function in tumor regulation. In gastric cancer, the elevated circ-ERBB2 enhances tumor growth and reduces overall survival in patients, and circ-ERBB2 exerts a carcinogenic effect in gastric cancer cells [8]; in lung cancer, propofol therapy represses the lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion via lessening circ-ERBB2, which provides a novel target for lung cancer treatment [9]. In the current research, we searched through the circBase database (http://www.circbase.org/) and discovered that circ-ERBB2 was expressed in human breast cancer cells MCF7. Crucially, a previous study also expounds that circ-ERBB2 is abnormally expressed in breast cancer cells [10]. What similar to this finding, our studies authenticated that circ-ERBB2 was highly expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer tissues and we further corroborated that the interference with circ-ERBB2 repressed HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and accelerated cell apoptosis.\n      Increasing evidence confirms that circRNAs act as miRNA sponges to participate in breast cancer development. Wu et al. corroborated that circIRAK3 sponges miR-3607 to accelerate breast cancer metastasis [11]; Liang et al. authenticated that circKDM4C is identified as a sponge for miR-548p and restrains breast cancer progression and attenuates doxorubicin resistance of breast cancer [12]. Importantly, we previously confirmed circ-ERBB2 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of HER2-positive breast cancer cells through fluorescence in situ hybridization, implying that circ-ERBB2 might function as the miRNAs sponge in HER2-positive breast cancer. Previous researches clarified that miR-136-5p, miR-564, miR-198, miR-892b, miR-890 and miR-377-3p are abnormally expressed in breast cancer [13\u201318]. Thus, these six miRNAs were chosen as the main miRNAs targeted by circ-ERBB2 in HER2-positive breast cancer in this research. Transcription factor activator protein 2C (TFAP2C), also known as AP-2\u03b3, mediates the breast cancer occurrence and is a promising marker for predicting the prognosis of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [19]. Meanwhile, the online bioinformatics software analysis displayed that TFAP2C might be the downstream target for miR-136-5p or miR-198 (among the above six miRNAs). Therefore, TFAP2C became one of the key molecules in this study.\n      In this research, we identified the abnormally elevated circ-ERBB2 in HER2-positive breast cancer and authenticated that the interference with circ-ERBB2 repressed tumor cell growth. Combined with the discovery that circ-ERBB2 was localized in the cytoplasm, we continued to investigate whether circ-ERBB2 exerted a regulatory function in HER2-positive breast cancer through the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism.\nMaterials and methods\n      \n        Clinical samples\n        All clinical samples were gathered from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. A total of 23 HER2-positive breast cancer tissues and 20 HER2-negative breast cancer tissues and the paired adjacent normal tissues were included in the current study.

A microscope (Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory, Shanghai, China) was applied for photography and observation.\nStatistical analysis\n        All data were assessed by GraphPad Prism 5.0 and were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Differences between groups were evaluated using Student\u2019s\u00a0t-test or one-way ANOVA test unless otherwise specified. Differences between groups were considered significant when the P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nCirc-ERBB2 is highly expressed in tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients and positively correlated with TFAP2C expression\n        To quantify the abnormal expressions of the six circRNAs (circ_0108942, circ_0001785, circ-ERBB2, circ-BMPR2, circ-UBE2D2, circ-IRAK3) in breast cancer tissues that are reported in previous literature, the qRT-PCR results authenticated that in comparison with the HER2 Negative group, circ-ERBB2 expression was elevated in the HER2 Positive group and circ-IRAK3 was decreased, and the other four circRNAs had no remarkable changes (Fig.\u00a01A\u2013F). Thus, circ-ERBB2 and circ-IRAK3 were chosen for our subsequent researches. Furthermore, the TFAP2C was increased in the HER2 Positive group compared with the HER2 Negative group. Meanwhile, in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, we discovered a positive correlation between circ-ERBB2 and TFAP2C expressions (Fig.\u00a01H). Thus, circ-ERBB2 was selected as the main circRNA in this research. Conclusively, our data expounded that circ-ERBB2 was increased in tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients and its expression was positively correlated with TFAP2C expression.Fig. 1Analysis of circ-ERBB2 expression in the tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients and its correlation with TFAP2C expression. HER2-positive (23 pairs) and HER2-negative (20 pairs) breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected. A\u2013F Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the expressions of circ_0108942, circ_0001785, circ-ERBB2, circ-BMPR2, circ-UBE2D2 and circ-IRAK3 (the abnormal expressions of them that have been reported in breast cancer tissues).

As expected, compared with the human breast\u00a0epithelial\u00a0cells\u00a0MCF10A, circ-ERBB2 expression was enhanced in the HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT-474 and was lessened in the HER2-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-468 and the HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT-474 were applied for the follow-up study (Fig.\u00a02A). After si-circ-ERBB2 #1, si-circ-ERBB2 #2 and si-circ-ERBB2 #3 were separately transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, the transfection efficiency was presented in Fig.\u00a02B, C. The si-circ-ERBB2 #2 had the best interference effect, so it was selected for our research. Subsequently, CCK-8 analysis expounded that the decreased circ-ERBB2 repressed the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a02D, E). Similarly, the Transwell results corroborated that the interference with circ-ERBB2 suppressed\u00a0the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell migration and invasion (Fig.\u00a02F\u2013I). Meanwhile, the loss of circ-ERBB2 accelerated the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell apoptosis (Fig.\u00a02J). Based on these findings, the protein levels of TFAP2C, HER2 and the downstream signaling pathway proteins Akt, p-Akt, ERK and p-ERK were further assessed. As displayed in Fig.\u00a02K, L, the interference with circ-ERBB2 lessened the TFAP2C, HER2, p-Akt and p-ERK protein levels. The expression of HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells was determined\u00a0using Western blot (Fig.\u00a02K). Moreover, the HER2 expression was further verified in HER2-positive breast cancer cells by flow cytometry (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). In general, the interference with circ-ERBB2 repressed HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and accelerated cell apoptosis.Fig. 2Effect of circ-ERBB2 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. A Detection of circ-ERBB2 levels in human breast\u00a0epithelial\u00a0cells\u00a0MCF10A, HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT-474 and HER2-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and\u00a0MDA-MB-468, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc. B, C si-circ-ERBB2 #1, si-circ-ERBB2 #2 and si-circ-ERBB2 #3 were separately transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc. The transfection efficiency of si-circ-ERBB2 was assessed by qRT-PCR. D, E si-circ-ERBB2 #2 was transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was applied to analyze the proliferation of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, two-way ANOVA for group comparison, multiple t-test to compare the same time between two groups. F\u2013I The cell migration and invasion were measured by Transwell assay (scale bar\u2009=\u2009200\u00a0\u03bcm), G, I or J unpaired two-tailed t-test.

K, L The protein levels of TFAP2C, HER2 and the downstream signaling pathway proteins Akt, p-Akt, ERK and p-ERK were measured by Western blot analysis. Data are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090. 01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. si-NC. ***P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. MCF10A. NC: negative control\nVerification of interactions between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p, circ-ERBB2 and miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells\n        Based on our confirmation of the circ-ERBB2 critical function in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, we continue to investigate whether circ-ERBB2 functioned in cells by miRNA adsorption through a ceRNA mechanism. Firstly, the circ-ERBB2 localization in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells was assessed and the results demonstrated that circ-ERBB2 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, hinting that circ-ERBB2 might function as a \"sponge\" for miRNAs in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a03A). The binding of circ-ERBB2 to Ago2 was verified by RIP and the results clarified that Ago2 antibody enriched circ-ERBB2, implying that circ-ERBB2 was incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (Fig.\u00a03B). Meanwhile, we used the specific probe of circ-ERBB2 for RNA pull-down assay to verify the miRNAs (miR-136-5p, miR-564, miR-198, miR-892b, miR-890 and miR-377-3p) that have been reported in breast cancer and might be regulated by circ-ERBB2. As presented in Fig.\u00a03C, D, in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 were enriched in the pull-down complex of circ-ERBB2. Hence, miR-136-5p and miR-198 were chosen as the main miRNAs. As expected, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the luciferase activity of circ-ERBB2 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells (Fig.\u00a03E\u2013H). Meanwhile, miR-136-5p and miR-198 were lowly expressed in the HER2-positive breast cancer cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). In summary, circ-ERBB2 interacted with miR-136-5p or miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells.Fig. 3Interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p, circ-ERBB2 and miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. A Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to analyze the localization of circ-ERBB2 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells (scale bar\u2009=\u200910\u00a0\u03bcm). B The binding of circ-ERBB2 to Ago2 was verified by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), unpaired two-tailed t-test. C, D RNA pull-down assay was conducted to investigate the interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p, miR-564, miR-198, miR-892b, miR-890 and miR-377-3p (all of them are reported in breast cancer and might be regulated by circ-ERBB2), unpaired two-tailed t-test. E Online bioinformatics software (Circular RNA interactome) analysis revealed that there were binding sites between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p. F The interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-136-5p was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, unpaired two-tailed t-test. G Online bioinformatics software (Circular RNA interactome) analysis predicted that there were binding sites between circ-ERBB2 and miR-198. H Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to verify the interaction between circ-ERBB2 and miR-198, unpaired two-tailed t-test. **P\u2009<\u20090.01 vs. mimic NC.

As displayed in Fig.\u00a04A, B, in comparison with the Normal group, miR-136-5p and miR-198 were lowly expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer tissues. In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the miR-136-5p or miR-198 was both negatively correlated with the TFAP2C expression (Fig.\u00a04C, D). Furthermore, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the luciferase activity of TFAP2C (Fig.\u00a04E\u2013H). After the transfection of miR-136-5p mimic, miR-136-5p inhibitor, miR-198 mimic or miR-198 inhibitor into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, the transfection efficiency data were presented in Fig.\u00a04I\u2013L. Furthermore, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the TFAP2C protein level (Fig.\u00a04I\u2013L). In general, both miR-136-5p and miR-198 targeted TFAP2C and negatively regulated its protein level.Fig. 4The targeted regulation of TFAP2C by miR-136-5p and miR-198 in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells.

As displayed in Fig.\u00a05A, B, the interference with circ-ERBB2 restrained the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell proliferation, while this restraint was reversed by the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown. Similarly, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown weakened the invasion and migration abilities of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, and the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown reversed this trend (Fig.\u00a05C\u2013F). In contrast, the interference with circ-ERBB2 accelerated the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell apoptosis, while this trend was reversed by the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05G, H). Meanwhile, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown lessened the TFAP2C, HER2, p-Akt and p-ERK protein levels, and the miR-136-5p knockdown or miR-198 knockdown counteracted the impacts of circ-ERBB2 down-regulation on these protein levels (Fig.\u00a05I). Collectively, circ-ERBB2 might function as a ceRNA for miR-136-5p or miR-198 to positively regulate the TFAP2C protein level, thus influencing the SKBR3 and BT-474 cell function.Fig. 5Circ-ERBB2 influenced the proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of SKBR3 and BT-474 cells through the circ-ERBB2/miR-136-5p/TFAP2C axis or the\u00a0circ-ERBB2/miR-198/TFAP2C axis. si-circ-ERBB2 and/or miR-136-5p inhibitor, si-circ-ERBB2 and/or miR-198 inhibitor were separately transfected into SKBR3 and BT-474 cells.

In comparison with the Lenti-sh-NC group, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown reduced the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013C). The interference efficiency of circ-ERBB2 was verified using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a06D). Moreover, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown elevated both miR-136-5p and miR-198 expressions (Fig.\u00a06E, F). Furthermore, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown led to a decrease of metastasis nodes in the lung and heart of mice (Fig.\u00a06H). Meanwhile, in comparison with the Lenti-sh-NC group, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown lessened the HER2, p-Akt and p-ERK protein levels. To sum up, the circ-ERBB2 knockdown repressed the tumor growth in vivo.Fig. 6Influence of circ-ERBB2 on tumor growth in vivo.

So far, some circRNAs have been identified as the biomarkers for breast cancer [23\u201325]. However, there are few reports about circRNAs in HER2-positive breast cancer. Here, we assessed the expressions of six circRNAs that have been reported to be abnormally expressed in breast cancer: circ_0108942, circ_0001785, circ-ERBB2, circ-BMPR2, circ-UBE2D2, circ-IRAK3 [10, 11, 26\u201328]. Through the preliminary screening of qRT-PCR, we focused on a novel circRNA: circ-ERBB2, which was abnormally high expressed in tumor tissues of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and was interrelated to Lymph node metastasis and HER2 status in patients. Functionally, circ-ERBB2 knockdown restrained HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and accelerated cell apoptosis. Mechanically, circ-ERBB2 positively regulated TFAP2C expression through sponging miR-136-5p or miR-198, thereby regulating HER2-positive breast cancer cell function. Generally, our data corroborated that circ-ERBB2 might act as an oncogene in HER2-positive breast cancer development and provide two novel regulatory axes for HER2-positive breast cancer: circ-ERBB2/miR-136-5p/TFAP2C and circ-ERBB2/miR-198/TFAP2C.\n      The ceRNA hypothesis suggests that non-coding RNA transcripts regulate target gene expression by competing for the same miRNA response element (MRE) [29, 30]. Accumulated evidence demonstrates that circRNAs act as miRNA sponges to regulate miRNA target gene expression in breast cancer. For instance, circ_100876 accelerates breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through sponging miR-361-3p [31]; circKIF4A functions as a ceRNA to accelerate the KIF4A expression by sponging miR-375, thus aggravating breast cancer [32]. In the present study, the FISH assay corroborated that circ-ERBB2 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of HER2-positive breast cancer cells, prompting that circ-ERBB2 might function as a miRNAs \"sponge\" in the cytoplasm. Critically, previous researches authenticate that miR-136-5p, miR-564, miR-198, miR-892b, miR-890 and miR-377-3p are abnormally expressed in breast cancer [13\u201318]. To further investigate whether circ-ERBB2 in HER2-positive breast cancer affected the cell growth and metastasis through one or more of the target miRNAs, we screened and validated the above six miRNAs. As expected, RIP, RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed the binding of circ-ERBB2 to miR-136-5p or miR-198 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Thus, we supposed that circ-ERBB2 might exert its oncogenic function in HER2-positive breast cancer by sponging miR-136-5p or miR-198.\n      TFAP2C is a member of the AP2 transcription factor family and has pivotal regulation in cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis [33]. TFAP2C is initially confirmed to function in embryonic development [34]. With the continuous research on the TFAP2C function, increasing evidence expounds that TFAP2C mediates breast cancer progression. For instance, Turner et al. confirmed that TFAP2C is highly expressed in human breast cancer and TFAP2C controls the breast cancer cell growth and differentiation [35]. Critically, Wu et al. demonstrated that TFAP2C drives the HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion and predicts the prognosis in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [19]. In the present study, online bioinformatics software analysis displayed that TFAP2C might be the downstream target for miR-136-5p or miR-198 and this hypothesis was further confirmed using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Meanwhile, our in-depth study clarified that both miR-136-5p and miR-198 negatively regulated the TFAP2C expression in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer cell lines, which was similar to the previous conclusions [36, 37]. Based on the above findings, we further demonstrated that the interference with circ-ERBB2 repressed HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and accelerated cell apoptosis via the\u00a0miR-136-5p/TFAP2C axis or the\u00a0miR-198/TFAP2C axis through the rescue assays. Accumulated evidence expounds that the\u00a0Akt and ERK signaling pathways are interrelated to breast cancer progression and are regulated by circRNAs [38, 39]. Here, our study preliminarily corroborated that the circ-ERBB2 knockdown inactivated the Akt and ERK signaling pathways via the miR-136-5p/TFAP2C axis or the\u00a0miR-198/TFAP2C axis. Moreover, in vivo assays further expounded that the circ-ERBB2 knockdown restrained the HER2-positive breast cancer growth and metastasis.\n      In conclusion, our results demonstrated that circ-ERBB2 was highly expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer and was interrelated to Lymph node metastasis and HER2 status in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and the circ-ERBB2 knockdown repressed HER2-positive breast cancer cell growth, preliminarily confirming that circ-ERBB2 might be a novel oncogene in HER2-positive breast cancer and we further provided novel ceRNA regulatory pathways for HER2-positive breast cancer: circ-ERBB2/miR-136-5p/TFAP2C or circ-ERBB2/miR-198/TFAP2C. Our research might bring promising and valuable biomarkers for HER2-positive breast cancer treatment.",
