    "description": "Problem\n        Brain metastasis is an unmet clinical need that currently affects up to 25% of cancer patients. A major issue remains the lack of knowledge on the vulnerabilities that, if properly exploited, could generate therapeutic opportunities.\nResult\n        We report a novel drug\u2010screening platform to study vulnerabilities of metastasis during their growth in the organ being colonized. This platform, based on organotypic cultures, effectively identified compounds that were later validated in\u00a0vivo, is compatible with unbiased omics approaches, and is fully applicable to human samples.\nImpact\n        Our results offer a novel therapeutic strategy that could be applicable to prevent brain metastasis in a clinically relevant context. Furthermore, we demonstrate that METPlatform should be considered as a potential approach to facilitate the management of metastatic disease in the context of personalized cancer care.\nIntroduction\n      The incidence of brain metastasis continues to increase, yet current therapies available for patients with disseminated cancer cells in their central nervous system (CNS) have a limited efficacy and fail to improve survival (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2018; Moravan et\u00a0al, 2020; Suh et\u00a0al, 2020).\n      Consequently, during the past years, there have been recurrent efforts to improve clinical trial design and management specifically concerning this patient population (Lin et\u00a0al, 2013a, 2013b, 2015; Le Rhun et\u00a0al, 2021). However, the inclusion of patients with active CNS disease has been limited in the trials of the past, and this represents an unsolved issue (Arvold et\u00a0al, 2016). As a result, information regarding CNS clinical efficacy of most anti\u2010cancer agents that are FDA\u2010approved or in clinical trials is limited. Thus, exploring therapeutic vulnerabilities and corresponding pharmacological agents with high CNS activity in preclinical models are crucial to promote urgently needed prospective clinical trials that include patients with brain metastases (Camidge et\u00a0al, 2018).\n      \nIn vivo drug\u2010screening using mouse models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical phenotype imposes high demand of economic costs, time, and resources (Gao et\u00a0al, 2015) that are unaffordable by most academical research institutions. On the other hand, cell\u2010based assays lack the contribution of the tumor\u2010associated microenvironment, which has gained relevance in the context of response to therapy during recent years (Hirata & Sahai, 2017). In this regard, the brain microenvironment is a key aspect in the biology of CNS metastasis (Boire et\u00a0al, 2020) that has been demonstrated to limit therapeutic benefits of systemic therapy (Chen et\u00a0al, 2016).\n      To overcome limitations of both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro approaches, we report an ex\u00a0vivo organotypic culture\u2010based drug\u2010screening system: METPlatform. We use this strategy to evaluate the impact of different therapeutic agents on metastases growing in\u00a0situ (i.e., the brain), thus identifying biologically relevant drug candidates in a rapid and cost\u2010effective manner.\n      Brain organotypic cultures have been used in cancer research due to their ability to mimic the progression of metastatic disease locally (Zhu & Valiente, 2021). They resemble both early (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Er et\u00a0al, 2018) and advanced stages of the disease (Priego et\u00a0al, 2018). Their versatility allows exploring diverse functional and mechanistic insights of brain metastasis, including the\u00a0interaction between cancer cells and different components of the microenvironment using genetic or pharmacologic approaches (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Er et\u00a0al, 2018; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018). However, to the best of our knowledge, their use for drug\u2010screening has not been reported. We describe here the use of brain organotypic cultures for performing a medium\u2010throughput screening using an in\u2010house library of anti\u2010cancer agents, FDA\u2010approved, or under clinical development (Bejarano et\u00a0al, 2019), with unknown or limited information regarding their activity in the CNS.\n      In addition to other hits, METPlatform identified inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a potential target to increase the vulnerability of brain metastasis. HSP90 is a molecular chaperone required for correct protein folding, intracellular disposition, and proteolytic turnover of its client proteins, and therefore essential for cellular proteostasis (Schopf et\u00a0al, 2017). It is heavily exploited by cancer cells not only to maintain numerous pro\u2010survival oncoproteins and transcription factors, but also to buffer proteotoxic stress induced during oncogenic transformation and progression (Whitesell & Lindquist, 2005) as well as to regulate mechanisms of immune evasion (Fionda et\u00a0al, 2009; Kawabe et\u00a0al, 2009). High HSP90 expression levels have been correlated with poor prognosis in all subtypes of breast cancer patients (Pick et\u00a0al, 2007; Dimas et\u00a0al, 2018), several independent cohorts of non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (Gallegos Ruiz et\u00a0al, 2008), and in colorectal cancer (Kim et\u00a0al, 2019).\n      Following METPlatform identification of HSP90 as a potential target, we show the potent anti\u2010metastatic activity of a second\u2010generation HSP90 inhibitor, DEBIO\u20100932, in experimental and human metastases. Furthermore, we use METPlatform to dissect the underlying biology downstream of HSP90 inhibition using unbiased proteomics to identify novel mediators of brain metastasis, biomarkers of the disease, and combination strategies to overcome resistance.\n      As a final proof\u2010of\u2010concept, we show that METPlatform could be additionally exploited as a clinically compatible \u201cavatar\u201d to predict the therapeutic response of patients with brain tumors.\nResults\n      \n        A chemical library applied to METPlatform identifies potential vulnerabilities of brain metastasis\n        Given our interest in targeting clinically relevant stages of brain metastasis, we used METPlatform to study vulnerabilities of macrometastases. The human lung adenocarcinoma brain metastatic (BrM) cell line H2030\u2010BrM (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009) was injected intracardially into athymic nude mice to obtain fully established brain metastases at clinical endpoint of the animals. Brains were processed into organotypic cultures, and the efficacy of the anti\u2010tumoral library (Table\u00a0EV1) was evaluated at a concentration of 10\u00a0\u00b5M (Fig\u00a01A). Of note, established methods to assess the viability of this preparation such as LDH detection from dead cells showed a slight increase during the initial stages of culture preparation, which could be associated with sample processing since it gets stabilized during culture (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1A). Given the expression of luciferase and GFP in the H2030\u2010BrM model (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009), the impact of specific inhibitors on the viability of brain metastases in organotypic cultures was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and immunofluorescence against GFP in comparison with DMSO\u2010treated cultures. We used a PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, as an internal positive control in our experiments due to the known involvement of this signaling pathway and therapeutic benefit in brain metastasis (Nanni et\u00a0al, 2012; Brastianos et\u00a0al, 2015; Pistilli et\u00a0al, 2018). In addition to reproduce the efficacy of BKM120, METPlatform identified additional compounds that are superior in their ability to compromise the viability of established brain metastasis (Fig\u00a01B and C). Top hits were selected by reducing in 80% or more the bioluminescence values that correspond to controls treated with DMSO (Fig\u00a01B). This threshold was confirmed to be a good correlate of compromised viability based on a complementary histological analysis (Fig\u00a01C). The analysis of the drug\u2010screen provided us with 17 hits: carfilzomib (#1), dovitinib (#9), trametinib (#22), mitomycin C (#39), GSK2126458 (#44), AT7519 (#52), CNIO\u2010DUAL (#56), sorafenib (#59), geldanamycin (#60), SN\u201038 (#72), bortezomib (#84), KU\u201057788 (#87), CNIO\u2010TRIPLE (#104), crizotinib (#106), CNIO\u2010ATR (#107), pazopanib (#110), and linifanib (#113) out of 114 compounds tested (Fig\u00a01B and C, Table\u00a0EV1).\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            A chemical library applied to METPlatform identifies potential vulnerabilities of brain metastasis\n            \nSchema of the experimental design.Quantification of the bioluminescence signal emitted by established H2030\u2010BrM brain metastases in each organotypic culture at day 3 normalized by their initial value at day 0 (before the addition of DMSO or any compound).

Values are shown in box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots where each dot is an organotypic culture and the line in the box corresponds to the median. The boxes go from the upper to the lower quartiles and the whiskers go from the minimum to the maximum value (n\u00a0=\u00a04 organotypic cultures per experimental condition, 2 independent experiments). P\u00a0value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.Quantification of the concentration of DEBIO\u20100932 reached in animals harboring H2030\u2010BrM established brain metastases 6\u00a0h after oral administration of DEBIO\u20100932 at 160\u00a0mg/kg. The concentration was measured in both the plasma and the brain for each mouse. Values are shown as mean\u00a0+\u00a0s.e.m. (n\u00a0=\u00a03 mice per experimental condition). P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        To compare METPlatform with a traditional cell\u2010based assay as a drug\u2010screening platform, we applied the same chemical library to H2030\u2010BrM cells cultured in\u00a0vitro (Fig\u00a0EV1A). Interestingly, after applying the same criteria based on luminescence, only 7 out of 14 hits obtained in\u00a0vitro were part of the 17 hits obtained with METPlatform (Figs\u00a01D and EV1C, Table\u00a0EV1). Even if these hits were applied to H2030\u2010BrM spheroids, only 7 out of 17 also scored (Figs\u00a01D and EV1C, Table\u00a0EV1). Thus, METPlatform selected hits that would not have been considered as such with other established approaches.\n        \n          Figure EV1\n          \n            A chemical library applied to METPlatform identifies potential vulnerabilities of brain metastasis\n            \nQuantification of the proliferation of H2030\u2010BrM cells at day 3 normalized to the cells treated with DMSO measured with CellTiter\u2010Glo\u00ae.

Values are shown in box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots where the line in the box corresponds to the mean. Each experimental compound of the library was assayed by duplicate. Hits highlighted in bold were common to the ex\u00a0vivo screening (Fig\u00a01B).Quantification of the bioluminescence signal from MDA231\u2010BrM established brain metastases in organotypic culture after 3\u00a0days in culture. Values were normalized by the level of bioluminescence at Day 0 for each culture (before the addition of DMSO or any compound). Final data is shown in percentage respect to reference, the organotypic cultures treated with DMSO. Blue: DMSO\u2010treated organotypic cultures; red: hits, compounds with normalized BLI\u00a0\u2264\u00a020% (dashed line); green: BKM120; gray: compounds with normalized BLI\u00a0>\u00a020%. Values are shown in box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots where the line in the box corresponds to the mean. Boxes extend from the minimum to the maximum value (n\u00a0=\u00a014 DMSO; n\u00a0=\u00a013 BKM120\u2010treated organotypic cultures; each experimental compound was assayed by duplicate, 4 independent experiments).Detailed representation of the data shown in Figs\u00a01B, EV1A and Table\u00a0EV1 indicating relative viability using bioluminescence generated by H2030\u2010BrM cells ex\u00a0vivo (established brain metastases, light red), in\u00a0vitro 2D (green) and in\u00a0vitro 3D (spheroids, yellow) treated with compounds of the anti\u2010tumoral library (compounds were assayed by duplicate in each assay). All hits for any condition are shown. The rectangles of the top indicate whether a given compound was effective (<\u00a020% luminescence respect to control) ex\u00a0vivo (light red rectangle), in\u00a0vitro 2D (green rectangle), in\u00a0vitro 3D (yellow rectangle).Representative wild\u2010type brain slices treated with DMSO or the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin stained with anti\u2010Col.IV (endothelial cells) and anti\u2010NeuN (neurons).

Nine serial concentrations of geldanamycin were assayed by duplicate and GI50 was calculated from a viability curve normalized to DMSO\u2010treated cells of the corresponding cell line. Values are shown as mean\u00a0+\u00a0s.e.m. (each concentration was assayed by technical duplicates for each cell line and the experiment was performed twice).Quantification of the bioluminescence signal emitted by MDA231\u2010BrM established metastases in organotypic cultures incubated in the presence of DEBIO\u20100932 (1\u00a0\u00b5M) during 3\u00a0days. Bioluminescence at Day 3 is normalized by the initial value obtained at day D and quantified relative to the organotypic cultures treated with DMSO. Day 0 is considered right before addition of the treatment or DMSO. Values are shown in box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots where each dot is an organotypic culture and the line in the box corresponds to the median. The boxes go from the upper to the lower quartiles and the whiskers go from the minimum to the maximum value (n\u00a0=\u00a06 organotypic cultures per experimental condition, 1 experiment). P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        We extended our ex\u00a0vivo drug\u2010screen to a triple\u2010negative breast cancer brain metastasis model, MDA231\u2010BrM (Bos et\u00a0al, 2009), to identify vulnerabilities regardless the primary tumor origin. Out of the 17 hits tested, 15 of them decreased the viability of cancer cells in 80% or more as measured by BLI (Figs\u00a01D and EV1B, Table\u00a0EV1). In addition, we used METPlatform to analyze whether any hit also scored not only against advanced stages of the disease when metastases are fully established (Fig\u00a01B), but also against the initial steps of organ colonization, which could be mimicked ex\u00a0vivo by plating cancer cells on top of tumor\u2010free organotypic brain cultures (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014). Interestingly, 14 out of 17 hits inhibited both early and advanced stages of brain metastasis (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV1), which suggests that these compounds may not only be effective treating, but also preventing metastasis outgrowth by acting on the initiation of organ colonization. On the other hand, reported differences in the biology of initial and established brain metastases (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) could be exploited therapeutically by interrogating those hits only scoring in one or another stage of colonization (dovitinib (#9), pazopanib (#110), and linifanib (#113)) (Table\u00a0EV1).\n        Finally, METPlatform also allows simultaneous evaluation of the potential toxicity derived from selected compounds on non\u2010cancer cell types and in different organs. For instance, the use of specific markers for various brain cell types, such as neurons and endothelial cells, allowed us to discard a major unselective cytotoxicity in this organ (Fig\u00a0EV1D). In contrast, evaluation of reported sensitive organs confirmed the ability of the drug\u2010screening platform to reproduce clinical toxicity (i.e., hepatotoxicity) (Fig\u00a0EV1E; Supko et\u00a0al, 1995).\n        Altogether, our results support METPlatform as a comprehensive and more informative drug\u2010screening platform in the context of metastasis compared to conventional cell\u2010based assays (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV1).\n        In order to select compounds for further validation, we focused on those targeting not only established metastasis from different cancer types but also initial stages of organ colonization (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV1). Out of this selection, we then focused on those that, although with inhibitory activity 2D and 3D in\u00a0vitro (Fig\u00a0EV1F), did not score as hits in this condition (Fig\u00a0EV1A and C). With this selection criterion, we wanted to evaluate the potential of METPlatform to select hits working in\u00a0vivo. Six hits fulfilled the criteria: trametinib (#22), AT7519 (#52), sorafenib (#59), geldanamycin (#60), KU\u201057788 (#87), and CNIO\u2010ATR (#107). Unfortunately, METPlatform has no capacity to score blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB)/blood\u2013tumor barrier (BTB) permeability, and indeed, we failed to recognize this property among these compounds, suggesting that, when METPlatform is applied to metastasis in the brain, a previous step to prioritize BBB/ BTB\u2010permeable compounds should be incorporated to design the library (Saxena et\u00a0al, 2019). Given the improved efficacy of brain permeable compounds to target metastasis in this organ (Osswald et\u00a0al, 2016), we looked for alternative inhibitors focused on the targets identified. DEBIO\u20100932, a second\u2010generation HSP90 inhibitor, has an improved toxicity profile in comparison with geldanamycin, increased bioavailability and, more importantly, a remarkable ability to cross the BBB (Supko et\u00a0al, 1995; Bao et\u00a0al, 2009). As geldanamycin, DEBIO\u20100932 blunted the viability of initial and established brain metastases from lung (H2030\u2010BrM) and breast (MDA231\u2010BrM) cancer models in ex\u00a0vivo assays (Figs\u00a01 E\u2013I and Fig\u00a0EV1G, Table\u00a0EV10). Furthermore, the concentration reached by DEBIO\u20100932 in a brain affected by metastases (Fig\u00a01J) is above the therapeutic levels as determined ex\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a01E\u2013I).\n        Given the importance of the metastasis\u2010associated microenvironment for local disease progression (Boire et\u00a0al, 2020), we evaluated in more detail this aspect in METPlatform (Fig\u00a02A). First, we determine that the vehicle used was not influencing the brain microenvironment at the concentration used (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1B). Second, we introduced inhibitors previously reported to influence glial cells such as methotrexate (MTX) (Gibson et\u00a0al, 2019) and BKM120 (Blazquez et\u00a0al, 2018). In comparison with DEBIO\u20100932, MTX massively induced tumor\u2010associated microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes (Fig\u00a02B) markers, although this was not translated into a compromise of metastasis viability as assessed by histology and bioluminescence (Fig\u00a02B and C). Finally, although established methods for assessing major toxicity effects (i.e., LDH) did not reflect any major impact from any compound (Fig\u00a02D), high concentrations of BKM120 and DEBIO\u20100932 showed incipient signs of their impact on the tumor\u2010associated microenvironment (Fig\u00a02B). Given that low concentrations used for DEBIO\u20100932 had a major effect on the viability of metastatic cells (Figs\u00a01F\u2013I and 2C), we conclude that METPlatform not only identified potential vulnerabilities but it also allows to evaluate the differential sensitivity of cancer cells versus tumor\u2010associated microenvironment to a given drug. Given the limited efforts to test drugs currently available or under clinical trials in patients with brain metastasis, METPlatform provides an additional strategy to generate initial data on this potential application. As such, we identified DEBIO\u20100932 as a potent inhibitor of brain metastases viability ex\u00a0vivo that is able to accumulate in the brain at therapeutic concentrations.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            METPlatform is compatible with the evaluation of the metastasis\u2010associated microenvironment\n            \nSchema of the experimental design.Representative images of organotypic cultures with established metastases with various glial components of the microenvironment labeled.

The boxes go from the upper to the lower quartiles and the whiskers go from the minimum to the maximum value (n\u00a0=\u00a05\u20136 organotypic cultures, 1 independent experiment).

To evaluate HSP90 levels in\u00a0situ, we performed tissue immunofluorescence in four experimental brain metastasis models from both human and mouse origin, characterized by different oncogenic drivers and derived from breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, which are the most frequent sources of brain metastasis (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2020). Established brain metastases obtained at experimental endpoint showed high HSP90 levels in cancer cells (Fig\u00a03B). In sharp contrast, the unaffected brain did not show any positivity with the exception of specific neuronal nuclei, such as the medial habenula (Fig\u00a03A). Of interest, metastasis\u2010associated Iba1+ microglia/macrophages showed high intensity of HSP90; however, they were outnumbered by HSP90high cancer cells (Fig\u00a03C). Thus, we focus our efforts on the characterization of the drug target in metastatic cells.\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Brain metastases are positive for HSP90\n            \nA\u2013CImmunofluorescence against HSP90 in mouse brains with established metastases.

Black arrows point to cancer cells positive for HSP90 in the nucleus.LQuantification of nuclear HSP90 in human brain metastases. 54 out of 60 samples (90%) showed positive nuclear HSP90 in the tumor. 27 (45%) showed 1\u20135% (moderate) and 27 (45%) showed >\u00a05% (high) of nuclear HSP90.MQuantification of nuclear HSP90 in human primary tumors. 19 out of 30 (63%) showed positive nuclear HSP90 in the tumor. 9 (30%) showed 1\u20135% (moderate) and 10 (33%) showed >\u00a05% (high) of nuclear HSP90.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        60 paraffin\u2010embedded human brain metastases from NSCLC (40 samples) and breast adenocarcinoma (20 samples) were stained with anti\u2010HSP90 by immunohistochemistry and blindly evaluated and scored by a pathologist (Fig\u00a03D, Table\u00a0EV2). 98% of brain metastases were positive for HSP90, with 85% of them showing moderate or strong staining of the protein (score \u2265\u00a02, HSP90high) (Fig\u00a03E and F), which is a value higher than previous reports on primary tumors (Pick et\u00a0al, 2007; Gallegos Ruiz et\u00a0al, 2008; Kim et\u00a0al, 2019). To investigate this possibility, we scored 30 matched primary tumors (Fig\u00a03G) and confirmed a lower percentage (54%) of samples scoring as HSP90high in comparison to brain metastases (Fig\u00a03H). When comparing matched pairs of a primary tumor and a brain metastasis, 13/30 (43%) brain metastases had increased HSP90 levels compared to the primary tumor, from which 10/13 (77%) switched from HSP90low (score \u2264\u00a01) to HSP90high (score \u2265\u00a02). 12/30 (40%) matched pairs showed equal HSP90 levels; however, 8/12 (67%) cases were HSP90high in the primary tumor to start with. Out of the 5/30 (17%) brain metastases with lower HSP90 than the corresponding primary tumor, 3/5 (60%) cases still remained within the HSP90high category and only 2/5 (40%) switched from HSP90high to HSP90low (Fig\u00a03I).\n        Although HSP90 is primarily a cytoplasmic protein, several studies have described its role in nuclear events such as transcriptional processes, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage (Trepel et\u00a0al, 2010; Antonova et\u00a0al, 2019). Moreover, increased nuclear HSP90 correlated positively with poor survival and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients (Su et\u00a0al, 2016). Interestingly, we found nuclear staining of HSP90 in 90% of brain metastasis samples (Fig\u00a03J\u2013L), with 45% of them scoring as HSP90high (>\u00a05% of positive nuclei out of total tumor) according to a previously described criteria (Su et\u00a0al, 2016) (Fig\u00a03L). Similar to the previous analysis, we found fewer primary tumors (63%) positive for nuclear HSP90, with 33% of them scoring HSP90high (Fig\u00a03M). Nevertheless, due to the prevalent low percentage of positive nuclei observed in most samples (Fig\u00a03J), we were not able to accurately assess a potential enrichment of nuclear HSP90 in brain metastases compared to their paired primary tumor.\n        Taken together, our results demonstrate that high levels of HSP90 in cancer cells are a frequent finding among human brain metastasis independently of the primary tumor. Indeed, a clear tendency to maintain or further increase the levels of this protein is evident when compared to matched primary tumors. Overall, these results support potential functional implications of HSP90 in human brain metastasis.\n      \n      \n        Inhibition of HSP90 is effective to treat established brain metastasis\n        We used DEBIO\u20100932 in preclinical models to study whether the results obtained with METPlatform could be translated in\u00a0vivo.\n        Brain metastases were induced by intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM cells (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009). Two weeks after injection, we confirmed the presence of established metastases in the brain using BLI, histology, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig\u00a04A). DEBIO\u20100932 administration at 160\u00a0mg/kg during the following 3\u00a0weeks significantly impaired the growth of both brain metastases and extracranial lesions (Figs\u00a04B\u2013G and EV2F\u2013H) by targeting HSP90 in cancer cells (Fig\u00a0EV2A\u2013D; Bagatell et\u00a0al, 2000). We did not observe similar effects of DEBIO\u20100932 in the microenvironment (Fig\u00a0EV2E). These results were confirmed by brain and thorax ex\u00a0vivo BLI (Figs\u00a04B and EV2G and H) as well as histological quantification of dissected brains at the endpoint of the experiment, 5\u00a0weeks after cancer cell inoculation, including a reduction of metastases (Fig\u00a04E and F) with an increased in cancer cell death (Fig\u00a04E and G). Of note, we did not observe significant weight loss (Fig\u00a0EV2I), food intake (Fig\u00a0EV2J), or any other sign of toxicity after detailed multi\u2010organ histological analysis by an expert pathologist (Fig\u00a0EV2K) in treated animals compared to the control group, ruling out major toxicities of DEBIO\u20100932. Indeed, DEBIO\u20100932 monotherapy increased survival of treated mice (Fig\u00a0EV2L). However, rather than overinterpreting this significant but limited survival benefit, we use it as an added value reinforcing the need for further characterization of this therapeutic strategy derived from METPlatform. In this sense, treatment of established melanoma brain metastases (Fig\u00a0EV2N) in an immunocompetent background (Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) with DEBIO\u20100932 confirmed the anti\u2010metastatic phenotype (Fig\u00a0EV2M\u2013P).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            Inhibition of HSP90 is effective to treat established brain metastasis\n            \nSchema of the experimental design. H2030\u2010BrM cells were inoculated intracardially into nude mice and established brain metastases were detected 2\u00a0weeks after by BLI, MRI (arrows) and histology (GFP+ cancer cells). DEBIO\u20100932 was administered orally at 160\u00a0mg/kg for 3\u00a0weeks (daily during the first week and every 48\u00a0h during the two following weeks) and ex\u00a0vivo BLI of brains and thoracic regions were analyzed.

Although all but one BrM\u2010PDOC responded to high dose of DEBIO\u20100932 (Fig\u00a04I and J), decreasing the dose to levels compatible to those detected in mouse brains with metastases (Fig\u00a01J) correlated with the emergence of heterogeneity (Fig\u00a04J). The origin of such heterogeneous therapeutic response did not correlate with similar changes in the microenvironment (Fig\u00a04I) or any particular tumor origin (Fig\u00a04J). Indeed, although 9/19 BrM\u2010PDOC were not compatible with testing two doses due to limited sample availability, only 20% of those receiving them showed divergent responses between high and low DEBIO\u20100932 concentrations (Fig\u00a04K), suggesting that inter\u2010patient differences are more likely to explain this phenotype. Overall, 74% of BrM\u2010PDOC are sensitive to DEBIO\u20100932. In order to get to know the underlying molecular biomarker of HSP90 sensitivity and given that clinical response to HSP90 inhibitors has been attributed to \u201caddiction\u201d of tumors to particular oncogenes, such as HER2, ALK, ROS1, EGFR, and BRAF, which are sensitive HSP90 client proteins (Neckers & Workman, 2012), we had access to such information for a limited number of samples (10/19 samples). Among five brain metastases from NSCLC, two of them harbored a mutation/deletion in EGFR as detected by targeted sequencing (Fig\u00a0EV2R); however, no molecular alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 were found in the other three patients using standard methodologies approved in clinical practice for these biomarkers (Fig\u00a0EV2Q). Additional molecular classifiers included three brain metastases derived from HER2+ breast adenocarcinomas, one from a melanoma with the activating mutation BRAF V600E (Fig\u00a0EV2R), and one from a gastro\u2010esophageal cancer without known oncogenic drivers sensitive to HSP90 inhibition (Fig\u00a0EV2S).\n        These results validate METPlatform as an effective ex\u00a0vivo drug\u2010screening strategy for the identification of brain metastasis vulnerabilities, such as HSP90, that could be translated to in\u00a0vivo metastasis assays. Our results also show that METPlatform could be used to validate experimental therapeutic strategies in human samples, where DEBIO\u20100932 impairs the viability of the majority of BrM\u2010PDOC although with different response rates and independently of their primary tumor origin and established HSP90\u2010dependent oncogenes routinely scored in the clinical practice.\n      \n      \n        Inhibition of HSP90 prevents brain metastasis initiation as well as local relapse post\u2010surgery\n        Approximately 20\u201340% of patients with brain metastasis receive neurosurgery. However, local relapse occurs in 60% of patients within one year after surgery and limits the benefits of an otherwise successful local therapy (Nahed et\u00a0al, 2019; Dankner et\u00a0al, 2021). To investigate whether DEBIO\u20100932 is able to prevent this clinically relevant situation for which there is no established standard of care, we developed a first\u2010in\u2010class preclinical model of local relapse after brain metastasis neurosurgery.\n        We modelled single brain macrometastasis by intracranial implantation of H2030\u2010BrM cells. This strategy facilitates the surgical approach avoiding non\u2010operable brains with multiple secondary tumors or surgically non\u2010accessible locations of metastasis (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2020). Microsurgical resection of the metastasis guided by GFP was performed when BLI values reached 107\u00a0photons/s/cm\u00b2/steradian (Fig\u00a05A, B, G and I). Successful resection of the bulk tumor was confirmed in real time by the absence of macroscopically detectable GFP+ cancer cells and almost complete postsurgical reduction of BLI in\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a05A, B and D), which doubled the survival time compared to those animals without local treatment (Fig\u00a05C). However, the presence of single cancer cells left behind was also evident by microscopic analysis of the borders of the surgical bed one day after completing the local treatment (Fig\u00a05D). These cancer cells are presumably responsible for the local relapse affecting all treated mice as tumors always reappeared within the same area where mass debulking was initially applied (Fig\u00a05D and H). Full development of relapsed tumors occurred 5\u20136\u00a0weeks after surgery (Fig\u00a05H and I).\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Inhibition of HSP90 prevents brain metastasis initiation as well as local relapse post\u2010surgery\n            \nDetailed image of the neurosurgery procedure that visualizes the GFP+ brain tumor (high magnification) with a 480\u00a0nm light source and goggles equipped with emission filters.

P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        We addressed differences between resected and relapsed tumors using transcriptomic profiling by RNAseq. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the transcriptomes from relapsed versus matched resected tumors showed downregulated signatures related to cell cycle and proliferation and enrichment in those related to vascular co\u2010option, a key mechanism during the early stages of organ colonization (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Er et\u00a0al, 2018), and cytokine and integrin signaling (Fig\u00a05E, Table\u00a0EV3, Dataset EV1). In contrast, we validated that HSP90 coding genes and members of the heat shock response pathway were unaltered in relapsed tumors (Fig\u00a05F, Table\u00a0EV10).\n        Tumor reinitiation after surgery may involve similar mechanisms to those processes necessary during the early stages of brain colonization. Based on our data proving that DEBIO\u20100932 effectively targets the early stages of metastasis ex\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a01E\u2013G) and that HSP90\u2010related genes are equally represented in relapsed metastases (Fig\u00a05F), we hypothesized that DEBIO\u20100932 could be used to prevent relapse. First, we validated the efficacy of DEBIO\u20100932 to prevent metastasis initiation in\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a0EV3A\u2013G, Table\u00a0EV10) using H2030\u2010BrM as a model following an angio\u2010co\u2010optive growth pattern during metastasis initiation (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014). Subsequently, we used the HSP90 inhibitor in an adjuvant setting after neurosurgery. Although DEBIO\u20100932 administration at 160\u00a0mg/kg starting 3\u00a0days after surgery debuted with an initial impact limiting weight gain in mice, probably reflecting a more vulnerable health state post\u2010surgery, individualized systemic therapy (Fig\u00a0EV3H) stabilized treated mice and delayed local relapse (Fig\u00a05G\u2013I). Remarkably, the percentage of mice surviving above the median increased to 82% with three animals showing at least a 20% extension in overall survival, one of them with stable disease over 18\u00a0weeks (Fig\u00a0EV3I). However, survival benefits experienced by this arm did not reach statistical significance (Fig\u00a0EV3I). Nonetheless, mice treated with adjuvant anti\u2010HSP90 therapy experienced a less aggressive relapse as measured by the reduced systemic impact (i.e., weight loss) of uncontrolled tumor growth in the brain (Fig\u00a05J).\n        \n          Figure EV3\n          \n            Inhibition of HSP90 prevents brain metastasis initiation as well as local relapse post\u2010surgery\n            \nARepresentative images of mice treated with DEBIO\u20100932 (160\u00a0mg/kg, o.g.) starting at 7\u00a0days after intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM cells.

Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether METPlatform could additionally contribute to characterize downstream mechanisms following target inactivation using unbiased approaches. To identify acute biological responses following HSP90 inhibition, we treated organotypic cultures containing established H2030\u2010BrM brain metastases with DEBIO\u20100932 at 1\u00a0\u00b5M for 6\u00a0h. Laser capture microdissection of paraffin\u2010embedded metastatic lesions was followed by peptides identification by mass spectrometry (Fig\u00a06A and B). Short time treatment with DEBIO\u20100932 showed modest but statistically significant reduction of brain metastases as measured by BLI (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2A), allowing us to assess early changes after HSP90 inhibition in cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            \nIn situ proteomics uncovers HSP90\u2010dependent brain metastasis mediators\n            \nSchema of experimental design.

P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.O, QH\u2010score analysis of AHR (O) and DDA1 (R) in primary tumors with (red) or without (gray) associated relapse. Values are shown in a scattered plot where each dot is a primary tumor and the line corresponds to the median (n\u00a0=\u00a0100/103 primary tumors with relapse; n\u00a0=\u00a0101/103 primary tumors without relapse, respectively). P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.P, RKaplan\u2010Meier curve comparing relapse\u2010free survival of primary tumors with high and low values of AHR (P) and DDA1 (R). P value was calculated using log\u2010rank (Mantel\u2010Cox) test.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        Downregulated proteins upon DEBIO\u20100932 treatment are potential HSP90\u2010dependent mediators of brain metastasis (Fig\u00a06C). Interestingly, 50% of top downregulated signatures upon HSP90 inhibition belong to nuclear signaling pathways that include DNA\u2010binding proteins and transcription factor (Fig\u00a06D, Table\u00a0EV4, Appendix\u00a0Fig S2B), and four out of five top downregulated proteins (AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), DDA1 (DET1 and DDB1 associated 1), UBE4B (ubiquitination factor E4B), and GPATCH8 (G\u2010patch domain containing 8)) (Fig\u00a06C) have been shown to be able to translocate into the nucleus (Fig\u00a06E and F) (Murray et\u00a0al, 2014; Du et\u00a0al, 2016; Cheng et\u00a0al, 2017). Within the nuclear compartment, the association of AHR and UBE4B with euchromatin reinforces the possibility of a functional role at this subcellular location (Fig\u00a06F). In addition to previous findings (Fig\u00a03J\u2013L), our results suggest a prominent role for HSP90 or HSP90\u2010dependent downstream program in the nucleus of secondary brain tumors. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the impact of DEBIO\u20100932 on cytoplasmic HSP90 clients, including cancer\u2010related kinases, in brain metastasis. In fact, a reduction in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) was detected in organotypic cultures with established brain metastases treated with DEBIO\u20100932 (Fig\u00a0EV4D) in line with previously reported studies (Bao et\u00a0al, 2009).\n        In patients, high versus low HSP90\u2010dependent four gene signature score (AHR, DDA1, UBE4B, and GPATCH8) in brain metastatic tumors associate with worse patient prognosis and aggressive clinical disease (Figs\u00a06G and EV4E\u2013H) in an extended cohort (GSE184869) of a previously published dataset of breast cancer patients (Vare\u0161lija et\u00a0al, 2019) and independently of the cancer subtype (Fig\u00a0EV4I and J). Additionally, AHR, DDA1, and UBE4B protein were detected in all tissue samples analyzed from an additional cohort of brain metastases independently of primary tumor source and the presence of clinically validated HSP90\u2010dependent oncogenes (Fig\u00a06H, Appendix\u00a0Fig S2C, Table\u00a0EV5).\n        In order to evaluate the functional contribution of the HSP90\u2010dependent signature, we performed functional assays in\u00a0vivo. Genetic knockdown identified AHR as functionally relevant in lung adenocarcinoma brain metastases (Figs\u00a06I\u2013K and EV4K\u2013N). Similar to the pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 (Figs\u00a04B\u2013D and EV2F\u2013H), loss of function of AHR also reduced extracranial metastases (Figs\u00a06K and EV4L). A complementary pharmacologic approach (Fig\u00a06L) confirmed that this novel brain metastasis mediator, part of the HSP90\u2010dependent signature of poor prognosis, should be also considered as a potential therapeutic target.\n        Although monogenic loss of function of UBE4B or DDA1 did not allow us to conclude about their involvement in brain metastasis, we cannot discard that the trends observed in\u00a0vivo (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2D and E) would require an alternative approach targeting these candidates simultaneously. Indeed, the evaluation of an ER+ breast cancer cohort with a 10\u2010year follow\u2010up (Fig\u00a06M, Table\u00a0EV6), identified increased AHR, DDA1, and UBE4B levels in the primary tumors that relapsed (Figs\u00a06O, EV4O and Q, Table\u00a0EV7). The strong association seen with UBE4B was also predictive of relapse\u2010free survival (Fig\u00a06P), while DDA1 and AHR failed to score in this analysis (Figs EV6P and Fig EV6R). Of note, within the 251 cases in this cohort only 3 relapses correspond to metastases in the brain (Table\u00a0EV7), which reinforces the association of the HSP90\u2010dependent signature with multi\u2010organ metastases. Indeed, in a reduced number of eight matched samples including primaries that relapsed later on and their corresponding metastases (Table\u00a0EV8) we observed that mean H score showed a trend to be higher in metastases than in the primary tumor (Table\u00a0EV8).\n        Consequently, METPlatform could be coupled with unbiased omic approaches to provide a detailed molecular map of drug response in\u00a0situ, which could facilitate the discovery of potential clinically relevant biomarkers.\n      \n      \n        METPlatform facilitates unbiased identification of synergistic drug combinations against brain metastasis\n        Despite the encouraging pharmacological results obtained with DEBIO\u20100932 in\u00a0vivo (Figs\u00a04B\u2013G, EV2M\u2013P, 5G\u2013I, EV3A\u2013F), control of metastatic disease could still be improved (Figs\u00a0EV2L, EV2O, EV3G, and EV3I). Additionally, synergistic drug combinations are aimed to maximize sensitivity over tumor cells while minimizing toxicity in normal cells, which has been a limiting factor for the use of HSP90 inhibitors in patients (Neckers & Workman, 2012).\n        Our proteomic analysis on DEBIO\u20100932 treatment identified the upregulation of multiple signatures representing adhesion, migration, and interaction with the matrix as well as increased lysosome activity (Fig\u00a06D, Appendix\u00a0Fig S2, Table\u00a0EV4), all of which are known mechanisms involved in therapeutic resistance (Sui et\u00a0al, 2013; Orgaz et\u00a0al, 2020). Given that lysosome activity is tightly linked to autophagy (Sui et\u00a0al, 2013) and previous studies reported the induction of autophagy by HSP90 inhibitors in cancer (Liu et\u00a0al, 2012; Samarasinghe et\u00a0al, 2014; Mori et\u00a0al, 2015; He et\u00a0al, 2016; Zhao et\u00a0al, 2019), we decided to explore this process as a potential actionable resistance mechanism to HSP90 inhibition in brain metastasis. In addition to the upregulation of the autophagy\u2010related protein ATG7 (Levy et\u00a0al, 2017) (Fig\u00a06C), we noticed that the early response of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition induced the accumulation of the adaptor protein p62 or sequestosome\u20101 (Fig\u00a07A and B). As an additional evidence of the molecular crosstalk between HSP90 and autophagy in brain metastasis, we used a probe that labels the flux of lysosomal degradation based on GFP\u2010tagged LC3 (Kaizuka et\u00a0al, 2016). Given the unavailability of H2030\u2010BrM or MDA231\u2010BrM cell lines lacking the GFP reporter (Bos et\u00a0al, 2009; Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009; Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Chen et\u00a0al, 2016; Valiente, 2020) and that DEBIO\u20100932 efficacy on brain metastasis is independent of the primary source (Figs\u00a01D, EV1B, EV1G, Table\u00a0EV1, Figs\u00a04J, EV2 O and P), we used the reporter\u2010free melanoma brain metastatic cell line B16/F10\u2010BrM (Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) for this purpose (Fig\u00a07C). Treatment of B16/F10\u2010BrM organotypic brain cultures with DEBIO\u20100932 decreased the amount of GFP\u2010LC3+ vesicles, which indicates enhanced autophagic flux (Fig\u00a07D and E). Of note, the same probe also encodes an autophagy\u2010independent RFP reporter, which does not change in the presence of DEBIO\u20100932 (Fig\u00a07D). Based on the above findings indicating increased autophagy upon DEBIO\u20100932 treatment, we combined it with the broadly used autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Mauvezin et\u00a0al, 2015). Combined therapy with both inhibitors in established lung adenocarcinoma H2030\u2010BrM brain metastases ex\u00a0vivo showed synergistic effects compared to sublethal concentration of DEBIO\u20100932 (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3). However, bafilomycin A1 did not progress to clinical development due to its poor toxicity profile in\u00a0vivo causing disturbances in locomotor control and convulsions (Keeling et\u00a0al, 1997; DeVorkin & Lum, 2014). Therefore, we looked for alternative compounds able to block autophagy and superior ability to cross the BBB. The FDA\u2010approved anti\u2010psychotic drug chlorpromazine fulfills these two requirements (Fig\u00a07G) (Nadanaciva et\u00a0al, 2011). As predicted based on our findings, the combination of sublethal concentration of DEBIO\u20100932 with the CNS\u2010related drug chlorpromazine (Fig\u00a07F) was effective against H2030\u2010BrM (Fig\u00a07H) as well as B16/F10\u2010BrM (Fig\u00a07I) brain metastases ex\u00a0vivo. However, translation of this combination therapy in\u00a0vivo has not been successful (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3G) potentially derived from the secondary effects (i.e., long\u2010term drowsiness accompanied with weight loss) (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3C and D) of chlorpromazine at the dose required to detect brain levels (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3I) and its negative impact, even at lower concentration used (5\u00a0mg/kg) on decreasing the accumulation of DEBIO\u20100932 in the brain (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3H). In an effort to evaluate an alternative member of the same class of autophagy inhibitors, trifluoperazine was used (Xia et\u00a0al, 2021). However, similar in\u00a0vivo findings emerged including the need to limit its dose because of toxic effects when combined (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3E and F) as well as a similar dramatic reduction of DEBIO\u20100932 accumulation in the brain (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3H). In this case, even though the dose of trifluoperazine had to be reduced early on (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3E and F), the compound was still detected in the brain (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3J).\n        \n          Figure 7\n          \n            METPlatform facilitates unbiased identification of synergistic drug combinations against brain metastasis\n            \nSchema of experimental design.

METPlatform is a valuable tool for metastasis research that integrates drug\u2010screening and omic approaches to study pharmacological and biological vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that one vulnerability corresponds to the dependency on HSP90. The BBB\u2010permeable HSP90 inhibitor DEBIO\u20100932 is an effective therapeutic strategy against established brain metastasis and the analysis of such phenotype with in\u00a0situ proteomics revealed potential novel mediators of brain metastasis downstream HSP90. At the same time, autophagy appears as an actionable mechanism of resistance upon HSP90 inhibition, allowing design of rationale combinations using autophagy inhibitors and DEBIO\u20100932 to target brain metastasis more effectively if appropriate drugs could be combined in\u00a0vivo.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        Thus, the use of METPlatform to identify combination strategies that could be more effective against metastasis also involves its limitation to predict crucial pharmacokinetic aspects at the organismal level. Consequently, METPlatform must be conceived as a strategy to facilitate the initial testing of novel concepts for drug repurposing (i.e., the use of an anti\u2010psychotic drug to compromise brain metastasis) (Fig\u00a07J), favoring the reduction of the use of animal models rather than the replacement of in\u00a0vivo validation, a crucial step to define the viability of a therapeutic strategy.\n      \n      \n        METPlatform as a clinically compatible \u201cavatar\u201d\n        A major benefit of METPlatform would derive from its use as a strategy for personalized medicine, for instance by providing a fast readout on the efficacy of postsurgical adjuvant treatments. To evaluate PDOC as ex\u00a0vivo \u201cavatars\u201d of cancer patients, we performed a proof\u2010of\u2010concept substantiation with glioblastoma (GB) diagnosed de novo. In contrast to the lack of standard of care after neurosurgery in patients with brain metastasis, those with GB invariably receive radiotherapy plus temozolomide (Fig\u00a08A) (Stupp et\u00a0al, 2005, 2009). We initially tested the combination of radiation and temozolomide in 17 glioblastoma patient\u2010derived organotypic cultures (GB\u2010PDOC) to demonstrate the existence of responders (R) (Fig\u00a0EV5B) and non\u2010responders (NR) (Fig\u00a0EV5C) to the standard of care, as well as the consistency of such category (R vs. NR) in a broad concentration range of the alkylating agent (Fig\u00a0EV5A\u2013D, Table\u00a0EV10). Additionally, we confirmed that the decrease in proliferation (Fig\u00a0EV5B) matched the sustained induction of DNA damage upon treatment (Fig\u00a0EV5E and F), thus confirming this readout to asses therapeutic response to the combination therapy, as previously reported (Oldrini et\u00a0al, 2020). Finally, we evaluated that GB\u2010PDOC did not experience a different degree of compromised viability compared to our previous results (Fig\u00a02D, Appendix\u00a0Fig S1) with this unspecific assay (Fig\u00a0EV5G).\n        \n          Figure 8\n          \n            METPlatform as a clinically compatible \u201cavatar\u201d\n            \nSchema of experimental design using GB\u2010PDOC.Correlation between response in GB\u2010PDOC (left side of the graph) and its respective patient (right side of the graph).

The dotted line indicates the median. Each dot corresponds to a patient. Green dots: patient with stable disease; white dots: patients with progressive disease. The red line labels those patients with a reduction above 40% in cancer cell proliferation in the corresponding GB\u2010PDOC.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        In order to evaluate whether GB\u2010PDOC recapitulate patient response to radiotherapy and temozolomide, we compared the response of fourteen GB\u2010PDOC treated with the standard of care during seven days with the clinical response of matched patients at initial MRI post\u2010therapy. In addition, we evaluated the MGMT methylation status, an established predictive biomarker of response to this therapy (Hegi et\u00a0al, 2005; Stupp et\u00a0al, 2005, 2009) (Fig\u00a08A and B, Table\u00a0EV6). GB\u2010PDOC showing cancer cell proliferation under 40% as compared to the corresponding untreated PDOC from the same patient were considered responders (Fig\u00a08B). At data cutoff in September 2021, all patients had been evaluated for response to the standard of care and were classified as progressive (non\u2010responder, NR) or stable disease (responder, R), with the last ones showing ongoing response at time of cutoff (Fig\u00a08B, Table\u00a0EV9). Remarkably, GB\u2010PDOC predicted clinical response of their respective patient in 86% of the cases (Fig\u00a08B\u2013D, Table\u00a0EV9). In contrast, MGMT methylation status correlated with patient response in 50% of the cases (Fig\u00a08B and D, Table\u00a0EV9). Post hoc data analysis at cutoff defined that a ratio above 0.2 between the time of sustained patient response and the percentage of proliferation in treated GB\u2010PDOC defined the category of stable disease in 87% of the patients (7/8 patients with stable disease) (Fig\u00a0EV5H, Table\u00a0EV9). Interestingly, 86% (6/7) of the patients with a ratio above 0.2 have less than 40% of proliferative cancer cells in their matched GB\u2010PDOC (Fig\u00a0EV5H, Table\u00a0EV9), confirming its relevance to define response or lack of thereof in this cohort of patients.\n        Consequently, this preliminary finding suggests that METPlatform might have potential predictive value as a clinically compatible patient \u201cavatar\u201d. However, in order to conclude about METPlatform as a realistic strategy to improve personalized cancer care the current limited data must be significantly expanded to additional clinical cohorts.\nA chemical library applied to METPlatform identifies potential vulnerabilities of brain metastasis\n        Given our interest in targeting clinically relevant stages of brain metastasis, we used METPlatform to study vulnerabilities of macrometastases. The human lung adenocarcinoma brain metastatic (BrM) cell line H2030\u2010BrM (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009) was injected intracardially into athymic nude mice to obtain fully established brain metastases at clinical endpoint of the animals. Brains were processed into organotypic cultures, and the efficacy of the anti\u2010tumoral library (Table\u00a0EV1) was evaluated at a concentration of 10\u00a0\u00b5M (Fig\u00a01A). Of note, established methods to assess the viability of this preparation such as LDH detection from dead cells showed a slight increase during the initial stages of culture preparation, which could be associated with sample processing since it gets stabilized during culture (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1A). Given the expression of luciferase and GFP in the H2030\u2010BrM model (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009), the impact of specific inhibitors on the viability of brain metastases in organotypic cultures was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and immunofluorescence against GFP in comparison with DMSO\u2010treated cultures. We used a PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, as an internal positive control in our experiments due to the known involvement of this signaling pathway and therapeutic benefit in brain metastasis (Nanni et\u00a0al, 2012; Brastianos et\u00a0al, 2015; Pistilli et\u00a0al, 2018). In addition to reproduce the efficacy of BKM120, METPlatform identified additional compounds that are superior in their ability to compromise the viability of established brain metastasis (Fig\u00a01B and C). Top hits were selected by reducing in 80% or more the bioluminescence values that correspond to controls treated with DMSO (Fig\u00a01B). This threshold was confirmed to be a good correlate of compromised viability based on a complementary histological analysis (Fig\u00a01C). The analysis of the drug\u2010screen provided us with 17 hits: carfilzomib (#1), dovitinib (#9), trametinib (#22), mitomycin C (#39), GSK2126458 (#44), AT7519 (#52), CNIO\u2010DUAL (#56), sorafenib (#59), geldanamycin (#60), SN\u201038 (#72), bortezomib (#84), KU\u201057788 (#87), CNIO\u2010TRIPLE (#104), crizotinib (#106), CNIO\u2010ATR (#107), pazopanib (#110), and linifanib (#113) out of 114 compounds tested (Fig\u00a01B and C, Table\u00a0EV1).\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            A chemical library applied to METPlatform identifies potential vulnerabilities of brain metastasis\n            \nSchema of the experimental design.Quantification of the bioluminescence signal emitted by established H2030\u2010BrM brain metastases in each organotypic culture at day 3 normalized by their initial value at day 0 (before the addition of DMSO or any compound).

P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        To compare METPlatform with a traditional cell\u2010based assay as a drug\u2010screening platform, we applied the same chemical library to H2030\u2010BrM cells cultured in\u00a0vitro (Fig\u00a0EV1A). Interestingly, after applying the same criteria based on luminescence, only 7 out of 14 hits obtained in\u00a0vitro were part of the 17 hits obtained with METPlatform (Figs\u00a01D and EV1C, Table\u00a0EV1). Even if these hits were applied to H2030\u2010BrM spheroids, only 7 out of 17 also scored (Figs\u00a01D and EV1C, Table\u00a0EV1). Thus, METPlatform selected hits that would not have been considered as such with other established approaches.\n        \n          Figure EV1\n          \n            A chemical library applied to METPlatform identifies potential vulnerabilities of brain metastasis\n            \nQuantification of the proliferation of H2030\u2010BrM cells at day 3 normalized to the cells treated with DMSO measured with CellTiter\u2010Glo\u00ae.

Values are shown as mean\u00a0+\u00a0s.e.m.

Bioluminescence at Day 3 is normalized by the initial value obtained at day D and quantified relative to the organotypic cultures treated with DMSO. Day 0 is considered right before addition of the treatment or DMSO. Values are shown in box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots where each dot is an organotypic culture and the line in the box corresponds to the median. The boxes go from the upper to the lower quartiles and the whiskers go from the minimum to the maximum value (n\u00a0=\u00a06 organotypic cultures per experimental condition, 1 experiment). P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        We extended our ex\u00a0vivo drug\u2010screen to a triple\u2010negative breast cancer brain metastasis model, MDA231\u2010BrM (Bos et\u00a0al, 2009), to identify vulnerabilities regardless the primary tumor origin. Out of the 17 hits tested, 15 of them decreased the viability of cancer cells in 80% or more as measured by BLI (Figs\u00a01D and EV1B, Table\u00a0EV1). In addition, we used METPlatform to analyze whether any hit also scored not only against advanced stages of the disease when metastases are fully established (Fig\u00a01B), but also against the initial steps of organ colonization, which could be mimicked ex\u00a0vivo by plating cancer cells on top of tumor\u2010free organotypic brain cultures (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014). Interestingly, 14 out of 17 hits inhibited both early and advanced stages of brain metastasis (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV1), which suggests that these compounds may not only be effective treating, but also preventing metastasis outgrowth by acting on the initiation of organ colonization. On the other hand, reported differences in the biology of initial and established brain metastases (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) could be exploited therapeutically by interrogating those hits only scoring in one or another stage of colonization (dovitinib (#9), pazopanib (#110), and linifanib (#113)) (Table\u00a0EV1).\n        Finally, METPlatform also allows simultaneous evaluation of the potential toxicity derived from selected compounds on non\u2010cancer cell types and in different organs. For instance, the use of specific markers for various brain cell types, such as neurons and endothelial cells, allowed us to discard a major unselective cytotoxicity in this organ (Fig\u00a0EV1D). In contrast, evaluation of reported sensitive organs confirmed the ability of the drug\u2010screening platform to reproduce clinical toxicity (i.e., hepatotoxicity) (Fig\u00a0EV1E; Supko et\u00a0al, 1995).\n        Altogether, our results support METPlatform as a comprehensive and more informative drug\u2010screening platform in the context of metastasis compared to conventional cell\u2010based assays (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV1).\n        In order to select compounds for further validation, we focused on those targeting not only established metastasis from different cancer types but also initial stages of organ colonization (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV1). Out of this selection, we then focused on those that, although with inhibitory activity 2D and 3D in\u00a0vitro (Fig\u00a0EV1F), did not score as hits in this condition (Fig\u00a0EV1A and C). With this selection criterion, we wanted to evaluate the potential of METPlatform to select hits working in\u00a0vivo. Six hits fulfilled the criteria: trametinib (#22), AT7519 (#52), sorafenib (#59), geldanamycin (#60), KU\u201057788 (#87), and CNIO\u2010ATR (#107). Unfortunately, METPlatform has no capacity to score blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB)/blood\u2013tumor barrier (BTB) permeability, and indeed, we failed to recognize this property among these compounds, suggesting that, when METPlatform is applied to metastasis in the brain, a previous step to prioritize BBB/ BTB\u2010permeable compounds should be incorporated to design the library (Saxena et\u00a0al, 2019). Given the improved efficacy of brain permeable compounds to target metastasis in this organ (Osswald et\u00a0al, 2016), we looked for alternative inhibitors focused on the targets identified. DEBIO\u20100932, a second\u2010generation HSP90 inhibitor, has an improved toxicity profile in comparison with geldanamycin, increased bioavailability and, more importantly, a remarkable ability to cross the BBB (Supko et\u00a0al, 1995; Bao et\u00a0al, 2009). As geldanamycin, DEBIO\u20100932 blunted the viability of initial and established brain metastases from lung (H2030\u2010BrM) and breast (MDA231\u2010BrM) cancer models in ex\u00a0vivo assays (Figs\u00a01 E\u2013I and Fig\u00a0EV1G, Table\u00a0EV10). Furthermore, the concentration reached by DEBIO\u20100932 in a brain affected by metastases (Fig\u00a01J) is above the therapeutic levels as determined ex\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a01E\u2013I).\n        Given the importance of the metastasis\u2010associated microenvironment for local disease progression (Boire et\u00a0al, 2020), we evaluated in more detail this aspect in METPlatform (Fig\u00a02A). First, we determine that the vehicle used was not influencing the brain microenvironment at the concentration used (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1B). Second, we introduced inhibitors previously reported to influence glial cells such as methotrexate (MTX) (Gibson et\u00a0al, 2019) and BKM120 (Blazquez et\u00a0al, 2018). In comparison with DEBIO\u20100932, MTX massively induced tumor\u2010associated microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes (Fig\u00a02B) markers, although this was not translated into a compromise of metastasis viability as assessed by histology and bioluminescence (Fig\u00a02B and C). Finally, although established methods for assessing major toxicity effects (i.e., LDH) did not reflect any major impact from any compound (Fig\u00a02D), high concentrations of BKM120 and DEBIO\u20100932 showed incipient signs of their impact on the tumor\u2010associated microenvironment (Fig\u00a02B). Given that low concentrations used for DEBIO\u20100932 had a major effect on the viability of metastatic cells (Figs\u00a01F\u2013I and 2C), we conclude that METPlatform not only identified potential vulnerabilities but it also allows to evaluate the differential sensitivity of cancer cells versus tumor\u2010associated microenvironment to a given drug. Given the limited efforts to test drugs currently available or under clinical trials in patients with brain metastasis, METPlatform provides an additional strategy to generate initial data on this potential application. As such, we identified DEBIO\u20100932 as a potent inhibitor of brain metastases viability ex\u00a0vivo that is able to accumulate in the brain at therapeutic concentrations.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            METPlatform is compatible with the evaluation of the metastasis\u2010associated microenvironment\n            \nSchema of the experimental design.Representative images of organotypic cultures with established metastases with various glial components of the microenvironment labeled.

To evaluate HSP90 levels in\u00a0situ, we performed tissue immunofluorescence in four experimental brain metastasis models from both human and mouse origin, characterized by different oncogenic drivers and derived from breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, which are the most frequent sources of brain metastasis (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2020). Established brain metastases obtained at experimental endpoint showed high HSP90 levels in cancer cells (Fig\u00a03B). In sharp contrast, the unaffected brain did not show any positivity with the exception of specific neuronal nuclei, such as the medial habenula (Fig\u00a03A). Of interest, metastasis\u2010associated Iba1+ microglia/macrophages showed high intensity of HSP90; however, they were outnumbered by HSP90high cancer cells (Fig\u00a03C). Thus, we focus our efforts on the characterization of the drug target in metastatic cells.\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Brain metastases are positive for HSP90\n            \nA\u2013CImmunofluorescence against HSP90 in mouse brains with established metastases.

Black arrows point to cancer cells positive for HSP90 in the nucleus.LQuantification of nuclear HSP90 in human brain metastases. 54 out of 60 samples (90%) showed positive nuclear HSP90 in the tumor. 27 (45%) showed 1\u20135% (moderate) and 27 (45%) showed >\u00a05% (high) of nuclear HSP90.MQuantification of nuclear HSP90 in human primary tumors. 19 out of 30 (63%) showed positive nuclear HSP90 in the tumor. 9 (30%) showed 1\u20135% (moderate) and 10 (33%) showed >\u00a05% (high) of nuclear HSP90.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        60 paraffin\u2010embedded human brain metastases from NSCLC (40 samples) and breast adenocarcinoma (20 samples) were stained with anti\u2010HSP90 by immunohistochemistry and blindly evaluated and scored by a pathologist (Fig\u00a03D, Table\u00a0EV2). 98% of brain metastases were positive for HSP90, with 85% of them showing moderate or strong staining of the protein (score \u2265\u00a02, HSP90high) (Fig\u00a03E and F), which is a value higher than previous reports on primary tumors (Pick et\u00a0al, 2007; Gallegos Ruiz et\u00a0al, 2008; Kim et\u00a0al, 2019). To investigate this possibility, we scored 30 matched primary tumors (Fig\u00a03G) and confirmed a lower percentage (54%) of samples scoring as HSP90high in comparison to brain metastases (Fig\u00a03H). When comparing matched pairs of a primary tumor and a brain metastasis, 13/30 (43%) brain metastases had increased HSP90 levels compared to the primary tumor, from which 10/13 (77%) switched from HSP90low (score \u2264\u00a01) to HSP90high (score \u2265\u00a02). 12/30 (40%) matched pairs showed equal HSP90 levels; however, 8/12 (67%) cases were HSP90high in the primary tumor to start with. Out of the 5/30 (17%) brain metastases with lower HSP90 than the corresponding primary tumor, 3/5 (60%) cases still remained within the HSP90high category and only 2/5 (40%) switched from HSP90high to HSP90low (Fig\u00a03I).\n        Although HSP90 is primarily a cytoplasmic protein, several studies have described its role in nuclear events such as transcriptional processes, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage (Trepel et\u00a0al, 2010; Antonova et\u00a0al, 2019). Moreover, increased nuclear HSP90 correlated positively with poor survival and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients (Su et\u00a0al, 2016). Interestingly, we found nuclear staining of HSP90 in 90% of brain metastasis samples (Fig\u00a03J\u2013L), with 45% of them scoring as HSP90high (>\u00a05% of positive nuclei out of total tumor) according to a previously described criteria (Su et\u00a0al, 2016) (Fig\u00a03L). Similar to the previous analysis, we found fewer primary tumors (63%) positive for nuclear HSP90, with 33% of them scoring HSP90high (Fig\u00a03M). Nevertheless, due to the prevalent low percentage of positive nuclei observed in most samples (Fig\u00a03J), we were not able to accurately assess a potential enrichment of nuclear HSP90 in brain metastases compared to their paired primary tumor.\n        Taken together, our results demonstrate that high levels of HSP90 in cancer cells are a frequent finding among human brain metastasis independently of the primary tumor. Indeed, a clear tendency to maintain or further increase the levels of this protein is evident when compared to matched primary tumors. Overall, these results support potential functional implications of HSP90 in human brain metastasis.\nInhibition of HSP90 is effective to treat established brain metastasis\n        We used DEBIO\u20100932 in preclinical models to study whether the results obtained with METPlatform could be translated in\u00a0vivo.\n        Brain metastases were induced by intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM cells (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009). Two weeks after injection, we confirmed the presence of established metastases in the brain using BLI, histology, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig\u00a04A). DEBIO\u20100932 administration at 160\u00a0mg/kg during the following 3\u00a0weeks significantly impaired the growth of both brain metastases and extracranial lesions (Figs\u00a04B\u2013G and EV2F\u2013H) by targeting HSP90 in cancer cells (Fig\u00a0EV2A\u2013D; Bagatell et\u00a0al, 2000). We did not observe similar effects of DEBIO\u20100932 in the microenvironment (Fig\u00a0EV2E). These results were confirmed by brain and thorax ex\u00a0vivo BLI (Figs\u00a04B and EV2G and H) as well as histological quantification of dissected brains at the endpoint of the experiment, 5\u00a0weeks after cancer cell inoculation, including a reduction of metastases (Fig\u00a04E and F) with an increased in cancer cell death (Fig\u00a04E and G). Of note, we did not observe significant weight loss (Fig\u00a0EV2I), food intake (Fig\u00a0EV2J), or any other sign of toxicity after detailed multi\u2010organ histological analysis by an expert pathologist (Fig\u00a0EV2K) in treated animals compared to the control group, ruling out major toxicities of DEBIO\u20100932. Indeed, DEBIO\u20100932 monotherapy increased survival of treated mice (Fig\u00a0EV2L). However, rather than overinterpreting this significant but limited survival benefit, we use it as an added value reinforcing the need for further characterization of this therapeutic strategy derived from METPlatform. In this sense, treatment of established melanoma brain metastases (Fig\u00a0EV2N) in an immunocompetent background (Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) with DEBIO\u20100932 confirmed the anti\u2010metastatic phenotype (Fig\u00a0EV2M\u2013P).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            Inhibition of HSP90 is effective to treat established brain metastasis\n            \nSchema of the experimental design.

Although all but one BrM\u2010PDOC responded to high dose of DEBIO\u20100932 (Fig\u00a04I and J), decreasing the dose to levels compatible to those detected in mouse brains with metastases (Fig\u00a01J) correlated with the emergence of heterogeneity (Fig\u00a04J). The origin of such heterogeneous therapeutic response did not correlate with similar changes in the microenvironment (Fig\u00a04I) or any particular tumor origin (Fig\u00a04J). Indeed, although 9/19 BrM\u2010PDOC were not compatible with testing two doses due to limited sample availability, only 20% of those receiving them showed divergent responses between high and low DEBIO\u20100932 concentrations (Fig\u00a04K), suggesting that inter\u2010patient differences are more likely to explain this phenotype. Overall, 74% of BrM\u2010PDOC are sensitive to DEBIO\u20100932. In order to get to know the underlying molecular biomarker of HSP90 sensitivity and given that clinical response to HSP90 inhibitors has been attributed to \u201caddiction\u201d of tumors to particular oncogenes, such as HER2, ALK, ROS1, EGFR, and BRAF, which are sensitive HSP90 client proteins (Neckers & Workman, 2012), we had access to such information for a limited number of samples (10/19 samples). Among five brain metastases from NSCLC, two of them harbored a mutation/deletion in EGFR as detected by targeted sequencing (Fig\u00a0EV2R); however, no molecular alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 were found in the other three patients using standard methodologies approved in clinical practice for these biomarkers (Fig\u00a0EV2Q). Additional molecular classifiers included three brain metastases derived from HER2+ breast adenocarcinomas, one from a melanoma with the activating mutation BRAF V600E (Fig\u00a0EV2R), and one from a gastro\u2010esophageal cancer without known oncogenic drivers sensitive to HSP90 inhibition (Fig\u00a0EV2S).\n        These results validate METPlatform as an effective ex\u00a0vivo drug\u2010screening strategy for the identification of brain metastasis vulnerabilities, such as HSP90, that could be translated to in\u00a0vivo metastasis assays. Our results also show that METPlatform could be used to validate experimental therapeutic strategies in human samples, where DEBIO\u20100932 impairs the viability of the majority of BrM\u2010PDOC although with different response rates and independently of their primary tumor origin and established HSP90\u2010dependent oncogenes routinely scored in the clinical practice.\nInhibition of HSP90 prevents brain metastasis initiation as well as local relapse post\u2010surgery\n        Approximately 20\u201340% of patients with brain metastasis receive neurosurgery. However, local relapse occurs in 60% of patients within one year after surgery and limits the benefits of an otherwise successful local therapy (Nahed et\u00a0al, 2019; Dankner et\u00a0al, 2021). To investigate whether DEBIO\u20100932 is able to prevent this clinically relevant situation for which there is no established standard of care, we developed a first\u2010in\u2010class preclinical model of local relapse after brain metastasis neurosurgery.\n        We modelled single brain macrometastasis by intracranial implantation of H2030\u2010BrM cells. This strategy facilitates the surgical approach avoiding non\u2010operable brains with multiple secondary tumors or surgically non\u2010accessible locations of metastasis (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2020). Microsurgical resection of the metastasis guided by GFP was performed when BLI values reached 107\u00a0photons/s/cm\u00b2/steradian (Fig\u00a05A, B, G and I). Successful resection of the bulk tumor was confirmed in real time by the absence of macroscopically detectable GFP+ cancer cells and almost complete postsurgical reduction of BLI in\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a05A, B and D), which doubled the survival time compared to those animals without local treatment (Fig\u00a05C). However, the presence of single cancer cells left behind was also evident by microscopic analysis of the borders of the surgical bed one day after completing the local treatment (Fig\u00a05D). These cancer cells are presumably responsible for the local relapse affecting all treated mice as tumors always reappeared within the same area where mass debulking was initially applied (Fig\u00a05D and H). Full development of relapsed tumors occurred 5\u20136\u00a0weeks after surgery (Fig\u00a05H and I).\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Inhibition of HSP90 prevents brain metastasis initiation as well as local relapse post\u2010surgery\n            \nDetailed image of the neurosurgery procedure that visualizes the GFP+ brain tumor (high magnification) with a 480\u00a0nm light source and goggles equipped with emission filters.

In contrast, we validated that HSP90 coding genes and members of the heat shock response pathway were unaltered in relapsed tumors (Fig\u00a05F, Table\u00a0EV10).\n        Tumor reinitiation after surgery may involve similar mechanisms to those processes necessary during the early stages of brain colonization. Based on our data proving that DEBIO\u20100932 effectively targets the early stages of metastasis ex\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a01E\u2013G) and that HSP90\u2010related genes are equally represented in relapsed metastases (Fig\u00a05F), we hypothesized that DEBIO\u20100932 could be used to prevent relapse. First, we validated the efficacy of DEBIO\u20100932 to prevent metastasis initiation in\u00a0vivo (Fig\u00a0EV3A\u2013G, Table\u00a0EV10) using H2030\u2010BrM as a model following an angio\u2010co\u2010optive growth pattern during metastasis initiation (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014). Subsequently, we used the HSP90 inhibitor in an adjuvant setting after neurosurgery. Although DEBIO\u20100932 administration at 160\u00a0mg/kg starting 3\u00a0days after surgery debuted with an initial impact limiting weight gain in mice, probably reflecting a more vulnerable health state post\u2010surgery, individualized systemic therapy (Fig\u00a0EV3H) stabilized treated mice and delayed local relapse (Fig\u00a05G\u2013I). Remarkably, the percentage of mice surviving above the median increased to 82% with three animals showing at least a 20% extension in overall survival, one of them with stable disease over 18\u00a0weeks (Fig\u00a0EV3I). However, survival benefits experienced by this arm did not reach statistical significance (Fig\u00a0EV3I). Nonetheless, mice treated with adjuvant anti\u2010HSP90 therapy experienced a less aggressive relapse as measured by the reduced systemic impact (i.e., weight loss) of uncontrolled tumor growth in the brain (Fig\u00a05J).\n        \n          Figure EV3\n          \n            Inhibition of HSP90 prevents brain metastasis initiation as well as local relapse post\u2010surgery\n            \nARepresentative images of mice treated with DEBIO\u20100932 (160\u00a0mg/kg, o.g.) starting at 7\u00a0days after intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM cells.

Slides were stained for 5\u00a0min in hematoxylin solution and 30\u00a0s in eosin solution, and were left unmounted. Fully established brain metastases were isolated using the ArcturusXT\u2122 Laser Capture Microdissection System (Thermo Scientific) and Arcturus\u00ae CapSure\u00ae Macro LCM Caps (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each dissection was validated by inspection of the cap and the sample. At least 12 brain metastases per biological sample were dissected. Dissected samples were processed using the commercially available in\u2010StageTip\u2010NHS kit (PreOmics GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Peptides were dissolved in HPLC\u2010grade water containing 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile. Randomization for sample run order was applied and the samples were individually analyzed using shot\u2010gun liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS) on a high accuracy Orbitrap Fusion\u2122 Lumos\u2122 Tribrid\u2122 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) coupled to an Acquity M nanoflow system (Waters GmbH). Samples were analyzed using 120\u00a0min gradient, top12 loop count, mass range 350\u20131,500\u00a0m/z, and an Acquity UPLC\u00ae M class 250\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a075\u00a0\u00b5M column. All raw files from LC\u2010MS/MS were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.6) using the standard settings against a human protein database (UniProtKB/Swiss\u2010Prot, 20,373 sequences) supplemented with contaminants. Label\u2010free quantification was done with match between runs (match window of 0.7\u00a0min and alignment window of 20\u00a0min). Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation of methionines and protein N\u2010term acetylation as variable modifications. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two tryptic missed\u2010cleavages were allowed. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020092. Results were filtered at 0.01 FDR (peptide and protein level). Then, the \u201cproteinGroups.txt\u201d file was loaded in Prostar (v1.14) (Wieczorek et\u00a0al, 2017) for further statistical analysis. Briefly, global normalization across samples was performed using the LOESS function and missing values were imputed using the algorithms slsa (for partially observed values) and detquantile (for values missing on an entire condition). Differential analysis was done using the empirical bayes statistics limma. Proteins with a P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and a log2 ratio >\u00a01 or <\u00a0\u22121 were defined as deregulated. The FDR was estimated to be 14% by Benjamini\u2010Hochberg. Functional analysis was performed with the GSEApreranked function (biocarta, canonical pathways, GO, KEGG, OncogenicSignatures, Reactome, TFs) using the log2 ratios as the input file to identify top 25 upregulated and downregulated signatures defined by NES values, FDR\u00a0<\u00a025% and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01.\nMETPlatform facilitates unbiased identification of synergistic drug combinations against brain metastasis\n        Despite the encouraging pharmacological results obtained with DEBIO\u20100932 in\u00a0vivo (Figs\u00a04B\u2013G, EV2M\u2013P, 5G\u2013I, EV3A\u2013F), control of metastatic disease could still be improved (Figs\u00a0EV2L, EV2O, EV3G, and EV3I). Additionally, synergistic drug combinations are aimed to maximize sensitivity over tumor cells while minimizing toxicity in normal cells, which has been a limiting factor for the use of HSP90 inhibitors in patients (Neckers & Workman, 2012).\n        Our proteomic analysis on DEBIO\u20100932 treatment identified the upregulation of multiple signatures representing adhesion, migration, and interaction with the matrix as well as increased lysosome activity (Fig\u00a06D, Appendix\u00a0Fig S2, Table\u00a0EV4), all of which are known mechanisms involved in therapeutic resistance (Sui et\u00a0al, 2013; Orgaz et\u00a0al, 2020). Given that lysosome activity is tightly linked to autophagy (Sui et\u00a0al, 2013) and previous studies reported the induction of autophagy by HSP90 inhibitors in cancer (Liu et\u00a0al, 2012; Samarasinghe et\u00a0al, 2014; Mori et\u00a0al, 2015; He et\u00a0al, 2016; Zhao et\u00a0al, 2019), we decided to explore this process as a potential actionable resistance mechanism to HSP90 inhibition in brain metastasis. In addition to the upregulation of the autophagy\u2010related protein ATG7 (Levy et\u00a0al, 2017) (Fig\u00a06C), we noticed that the early response of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition induced the accumulation of the adaptor protein p62 or sequestosome\u20101 (Fig\u00a07A and B). As an additional evidence of the molecular crosstalk between HSP90 and autophagy in brain metastasis, we used a probe that labels the flux of lysosomal degradation based on GFP\u2010tagged LC3 (Kaizuka et\u00a0al, 2016). Given the unavailability of H2030\u2010BrM or MDA231\u2010BrM cell lines lacking the GFP reporter (Bos et\u00a0al, 2009; Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009; Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Chen et\u00a0al, 2016; Valiente, 2020) and that DEBIO\u20100932 efficacy on brain metastasis is independent of the primary source (Figs\u00a01D, EV1B, EV1G, Table\u00a0EV1, Figs\u00a04J, EV2 O and P), we used the reporter\u2010free melanoma brain metastatic cell line B16/F10\u2010BrM (Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) for this purpose (Fig\u00a07C). Treatment of B16/F10\u2010BrM organotypic brain cultures with DEBIO\u20100932 decreased the amount of GFP\u2010LC3+ vesicles, which indicates enhanced autophagic flux (Fig\u00a07D and E). Of note, the same probe also encodes an autophagy\u2010independent RFP reporter, which does not change in the presence of DEBIO\u20100932 (Fig\u00a07D). Based on the above findings indicating increased autophagy upon DEBIO\u20100932 treatment, we combined it with the broadly used autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Mauvezin et\u00a0al, 2015). Combined therapy with both inhibitors in established lung adenocarcinoma H2030\u2010BrM brain metastases ex\u00a0vivo showed synergistic effects compared to sublethal concentration of DEBIO\u20100932 (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3). However, bafilomycin A1 did not progress to clinical development due to its poor toxicity profile in\u00a0vivo causing disturbances in locomotor control and convulsions (Keeling et\u00a0al, 1997; DeVorkin & Lum, 2014). Therefore, we looked for alternative compounds able to block autophagy and superior ability to cross the BBB. The FDA\u2010approved anti\u2010psychotic drug chlorpromazine fulfills these two requirements (Fig\u00a07G) (Nadanaciva et\u00a0al, 2011). As predicted based on our findings, the combination of sublethal concentration of DEBIO\u20100932 with the CNS\u2010related drug chlorpromazine (Fig\u00a07F) was effective against H2030\u2010BrM (Fig\u00a07H) as well as B16/F10\u2010BrM (Fig\u00a07I) brain metastases ex\u00a0vivo. However, translation of this combination therapy in\u00a0vivo has not been successful (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3G) potentially derived from the secondary effects (i.e., long\u2010term drowsiness accompanied with weight loss) (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3C and D) of chlorpromazine at the dose required to detect brain levels (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3I) and its negative impact, even at lower concentration used (5\u00a0mg/kg) on decreasing the accumulation of DEBIO\u20100932 in the brain (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3H). In an effort to evaluate an alternative member of the same class of autophagy inhibitors, trifluoperazine was used (Xia et\u00a0al, 2021). However, similar in\u00a0vivo findings emerged including the need to limit its dose because of toxic effects when combined (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3E and F) as well as a similar dramatic reduction of DEBIO\u20100932 accumulation in the brain (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3H). In this case, even though the dose of trifluoperazine had to be reduced early on (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3E and F), the compound was still detected in the brain (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3J).\n        \n          Figure 7\n          \n            METPlatform facilitates unbiased identification of synergistic drug combinations against brain metastasis\n            \nSchema of experimental design.

METPlatform is a valuable tool for metastasis research that integrates drug\u2010screening and omic approaches to study pharmacological and biological vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that one vulnerability corresponds to the dependency on HSP90. The BBB\u2010permeable HSP90 inhibitor DEBIO\u20100932 is an effective therapeutic strategy against established brain metastasis and the analysis of such phenotype with in\u00a0situ proteomics revealed potential novel mediators of brain metastasis downstream HSP90. At the same time, autophagy appears as an actionable mechanism of resistance upon HSP90 inhibition, allowing design of rationale combinations using autophagy inhibitors and DEBIO\u20100932 to target brain metastasis more effectively if appropriate drugs could be combined in\u00a0vivo.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        Thus, the use of METPlatform to identify combination strategies that could be more effective against metastasis also involves its limitation to predict crucial pharmacokinetic aspects at the organismal level. Consequently, METPlatform must be conceived as a strategy to facilitate the initial testing of novel concepts for drug repurposing (i.e., the use of an anti\u2010psychotic drug to compromise brain metastasis) (Fig\u00a07J), favoring the reduction of the use of animal models rather than the replacement of in\u00a0vivo validation, a crucial step to define the viability of a therapeutic strategy.\nMETPlatform as a clinically compatible \u201cavatar\u201d\n        A major benefit of METPlatform would derive from its use as a strategy for personalized medicine, for instance by providing a fast readout on the efficacy of postsurgical adjuvant treatments. To evaluate PDOC as ex\u00a0vivo \u201cavatars\u201d of cancer patients, we performed a proof\u2010of\u2010concept substantiation with glioblastoma (GB) diagnosed de novo. In contrast to the lack of standard of care after neurosurgery in patients with brain metastasis, those with GB invariably receive radiotherapy plus temozolomide (Fig\u00a08A) (Stupp et\u00a0al, 2005, 2009). We initially tested the combination of radiation and temozolomide in 17 glioblastoma patient\u2010derived organotypic cultures (GB\u2010PDOC) to demonstrate the existence of responders (R) (Fig\u00a0EV5B) and non\u2010responders (NR) (Fig\u00a0EV5C) to the standard of care, as well as the consistency of such category (R vs. NR) in a broad concentration range of the alkylating agent (Fig\u00a0EV5A\u2013D, Table\u00a0EV10). Additionally, we confirmed that the decrease in proliferation (Fig\u00a0EV5B) matched the sustained induction of DNA damage upon treatment (Fig\u00a0EV5E and F), thus confirming this readout to asses therapeutic response to the combination therapy, as previously reported (Oldrini et\u00a0al, 2020). Finally, we evaluated that GB\u2010PDOC did not experience a different degree of compromised viability compared to our previous results (Fig\u00a02D, Appendix\u00a0Fig S1) with this unspecific assay (Fig\u00a0EV5G).\n        \n          Figure 8\n          \n            METPlatform as a clinically compatible \u201cavatar\u201d\n            \nSchema of experimental design using GB\u2010PDOC.Correlation between response in GB\u2010PDOC (left side of the graph) and its respective patient (right side of the graph).

P value was calculated using two\u2010tailed t\u2010test.GQuantification of LDH levels in the conditioned media of organotypic slices cultured during 3 and 7\u00a0days relative to a lysate of the same GB\u2010PDOC.

LDH levels at 7\u00a0days measure the accumulation of the enzyme in the media from day 3 on.H\nPost hoc quantification of the ratio between the number of months with stable disease in each patient (at cut off September 2021) and the corresponding % of proliferation after GB\u2010PDOC treatment in METPlatform. The dotted line indicates the median. Each dot corresponds to a patient. Green dots: patient with stable disease; white dots: patients with progressive disease. The red line labels those patients with a reduction above 40% in cancer cell proliferation in the corresponding GB\u2010PDOC.\n\n          \n          \n        \n        In order to evaluate whether GB\u2010PDOC recapitulate patient response to radiotherapy and temozolomide, we compared the response of fourteen GB\u2010PDOC treated with the standard of care during seven days with the clinical response of matched patients at initial MRI post\u2010therapy. In addition, we evaluated the MGMT methylation status, an established predictive biomarker of response to this therapy (Hegi et\u00a0al, 2005; Stupp et\u00a0al, 2005, 2009) (Fig\u00a08A and B, Table\u00a0EV6). GB\u2010PDOC showing cancer cell proliferation under 40% as compared to the corresponding untreated PDOC from the same patient were considered responders (Fig\u00a08B). At data cutoff in September 2021, all patients had been evaluated for response to the standard of care and were classified as progressive (non\u2010responder, NR) or stable disease (responder, R), with the last ones showing ongoing response at time of cutoff (Fig\u00a08B, Table\u00a0EV9). Remarkably, GB\u2010PDOC predicted clinical response of their respective patient in 86% of the cases (Fig\u00a08B\u2013D, Table\u00a0EV9). In contrast, MGMT methylation status correlated with patient response in 50% of the cases (Fig\u00a08B and D, Table\u00a0EV9). Post hoc data analysis at cutoff defined that a ratio above 0.2 between the time of sustained patient response and the percentage of proliferation in treated GB\u2010PDOC defined the category of stable disease in 87% of the patients (7/8 patients with stable disease) (Fig\u00a0EV5H, Table\u00a0EV9). Interestingly, 86% (6/7) of the patients with a ratio above 0.2 have less than 40% of proliferative cancer cells in their matched GB\u2010PDOC (Fig\u00a0EV5H, Table\u00a0EV9), confirming its relevance to define response or lack of thereof in this cohort of patients.\n        Consequently, this preliminary finding suggests that METPlatform might have potential predictive value as a clinically compatible patient \u201cavatar\u201d. However, in order to conclude about METPlatform as a realistic strategy to improve personalized cancer care the current limited data must be significantly expanded to additional clinical cohorts.\nDiscussion\n      The novel drug\u2010screening platform we report here (METPlatform) allows identification of pharmacological vulnerabilities of metastasis in\u00a0situ using an ex\u00a0vivo setting. Organotypic cultures is a well\u2010established technique that could be applied to many different organs (Shamir & Ewald, 2014; Humpel, 2015) and has been reported by us and others to maintain the specific tissue architecture and cellular composition when applied to metastasis (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Er et\u00a0al, 2018; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018; Zhu & Valiente, 2021). Although organotypic cultures do have important limitations as an experimental drug\u2010screening platform for metastasis since they do not mimic the whole metastatic cascade, do not have the ability to score whether a compound crosses a vascular barrier such as the BBB or blood\u2013tumor barrier (BTB) in the brain, and do not provide PK/PD information besides the organ under evaluation, this strategy is still highly versatile compared to other methods. For instance, METPlatform is able to resemble different stages of organ colonization and allows evaluating the impact of drugs on the non\u2010cancer compartment, and it is compatible with omic approaches, therefore providing a unique tool for basic and translational metastasis research.\n      The exclusion of patients with brain metastasis from clinical trials together with the limited information on the ability of drugs to cross the BBB or BTB constitute a vicious cycle that decelerates the development of new therapeutic opportunities for patients with brain metastases. METPlatform might be a valid strategy to challenge this situation by providing a relevant tissue context where drugs never used for brain metastases could be easily tested and, if appropriate, prioritized for further in\u00a0vivo validation.\n      The unique ability of METPlatform to identify hits scoring ex\u00a0vivo but not in\u00a0vitro is of particular interest since their targets (HSP90, MEK1/2, CDKs, RAF1, BRAF, VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, DNA\u2010PK, PI3K, ATR, c\u2010Kit) might be key during organ colonization. Adaptation of cancer cells to a new organ involves molecular changes in the transcriptome, metabolome, or proteome (Park et\u00a0al, 2011; Sevenich et\u00a0al, 2014; Basnet et\u00a0al, 2019). These changes occurring in\u00a0situ (i.e., metastatic cells colonizing the brain) could underlie the induction of a drug target or the activation of a resistance mechanism (Chen et\u00a0al, 2016). Even more, METPlatform allows to uncover specific molecular vulnerabilities of the different compartments within the biology of organ colonization. For instance, inhibitors that are only effective at advanced stages of the disease might reflect the remodeling of the na\u00efve microenvironment into a protumoral niche (Sevenich et\u00a0al, 2014; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018) where drug targets could be also present within the non\u2010cancer compartment (i.e., pazopanib, #110) (Gril et\u00a0al, 2013).\n      To validate the vulnerabilities identified by METPlatform, we proved the dependency of brain metastasis on HSP90 signaling in\u00a0vivo. Although the association of high HSP90 levels with systemic disease in cancer has been broadly reported (Pick et\u00a0al, 2007; Gallegos Ruiz et\u00a0al, 2008; McCarthy et\u00a0al, 2008; Su et\u00a0al, 2016; Dimas et\u00a0al, 2018), whether this association involves any specific step of the metastatic cascade had not been addressed. We demonstrate that the last step of metastasis, organ colonization, is sensitive to HSP90 inhibition, either during the initial stages as well as once metastases are established. Interestingly, we identified HSP90\u2010dependent proteins AHR, DDA1 UBE4B, and GPATCH8, which share the ability to translocate to the nucleus (Murray et\u00a0al, 2014; Du et\u00a0al, 2016; Cheng et\u00a0al, 2017), as functionally relevant in brain metastasis and/or present in patient samples from a variety of primary tumors. Given the evident heterogeneity among BrM\u2010PDOC regarding their response to DEBIO\u20100932 at low concentrations and the lack of a clear correlation with HSP90\u2010dependent oncogenes, it remains to be determined whether the HSP90 signature could predict the response rate to the drug. All these findings strongly suggest the discovery of a novel molecular program in organ colonization during metastasis, which can be explored therapeutically beyond HSP90 inhibitors (i.e., AHR inhibitor). Although we focused our efforts on brain metastasis, the dependency on HSP90 signaling does not support an organ\u2010specific model as suggested by functional experiments and association with extracranial relapse in patients. In this sense, the identification of Iba1+/HSP90+ tumor\u2010associated microglia/macrophages deserve further research to define whether or not they contribute to metastasis progression and if so whether they do in an organ\u2010dependent manner.\n      DEBIO\u20100932, a second\u2010generation inhibitor of HSP90 with the ability to penetrate the BBB (Bao et\u00a0al, 2009), is currently under evaluation in a Phase I/II study for patients with advanced NSCLC (NCT01714037). Reports on selected patients enrolled in this trial suggest potential benefit in the metastatic setting (Cedr\u00e9s et\u00a0al, 2018). To the best of our knowledge, none of the clinical trials using HSP90 inhibitors includes patients with brain metastases. Therefore, our work provides the rationale and proof\u2010of\u2010principle to include patients with CNS disease in current clinical trials with BBB\u2010permeable HSP90 inhibitors and/or to design a specific one for this patient population in the adjuvant setting after neurosurgery. Of note, although our extensive evaluation of DEBIO\u20100932 regarding its potential toxic effects did not report any major finding, we encourage that specific preclinical analysis taking into account the expression of HSP90 in specific brain neuronal nuclei will take place before any further clinical consideration.\n      The model of local relapse after neurosurgery that we report here represents not only a clear opportunity to translate our findings into a clinically compatible preventive strategy, but also the opportunity to investigate the biology of this process for the first time. Indeed, the molecular characterization performed suggests the provoking hypothesis that cancer cells left behind after a debulking neurosurgery reinitiate metastasis using vascular co\u2010option, a key mechanism during the early times of organ colonization (Garc\u00eda\u2010G\u00f3mez & Valiente, 2020). However, in contrast to the initial colonization of the brain, local relapse post\u2010surgery will require the additional ability of metastasis\u2010initiating cells to cope with a severely damaged microenvironment to regenerate the tumor.\n      The highest potential of METPlatform stands on its clinical compatibility. Patient \u201cavatars\u201d have been exploited using patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDX), patient\u2010derived organoids (PDO) and patient\u2010derived primary cultures (PDC) to test candidate drugs prior to the treatment of the patient, therefore helping to select empirical therapies for the study (Garralda et\u00a0al, 2014; Gao et\u00a0al, 2015; Lee et\u00a0al, 2018; Vlachogiannis et\u00a0al, 2018; Jiang et\u00a0al, 2020). However, these models frequently dissociate from the limited time available in the clinic, involve a significant source of variability and technical requirements to be established, and lack the microenvironment, all of which become important limitations to their translation into a clinical scenario. In this regard, we show the potential of METPlatform to outperform established clinical biomarkers to predict therapeutic response in a clinically compatible time frame when applied to a difficult\u2010to\u2010treat cancer (i.e., glioblastoma).\n      Predicting patient response to a specific treatment is highly desirable in the current context of personalized medicine. METPlatform could be explored to test experimental therapies ex\u00a0vivo, as monotherapies or in combination with the standard of care, in preparation for the potential emergence of resistance in patients. In addition, PDOC that do not respond to the standard of care (ex\u00a0vivo and in the clinic) but are sensitive to a given experimental therapy could be fully characterized with multiomic profiling in the search for novel biomarkers of the identified vulnerabilities. We are confident that METPlatform could contribute to achieve optimal patient stratification toward improved clinical trial design, thus favoring the impact of personalized medicine in Oncology. In particular, we propose to further characterize it on patients at high risk of developing resistance or when no reliable biomarker\u2010driven therapies exist, which are both aspects of especial relevance in metastasis.\nMaterials and Methods\n      \n        Chemicals and reagents\n        An in\u2010house chemical library composed of 114 FDA\u2010approved or in clinical trials anti\u2010tumoral drugs (Bejarano et\u00a0al, 2019) solved in DMSO (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was used for ex\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro screening. For in\u00a0vivo treatment, DEBIO\u20100932 (MedChemExpress) was formulated in 30% captisol (Ligand), chlorpromazine hydrochloride (Abcr) was solved in 0.9% saline solution and trifluoperazine hydrochloride (Merck) was formulated in 12.5% cremophor, 2.5% DMSO, and 85% saline. For ex\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro treatments, DEBIO\u20100932, methotrexate (MedChemExpress), bafilomycin A1 (Selleckchem), chlorpromazine (Sigma\u2010Aldrich), and BAY\u2010218 (Selleckchem) were solved in DMSO. CyQUANT\u2122 LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (C20301, Thermo Fisher) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CyQUANT\u2122 LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (C20301, Thermo Fisher) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n      \n      \n        Animal studies\n        All animal experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the CNIO (IACUC.030\u20102015), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (CBA35_2015\u2010v2), and Comunidad de Madrid Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (PROEX250/15 and PROEX135/19). Females athymic nu/nu (Harlan) or equal proportions of C57BL/6 males and females mice (for the B16/F10\u2010BrM model) 4\u201310\u00a0weeks of age were used. Housing and husbandry conditions are in accredited by AAALAC. Mice are SPF with microbiological and environmental parameters constantly monitored. Brain colonization assays were performed by injecting 100\u00a0\u03bcl PBS into the left ventricle containing 100,000 or 40,000 cancer cells or 2\u00a0\u03bcl RPMI1640 intracranially (the right frontal cortex, approximately 1.5\u00a0mm lateral and 1\u00a0mm caudal flow bregma, and to a depth of 1\u00a0mm) containing 100,000 cancer cells by using a gas\u2010tight Hamilton syringe and a stereotactic apparatus. Brain colonization was analyzed in\u00a0vivo and ex\u00a0vivo by BLI. Anesthetized mice (isoflurane) were injected retro\u2010orbitally with D\u2010luciferin (150\u00a0mg/kg; Syd Labs) and imaged with an IVIS machine (Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence analysis was performed using Living Image software, version 4.5. Brain tumor resection was performed by adapting previously described procedures (Morrissy et\u00a0al, 2016). In brief, after exposing the skull, a craniotomy is performed surrounding the tumor area, which is visualized by GFP, using an excitation light source at 460\u2013495\u00a0nm (FS/ULS\u201002 B2, BLS Ltd) and goggles carrying emission filters (FHS/EF\u20103GY1, BLS Ltd). The skull and the dura are lifted with micro\u2010dissecting forceps, and the bulk of the tumor is then removed using a microcurette guided by GFP. When hemostasis is obtained, the surgical wound is sutured using interrupted stitching with absorbable sutures. Animals receive meloxicam at 5\u00a0mg/kg once per day during 72\u00a0h and dexamethasone at 13\u00a0mg/kg once per day during 48\u00a0h to contain brain edema. DEBIO\u20100932 was administered by oral gavage (160\u00a0mg/kg) for 3\u00a0weeks, daily during the first week and once every 48\u00a0h during the two following weeks, starting 7 or 14\u00a0days after intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM for preventive or interventive therapy, respectively. For preventive therapy of relapse after neurosurgery, DEBIO\u20100932 was administered by oral gavage (160\u00a0mg/kg) for 5\u20136\u00a0weeks, starting 3\u00a0days after neurosurgery. Treatment was given in an individualized regimen according to clinical symptoms of toxicity, including mouse weight, diarrhea, and activity of the animal. For combination therapy of DEBIO\u20100932 with autophagy inhibitors, DEBIO\u20100932 was administered following the interventive setting, and chlorpromazine at 5\u00a0mg/kg or trifluoperazine at 10\u00a0mg/kg was administered daily intraperitoneally for 3\u00a0weeks, starting at 14\u00a0days after intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM cells. For interventive therapy of DEBIO\u20100932 (160\u00a0mg/kg) in B16/F10\u2010BrM tumors, treatment was given daily for 10\u00a0days starting at 3\u00a0days after intracranial inoculation of cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        Organotypic cultures\n        Organotypic cultures from adult mouse brain and liver were prepared as previously described (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014). Brains with established metastases (5\u20137\u00a0weeks after intracardiac inoculation of cancer cells) or without metastases (wild\u2010type) and wild\u2010type livers were used. In brief, organs were dissected in HBSS supplemented with HEPES (pH 7.4, 2.5\u00a0mM), D\u2010glucose (30\u00a0mM), CaCl2 (1\u00a0mM), MgCl2 (1\u00a0mM), and NaHCO3 (4\u00a0mM) and embedded in 4% low\u2010melting agarose (Lonza) preheated at 42\u00b0C. The embedded organs were cut into 250\u2010\u03bcm slices using a vibratome (Leica). Brain slices were divided at the hemisphere into two pieces. Slices were placed with flat spatulas on top of 0.8\u2010\u03bcm pore membranes (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) floating on slice culture media (DMEM, supplemented HBSS, FBS 5%, l\u2010glutamine (1\u00a0mM), and 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin). Brain slices were imaged to confirm the presence of established metastases using BLI (day 0) and were cultured in the presence of the anti\u2010tumoral library at 10\u00a0\u00b5M of each compound. Brain slices were imaged 3\u00a0days after the addition of the inhibitors (day 3). For 7\u00a0days cultures, treatments were replaced at day 3 in fresh media and slices were imaged at day 7. If slices were obtained from wild\u2010type brains, 30,000 cancer cells suspended in 2\u00a0\u03bcl of slice culture media were placed on the surface of the slice and incubated in the presence of the inhibitors for 4\u00a0days. Brain slices were imaged 12\u201316\u00a0h after addition of cells (Day 0) and 3\u00a0days after the first BLI (Day 3). Growth rate was obtained by comparing the fold increases between Day 3/7 and Day 0, and normalized to values obtained from slices cultured with DMSO (100%). The BrdU pulse (0.2\u00a0mg/ml, Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was given by adding it in the media 2\u00a0h (H2030\u2010BrM) or 4\u00a0h (MDA231\u2010BrM) before fixation. Brain slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight and then free\u2010floating immunofluorescence was performed. For proteomic analysis, organotypic cultures with established brain metastases from H2030\u2010BrM were treated with DEBIO\u20100932 at 1\u00a0\u00b5M for 6\u00a0h followed by fixation with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. For analysis of autophagic flux, 200,000 B16/F10\u2010BrM cells with stable expression the autophagy probe GFP\u2010LC3\u2010RFP were added on wild\u2010type brain slices and incubated for 24\u00a0h, followed by DEBIO\u20100932 treatment at 10\u00a0\u00b5M for 12\u00a0h and fixation with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. For evaluation of hepatotoxicity, wild\u2010type liver slices were cultured in the presence of the corresponding inhibitors for 3\u00a0days and fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by free\u2010floating immunofluorescence.\n      \n      \n        Patient\u2010derived organotypic cultures (PDOC)\n        Surgically resected human brain metastases and newly diagnosed glioblastomas were collected in neurobasal media A supplemented with 1 \u00d7 B27 (17504\u2010044, Gibco), 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0N\u20102 (17502\u2010048, Gibco), 25\u00a0ng/ml bFGF (13256029, Gibco), 100\u00a0ng/ml IGF1 (291\u2010G1, R&D Systems), 25\u00a0ng/ml EGF (E9644, Sigma\u2010Aldrich), 10\u00a0ng/ml NRG1\u2010\u03b21/HRG\u2010\u03b21 (396\u2010HB, R&D Systems), 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. Tissue was embedded in 4% low\u2010melting agarose, and 250\u2010\u00b5m slices were obtained using a vibratome. Slices from brain metastases were cultured in the presence of DEBIO\u20100932 at 10\u00a0\u00b5M and 1\u00a0\u00b5M for 3\u00a0days. Slices from glioblastomas were cultured in the presence of temozolomide (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) at 250\u00a0\u00b5M for 8\u00a0days and received 20\u00a0Gy of radiation fractionated in 2 doses of 10\u00a0Gy at days 1 and 4. Temozolomide treatment was replaced at Day 4 in fresh media. A BrdU pulse (4\u00a0h) was given at the end of the experiment followed by fixation of slices with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C and free\u2010floating immunofluorescence. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The experiments are aligned to the principles set out in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and the Department of Health and Human Services Belmont Report. All samples were in compliance with protocols approved by their respective Institutional Review Board (IRB) (CEI.PI.64_2016\u2010v3, CEI PI 25_2020\u2010v2, CEI PI 50_2021).\n      \n      \n        Cell culture\n        Human and mouse BrM cell lines have been previously described and obtained from the same batches that were previously published (Bos et\u00a0al, 2009; Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009; Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018). Cell lines were validated by morphological analysis and their behavior in\u00a0vivo. All cell lines were tested mycoplasma\u2010free. H2030\u2010BrM3 (abbreviated as H2030\u2010BrM) (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC) and PC9\u2010BrM3 (abbreviated as PC9\u2010BrM) (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC) were cultured in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B.

For retrovirus production, HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. For the in\u00a0vitro screening with the anti\u2010tumoral library, H2030\u2010BrM cells were seeded in 96\u2010well microtiter plates at a density of 4,000\u00a0cells/well. Cells were incubated for 24\u00a0h before adding the compounds. Compounds were weighed out and solved in DMSO to a final concentration of 10\u00a0mM. From here, a \u201cmother plate\u201d with serial dilutions was prepared at 100\u00d7 the final concentration in the culture. The final concentration of DMSO in the tissue culture media should not exceed 1%. 2\u00a0\u00b5l of the compounds were added automatically (Beckman FX 96 tip) to 200\u00a0\u00b5l media to make it up to the final concentration for each drug. Each concentration was assayed in duplicate. Cells were exposed to the compounds for 72\u00a0h and then processed for CellTiter\u2010Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) readout according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and read on EndVision (Perkin Elmer). Proliferation rate (%) was calculated by normalizing luminescent values obtained for each compound to values obtained with DMSO (100%). For oncosphere generation, 1,000 H2030\u2010BrM cells were plated in low\u2010attachment plates in Humec medium (12753018, Gibco) supplemented with 1\u00d7 B27, 10\u00a0ng/ml bFGF, 20\u00a0ng/ml EGF, and 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml insulin solution from bovine pancreas (IGF1; I0516, Sigma\u2010Aldrich). Cells were grown for 14\u00a0days until oncospheres were formed, followed by treatment compounds from the anti\u2010tumoral library for 3\u00a0days. Growth rate was obtained by comparing the fold increases in BLI between Day 3 and Day 0, and normalized to values obtained from oncospheres cultured with DMSO (100%).\n      \n      \n        Virus production\n        For lentivirus production, HEK293T cells at 70% confluence were transfected in Opti\u2010MEM with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight with 8.75\u00a0\u00b5g of the following plasmids: pMDLg/pRRE (#12251, Addgene), pRSV\u2010Rev (#12253, Addgene), VSV.G (#14888, Addgene), and lentiviral vectors carrying the corresponding shRNA against human AHR (sh#1: clone ID TRC21258, ATTAAGTCGGTCTCTATGCCG; sh#2: clone ID TRC21254, AAGACATTATATTGTTGTGGG; Horizon Discovery), human UBE4B (sh#1: clone ID TRC7546, TTAAAGGCAGTGTTATATCGG; sh#2: clone ID TRC7548, TATTGTGGATTTGATCCCTGC; Horizon Discovery), human DDA1 (sh#1: clone ID TRC142338, TCACGATGATCTGTTCAGACG; Horizon Discovery), or non\u2010targeting control. For retrovirus production, HEK293T cells at 70% confluence were transfected with 10\u00a0\u00b5g of pMRX\u2010IP\u2010GFP\u2010LC3\u2010RFP (#84573, Addgene), 5\u00a0\u00b5g of VSV.G (#14888, Addgene), and 5\u00a0\u00b5g pCL\u2010Eco (#12371, Addgene) in Opti\u2010MEM with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h. For both types of viruses, media was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine and virus production was maintained for 48\u00a0h. Viral supernatant was collected, passed through a 0.45\u2010\u00b5m syringe filter and added to the corresponding cells (lentivirus to H2030\u2010BrM and retrovirus to B16/F10\u2010BrM) at 50% confluence in RPMI1640 (H2030\u2010BrM) or DMEM (B16/F10\u2010BrM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, and polybrene (5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, Sigma\u2010Aldrich). The following day, media was replaced with the respective culture media. Selection with puromycin (2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was started 48\u00a0h after and maintained until complete cell death was observed in the non\u2010infected cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        Clinical samples and immunohistochemistry\n        Sixty brain metastases from lung cancer (40 cases) and breast cancer (20 cases) and thirty matched primary tumors (28 lung tumors and 2 breast tumors) were obtained from University Hospital of Turin to assess HSP90 levels. Twenty\u2010two brain metastases were obtained from Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre to evaluate UBE4B, AHR, ALK, ROS1, HER2, and BRAFV600E status. All samples followed protocols approved by the corresponding IRB (1\u201018\u201001/2016 and CEI.PI.64_2016\u2010v3) and the Biobank of the hospital, respectively. Immunohistochemistry against HSP90, DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR was performed at the CNIO Histopathology Core Facility using a standardized automated protocol (Ventana Discovery XT, Roche for HSP90; AS Link, Dako, Agilent for DDA1, UBE4B and AHR). All reagents, with exception of the primary antibodies, were purchased from Roche and Agilent. For HSP90, antigen retrieval was performed using cell conditioning solution (CC1 mild), followed by endogenous peroxides blocking with inhibitor CM. Antigen retrieval was performed with high pH buffer for AHR and low pH buffer for DDA1 and UBE4B, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with peroxide hydrogen at 3%. Slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies as follows: HSP90\u03b1/\u03b2 (clone F\u20108, 1:3,000; sc\u201013119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 8\u00a0min), DDA1 (1:2,400; 14995\u20101\u2010AP, ProteinTech), UBE4B (1:500; ab97697, Abcam) and AHR (1:400; 031714, USBiologicals Life Sciences). After the primary antibody, slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualization systems (OmniMap for HSP90 and EnVision FLEX\u00a0+\u00a0Rabbit Linker for DDA1, UBE4B, and AHR) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunohistochemical reaction was developed using ChromoMap DAB kit. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium for microscopic evaluation. Positive control sections known to be primary antibody positive were included for each staining run. Immunostains were blindly evaluated and scored by a pathologist. Intensity of the staining was evaluated and a representative score (the score covering the largest tumor area) was assigned to each sample. Percentage of cancer cells positive for cytoplasmic HSP90 over total tumor area was quantified. Nuclear HSP90 was scored by quantifying percentage of cancer cells positive for nuclear HSP90 normalized to total tumor. Immunohistochemistry against ALK, ROS1, HER2, and BRAFV600E was performed on 4\u2010\u00b5m\u2010thick sections of formalin\u2010fixed and paraffin\u2010embedded brain samples at Hospital 12 de Octubre. For immunostaining against ROS1 and BRAFV600E, a standardized automated protocol using the Leica Bond Polymer Refining Kit (Leica Bond\u2010III stainer, Leica Biosystems) was performed. Antigen retrieval was performed using 30\u00b4 EDTA, pH 9.0, followed by endogenous peroxides blocking with hydrogen peroxide. Slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (ROS1, 1:200; mAb3287, Cell Signaling; anti\u2010BRAFV600E clone VE1, 1:50; E19294, Spring Bioscience). For immunostaining against ALK, a standardized automated protocol using the OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit (BenchMark GT automated immunostainer, Ventana, Roche) was performed. Antigen retrieval was performed using CC1 92\u00b4, followed by endogenous peroxides blocking. Slides were incubated with the primary antibody (anti\u2010ALK clone D5F3, prediluted; 790\u20134794, Ventana). After the primary antibodies, slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualization systems (OptiView DAB for ALK and Leica Bond Polymer Refining Kit for ROS1 and BRAF) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunohistochemical reaction was developed using DAB. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium for microscopic evaluation. For immunostaining against HER2, the Bond Oracle HER2 IHC System (Leica Biosystems) was used.\n        Samples used to evaluate the correlation of DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR with relapse belong to two patient cohorts analyzed. All cohorts were composed by women with a diagnosis of primary, non\u2010metastatic breast cancer with expression of estrogen and/or progestogen receptor >\u00a01% and lack of HER2 amplification at Hospital 12 de Octubre. Cohort #1 aimed to analyze the impact of DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR protein levels in the relapse risk. Thus, it was constituted by all the hormone\u2010positive consecutive patients diagnosed in that hospital in 2001 (N\u00a0=\u00a0251) in order to ensure long follow\u2010up. The second cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a011) of cases that showed distant relapse was collected to investigate potential up\u2010 or down\u2010regulation of DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR from the primary to the metastatic lesion; thus, pairs of primary tumor plus their metastases of hormone\u2010positive breast cancers, regardless of the status of traditional prognostic factors were gathered just on the basis of availability of biopsy from the metastatic setting. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hospital 12 de Octubre (Ref: 11/137) and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Processing of these breast cancer tissues for routine histological analysis was fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA) and embedded in paraffin. Tissue microarrays were mounted with two 1\u2010mm cores per sample (Quick\u2010Ray Instruments, UNITMA). An expert pathologist examined a template H&E slide from each sample to select the areas for core selection. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 2.5\u2010\u03bcm TMA sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an automated protocol developed for the Autostainer Link automated slide staining system (DAKO, Agilent) as described above. Corresponding TMA was acquired and digitalized using the AxioScan.Z1 system (Zeiss). Digitalized images were automatically analyzed with the ZEN 2.3 lite software (Zeiss). For staining quartile determination, H\u2010scores were calculated by formula: ((% of Area High Intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03)\u00a0+\u00a0(% of Area Medium Intensity \u00d7 2)\u00a0+\u00a0(% of Area Low Intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01))/100.\n      \n      \n        Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry\n        Tissue for immunofluorescence was obtained after overnight fixation with 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C. Slicing of the brain was done by using a vibratome (Leica) or sliding microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Both types of brain slices (250\u00a0\u03bcm and 80\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively) were blocked in 10% NGS, 2% BSA, and 0.25% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 2\u00a0h at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the blocking solution and the following day for 30\u00a0min at RT. After extensive washing in PBS\u2010Triton 0.25%, the secondary antibody was added in the blocking solution and incubated for 2\u00a0h. After extensive washing in PBS\u2010Triton 0.25%, nuclei were stained with bisbenzamide (1\u00a0mg/ml; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) for 7\u00a0min at RT. Brain slices were pretreated with methanol for 20\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0C before the blocking step for nuclear staining against DDA1 and p\u2010Histone H2A.X (Ser139). For staining against BrdU, mouse brain slices or PDOC were treated with HCI 2N 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 0.1\u00a0M borate buffer (pH 8.5) incubation for 10\u00a0min at RT. After extensive washing in TBS, slices were blocked in 3% NGS in TBS\u2010Triton 0.25% for 1\u00a0h at RT and primary antibody was incubated for 72\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. After extensive washing with TBS\u2010Triton 0.25%, the secondary antibody was incubated in blocking solution for 2\u00a0h at RT followed by extensive washing with TBS. Primary antibodies: GFP (1:1,000; GFP\u20101020, Aves Labs), BrdU (1:500; ab6326, Abcam), Ki67 (1:500; ab15580, Abcam), Cleaved Caspase\u20103 (Asp175) (1:500; #9661, Cell Signaling), HSP90\u03b1/\u03b2 F\u20108 (1:500; sc\u201013119; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HSP70/ HSC70 W27 (1:500; sc\u201024; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AHR (1:300; 31.714.200, US Biological), RPLP1 (1:100; HPA003368, Sigma\u2010Aldrich), DDA1 (1:100; 14995\u20101\u2010AP; ProteinTech), NeuN (1:500; MAB377, Millipore), NeuN (1:500; ab177487, Abcam), collagen IV (1:1,000; AB756P, Millipore), GFAP (1:700; ab4674, Abcam), S100\u03b2 EP1576Y (1:100; ab52642, Abcam), Iba1 (1:500; 019\u201019741, Wako), Olig2 (1:500; AB9610, Millipore), and p\u2010Histone H2A.X (Ser139) (1:100; 05\u2010636, Millipore). Secondary antibodies: Alexa\u2010Fluor anti\u2010chicken 488, anti\u2010chicken 555, anti\u2010rabbit 488, anti\u2010rat 555, anti\u2010mouse 555, anti\u2010rabbit 555, anti\u2010rabbit 594, anti\u2010rabbit 633, anti\u2010mouse 647 (dilution 1:300; Invitrogen).\n        For squash preparations, mice with established brain metastases were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber and perfused with 4% PFA in 0.12\u00a0M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2\u20107.4. Whole brains were dissected and postfixed in the same fixative for 2\u00a0h at RT. Coronal sections (400\u00a0\u00b5m) were obtained with a vibratome. Squash preparations of dissociated tumor cells were generated following a previously reported procedure (Pena et\u00a0al, 2001). Briefly, small tissue fragments from the brain slices were dissected out under the control of a stereoscopic microscope. Each tissue fragment was transferred to a drop of PBS on a positively charged slide (SuperFrost\u00ae Plus, Thermo Scientific). A coverslip was applied on top of the slide, and the tissue was squashed by percussion with a histologic needle to dissociate tumor cells. The preparation was frozen in dry ice and the coverslip removed. Most tumor cells remained adhered to the slide. Cell samples were processed in 96% ethanol at 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, which increases the adhesion of cells to the slide, and rehydrated progressively in 70% ethanol and PBS. For immunofluorescence of squash preparations, cell samples were sequentially treated with 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 15\u00a0min, 0.1\u00a0M glycine in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30\u00a0min and 0.01% Tween\u201020 in PBS for 5\u00a0min. Primary antibodies were incubated in 1% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C and the following day for 30\u00a0min at RT (AHR, 1:300; 31.714.200, US Biological; UBE4B (UFD2), 1:100; sc\u2010377072, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After extensive washing in 0.01% Tween\u201020 in PBS, the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 or Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch) were incubated for 1\u00a0h at RT followed by two washes in PBS. Samples were mounted with the antifading medium Vectashield (Vector Labs) containing DAPI for the cytochemical staining of DNA.\n        Immunohistochemistry staining against p62 and p\u2010ERK (Ventana Discovery XT, Roche) as well as Ki67 (Ventana Discovery ULTRA, Roche) was performed using a standardized automated protocol. Antigen retrieval was performed using cell conditioning solution (CC1 mild), followed by endogenous peroxides blocking with peroxide hydrogen at 3%. Slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (anti\u2010p62 Ick ligand clone 3/P62 LCK LIGAND, 1:50; 610832, BD Biosciences; phospho\u2010p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), 1:300; #9101, Cell Signaling; Ki67 (D3B5), 1:50;\u00a0#12202, Cell Signaling). Slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualization systems (OmniMap) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunohistochemical reaction was developed using Discovery Purple and ChromoMap DAB kits, and nuclei were counterstained with Carazzi\u2019s hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium for microscopic evaluation.\n      \n      \n        \nMGMT methylation\u2011specific PCR (MSP)\n        DNA from formalin\u2010fixed paraffin\u2010embedded tumor tissues was extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A nested, two\u2010stage PCR approach to improve the sensitivity to detect methylated alleles was performed as previously described (Palmisano et\u00a0al, 2000). Genomic DNA was subjected to bisulfite treatment using the Epitect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) and PCR was performed to amplify a 289\u00a0bp fragment of the MGMT promoter region. The primers recognize the bisulfite\u2010modified template but do not discriminate between methylated and unmethylated alleles. The stage 1 PCR products were diluted 50\u2010fold, and 5\u00a0\u03bcl was subjected to a stage 2 PCR in which primers specific to methylated or unmethylated template were used. Taq Gold polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 50\u00a0\u03bcl volume reaction was used in all PCRs. PCR amplification protocol for stage 1 was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, followed by denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. PCR amplification protocol for stage 2 was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, followed by denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, annealing at 62\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 2 cycles. Next, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 2 cycles was performed. Finally, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 36 cycles followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7\u00a0min was performed. Placental DNA treated with SssI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs) was used as a positive control for methylated alleles of MGMT, and DNA from normal lymphocytes was used as a negative control. Controls without DNA (blank) were used for each set of methylation\u2010specific PCR assays. 7\u00a0\u03bcl of each methylation\u2010specific PCR product was loaded directly into 3% agarose gel, stained with real safe (Durviz), and examined under ultraviolet illumination. Primers used to selectively amplify unmethylated or methylated MGMT gene in the stage 2 PCR were as previously described (Esteller et\u00a0al, 2000; Hegi et\u00a0al, 2005).\n        Primers (5\u2032\u00a0>\u00a03\u2032, forward; reverse):\n\u2010\nMGMT (stage 1): (GGATATGTTGGGATAGTT; CCAAAAACCCCAAACCC)\u2010\nMGMT unmethylated (stage 2): (TTTGTGTTTTGATGTTTGTAGGTTTTTGT; AACTCCACACTCTTCCAAAAACAAAACA)\u2010\nMGMT methylated (stage 2): (TTTCGACGTTCGTAGGTTTTCGC; GCACTCTTCCGAAAACGAAACG)\n\n      \n      \n        \nEGFR mutational analysis\n        DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue samples, and macrodissection was performed to ensure a content of at least 60% tumor cells. Samples were tested by real\u2010time PCR in a cobas z480 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) using the cobas EGFR Mutation Test, which can detect mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the EGFR gene.\n      \n      \n        qRT\u2013PCR\n        Whole RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was used (1,000\u00a0ng) to generate cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (1708891, Bio\u2010Rad) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA obtained from mouse brains included microdissected established metastases from human BrM cells. Gene expression in the tumor was analyzed by using human primers using SYBR green gene expression assays (GoTaq qPCR Master Mix, A6002, Promega).\n        Primers (5\u2032\u00a0>\u00a03\u2032, forward; reverse):\n\u2010\nHSP90AA1: (AGATGACGACACATCACGCA; ACAGTGCACGTTACCCCAAT)\u2010\nHSP90AB1: (TGAGGAGGATGACAGCGGTA; TCAAAAAGGTCAAAGGGAGCC)\u2010\nHSPA4 (HSP70): (GCAAGTGACTGCCATGCTTT; TAAGCAGAGTGGCCCATGTC)\u2010\nHSPB2 (HSP27): (TAAACCTGGAAGCACCTCGG; ACATTGTGGACCATGCACCT)\u2010\nHSF1: (CCCTGATGCTGAACGACAGT; GGATAGGGGCCTCTCGTCTA)\u2010\nAHR: (ACAACCGATGGACTTGGGTC; TGGCAGGAAAAGGGTTGGTT)\u2010\nUBE4B: (GGTTGTGGTTGCCGAAATCC; CAGCCGCCATGTAACTGAGA)\u2010\nDDA1: (GCTACCTGCATCAGCAATGG; ACATCGGCTCCTATGAGGTTG)\n\n      \n      \n        Transcriptomics of relapsed tumors\n        500\u00a0ng of total RNA samples were used. Sample RNA Integrity numbers were 8.6 on average (range 5.9\u20139.5) when assayed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the QuantSeq 3\u2018mRNA\u2010Seq Library Prep Kit (FWD) for Illumina (Lexogen, Cat. No. 015) by following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Library generation is initiated by reverse transcription with oligodT priming, and a second strand synthesis is performed from random primers by a DNA polymerase. Primers from both steps contain Illumina\u2010compatible sequences. Libraries are completed by PCR {This kit generates directional libraries stranded in the sense orientation: the read1, the only read in single read format, has the\u00a0sense orientation (\u2010\u2010library\u2010type fr\u2010secondstrand in TopHat, \u2010\u2010stranded\u00a0=\u00a0yes in HTSeq)}. cDNA libraries are purified, applied to an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 (with v2.5 reagent kits) by following manufacturer's protocols. Eighty\u2010five\u2010base\u2010pair single\u2010end sequenced reads followed adapter and polyA tail removal as indicated by Lexogen. The resulting reads were fed to Xenome (Conway et\u00a0al, 2012) to separate the xenograft\u2010derived human and mouse reads. Human reads were analyzed with the nextpresso (Gra\u00f1a et\u00a0al, 2018) pipeline as follows: sequencing quality was checked with (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) FastQC v0.11.0. Reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) with TopHat\u20102.0.10 (Trapnell et\u00a0al, 2009) using Bowtie 1.0.0 (Langmead et\u00a0al, 2009) and Samtools 0.1.19 (Li et\u00a0al, 2009), allowing 3 mismatches and 20 multihits. The Gencode v29 gene annotation for GRCh38 was used. Read counts were obtained with HTSeq (Anders et\u00a0al, 2015). Differential expression and normalization were performed with DESeq2 (Love et\u00a0al, 2014), filtering out those genes where the normalized count value was lower than 2 in more than 50% of the samples. From the remaining genes, those that had an adjusted p value below 0.05 FDR were selected. GSEAPreranked (Subramanian et\u00a0al, 2005) was used to perform gene set enrichment analysis for several gene signatures on a pre\u2010ranked gene list, setting 1,000 gene set permutations. Only those gene sets with significant enrichment levels (FDR q\u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.25) were considered. Access to RNAseq data is provided from the Gene Expression Omnibus, under the ID GSE153173.\n      \n      \n        \nIn situ proteomics\n        Fixed organotypic cultures were embedded in paraffin. 10\u2010\u00b5m sections were placed on PET\u2010membrane slides (415190\u20109051\u2010000, Zeiss) pretreated with UV light. Slides were stained for 5\u00a0min in hematoxylin solution and 30\u00a0s in eosin solution, and were left unmounted. Fully established brain metastases were isolated using the ArcturusXT\u2122 Laser Capture Microdissection System (Thermo Scientific) and Arcturus\u00ae CapSure\u00ae Macro LCM Caps (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each dissection was validated by inspection of the cap and the sample. At least 12 brain metastases per biological sample were dissected. Dissected samples were processed using the commercially available in\u2010StageTip\u2010NHS kit (PreOmics GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Peptides were dissolved in HPLC\u2010grade water containing 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile. Randomization for sample run order was applied and the samples were individually analyzed using shot\u2010gun liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS) on a high accuracy Orbitrap Fusion\u2122 Lumos\u2122 Tribrid\u2122 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) coupled to an Acquity M nanoflow system (Waters GmbH). Samples were analyzed using 120\u00a0min gradient, top12 loop count, mass range 350\u20131,500\u00a0m/z, and an Acquity UPLC\u00ae M class 250\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a075\u00a0\u00b5M column. All raw files from LC\u2010MS/MS were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.6) using the standard settings against a human protein database (UniProtKB/Swiss\u2010Prot, 20,373 sequences) supplemented with contaminants. Label\u2010free quantification was done with match between runs (match window of 0.7\u00a0min and alignment window of 20\u00a0min). Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation of methionines and protein N\u2010term acetylation as variable modifications. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two tryptic missed\u2010cleavages were allowed. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020092. Results were filtered at 0.01 FDR (peptide and protein level). Then, the \u201cproteinGroups.txt\u201d file was loaded in Prostar (v1.14) (Wieczorek et\u00a0al, 2017) for further statistical analysis. Briefly, global normalization across samples was performed using the LOESS function and missing values were imputed using the algorithms slsa (for partially observed values) and detquantile (for values missing on an entire condition). Differential analysis was done using the empirical bayes statistics limma. Proteins with a P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and a log2 ratio >\u00a01 or <\u00a0\u22121 were defined as deregulated. The FDR was estimated to be 14% by Benjamini\u2010Hochberg. Functional analysis was performed with the GSEApreranked function (biocarta, canonical pathways, GO, KEGG, OncogenicSignatures, Reactome, TFs) using the log2 ratios as the input file to identify top 25 upregulated and downregulated signatures defined by NES values, FDR\u00a0<\u00a025% and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01.\n      \n      \n        Analysis of patient progression\n        After tumor resection, glioblastoma patients were treated by the standard of care, radiotherapy (Rx) plus temozolomide (TMZ), according to the Stupp protocol (Stupp et\u00a0al, 2005, 2009). MRI with volumetric analysis of brain lesions was performed at the following time\u2010points: immediately post\u2010surgery (24\u201348\u00a0h after resection), 1\u20132\u00a0weeks before chemoradiotherapy (Rx+TMZ), 4\u00a0weeks after chemoradiotherapy and then every 2\u20133\u00a0months depending on the clinical evolution. Patients were followed\u2010up until decease or the end of the study. Tumor response to treatment was assessed according to RANO criteria (Wen et\u00a0al, 2010).\n      \n      \n        Analysis of prognosis\n        The previously published exome capture RNA\u2010sequencing dataset of 21 cases of breast cancer brain metastases with clinical annotation (Vare\u0161lija et\u00a0al, 2019) has since been expanded to 45 cases (N\u00a0=\u00a090 patient\u2010matched samples; GSE184869). Gene expression of individual HSP90 target genes was assessed using log2 transformed trimmed M of means (TMM)\u2010normalized counts per million (log2(TMM\u2010CPM\u00a0+\u00a01)). Two groups of patients with low or high gene expression were delineated using the maximally selected rank statistics (Hothorn & Lausen, 2003), as implemented in the \u201csurvminer\u201d R package (Kassambara et\u00a0al, 2019) and Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves were generated depicting survival post\u2010brain metastasis. P values were obtained with long\u2010rank (Mantel\u2010Cox) two\u2010sided tests. In order to obtain the HSP90 signature score, first the z\u2010score of each individual target gene was calculated for all patients ((x \u2013 \u03bc)/\u03c3). For each patient, z\u2010scores of the respective target genes were added up and the average was calculated, resulting in the individual HSP90 signature score. Division into two groups (high/low) according to the HSP90 signature score and generation of Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves was performed using the above\u2010described approach. All samples were in compliance with protocols approved by the corresponding IRB (University of Pittsburgh IRB#PRO15050502, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland IRB#13/09/ICORG09/07 and the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Institutional Review Board).\n      \n      \n        Pharmacokinetics assay\n        Plasma and brain samples were collected 6\u00a0h after oral administration of DEBIO\u20100932 (160\u00a0mg/kg) to brain metastases\u2010bearing mice. Around 1\u00a0ml of blood was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C immediately after the extraction. Brain samples were homogenized in 4 volumes of H2O and sonicated for 10\u00a0min followed by centrifugation at 11,200 g for 5\u00a0min. The supernatant was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until processing. The extraction of DEBIO\u20100932 was achieved by solid\u2010phase extraction followed by high\u2010performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Agilent 1100, Sciex QTRAP 5500 System) analysis. The amount of DEBIO\u20100932 in each sample was quantified based on calibration curves generated using standards of known concentrations of DEBIO\u20100932. For the conversion of brain concentrations in ng/g to ng/mL, a tissue density of 1 was assumed.\n      \n      \n        Magnetic resonance imaging in mice\n        Magnetic resonance imaging studies were carried out in a Bruker Biospec 70/20 scanner using a combination of a linear coil (for transmission) with a mouse head phase array coil (for reception). Animals were anesthetized with sevoflurane (5% for induction and 3% for maintenance) and placed in an MRI\u2010adapted stereotaxic holder with a water circulating blanket to maintain body temperature. Respiration and body temperature were continuously monitored. As anatomical reference, a T2\u2010weighted sequence was acquired (TR\u00a0=\u00a04600\u00a0ms; TE, 65\u00a0ms; \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0; FOV\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0cm; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mm, number of slices\u00a0= 30). Then, a T1 sequence was acquired (TR\u00a0=\u00a0472.610\u00a0ms; TE, 3.648\u00a0ms; \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0; FOV\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0cm; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mm, number of slices\u00a0=\u00a030) before and after intravenous administration of 200\u00a0\u00b5l of Gadovist (1\u00a0mmol/ml, Bayer AG).\n      \n      \n        Image acquisition and analysis\n        Immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Leica SP5 up\u2010right confocal microscope \u00d75, \u00d710, \u00d720, \u00d740, and \u00d763 objectives and analyzed with ImageJ software and Definiens developer XD 2.5. Immunohistochemistry images were captured with the Zen Blue Software v3.1 (Zeiss), and whole slides were acquired with a slide scanner (AxioScan Z1, Zeiss). For histological quantification of brain metastases at endpoint (5\u00a0weeks after intracardiac inoculation of cancer cells), only lesions showing solid and compact distribution of cancer cells were considered as established metastases.\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        Data are represented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.e.m. Comparisons between two experimental groups were analyzed with unpaired, two\u2010tailed Student\u2019s t\u2010test. Survival analysis was done with log\u2010rank (Mantel\u2010Cox) test. Analysis of relapse cohort include quantification of the staining levels of DDA1, UBE4B or AHR with an H\u2010score, and categorized in binary variables according to the H\u2010score (above or below the average level for each cohort). The individual role of each gene in the relapse risk was calculated with the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and the Log\u2010Rank test; the attributable time\u2010dependent relative risk for each gene was calculated with the Cox\u2019s Proportional Hazards Model, adjusted by the traditional factors (T, N, Grade, age and Ki67). The cross\u2010correlation between the levels of (3 genes) was tested with R2 Pearson\u2019s test, and dot\u2010plot charts were generated.\n        Comparison of the levels of DDA1, UBE4B or AHR among the different cohorts (relapsed vs non\u2010relapsed, primary vs metastasis) was performed with a parametric T\u2010test comparison of the average H\u2010stainings, assuming homogeneous variances across subgroups.\n        All statistical tests were two\u2010sided and the statistical significance level was set at 0.05. Calculations were performed with the SPSS Statistics V. 19.0 software.\nChemicals and reagents\n        An in\u2010house chemical library composed of 114 FDA\u2010approved or in clinical trials anti\u2010tumoral drugs (Bejarano et\u00a0al, 2019) solved in DMSO (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was used for ex\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro screening. For in\u00a0vivo treatment, DEBIO\u20100932 (MedChemExpress) was formulated in 30% captisol (Ligand), chlorpromazine hydrochloride (Abcr) was solved in 0.9% saline solution and trifluoperazine hydrochloride (Merck) was formulated in 12.5% cremophor, 2.5% DMSO, and 85% saline. For ex\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro treatments, DEBIO\u20100932, methotrexate (MedChemExpress), bafilomycin A1 (Selleckchem), chlorpromazine (Sigma\u2010Aldrich), and BAY\u2010218 (Selleckchem) were solved in DMSO. CyQUANT\u2122 LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (C20301, Thermo Fisher) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CyQUANT\u2122 LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (C20301, Thermo Fisher) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAnimal studies\n        All animal experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the CNIO (IACUC.030\u20102015), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (CBA35_2015\u2010v2), and Comunidad de Madrid Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (PROEX250/15 and PROEX135/19). Females athymic nu/nu (Harlan) or equal proportions of C57BL/6 males and females mice (for the B16/F10\u2010BrM model) 4\u201310\u00a0weeks of age were used. Housing and husbandry conditions are in accredited by AAALAC. Mice are SPF with microbiological and environmental parameters constantly monitored. Brain colonization assays were performed by injecting 100\u00a0\u03bcl PBS into the left ventricle containing 100,000 or 40,000 cancer cells or 2\u00a0\u03bcl RPMI1640 intracranially (the right frontal cortex, approximately 1.5\u00a0mm lateral and 1\u00a0mm caudal flow bregma, and to a depth of 1\u00a0mm) containing 100,000 cancer cells by using a gas\u2010tight Hamilton syringe and a stereotactic apparatus. Brain colonization was analyzed in\u00a0vivo and ex\u00a0vivo by BLI. Anesthetized mice (isoflurane) were injected retro\u2010orbitally with D\u2010luciferin (150\u00a0mg/kg; Syd Labs) and imaged with an IVIS machine (Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence analysis was performed using Living Image software, version 4.5. Brain tumor resection was performed by adapting previously described procedures (Morrissy et\u00a0al, 2016). In brief, after exposing the skull, a craniotomy is performed surrounding the tumor area, which is visualized by GFP, using an excitation light source at 460\u2013495\u00a0nm (FS/ULS\u201002 B2, BLS Ltd) and goggles carrying emission filters (FHS/EF\u20103GY1, BLS Ltd). The skull and the dura are lifted with micro\u2010dissecting forceps, and the bulk of the tumor is then removed using a microcurette guided by GFP. When hemostasis is obtained, the surgical wound is sutured using interrupted stitching with absorbable sutures. Animals receive meloxicam at 5\u00a0mg/kg once per day during 72\u00a0h and dexamethasone at 13\u00a0mg/kg once per day during 48\u00a0h to contain brain edema. DEBIO\u20100932 was administered by oral gavage (160\u00a0mg/kg) for 3\u00a0weeks, daily during the first week and once every 48\u00a0h during the two following weeks, starting 7 or 14\u00a0days after intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM for preventive or interventive therapy, respectively. For preventive therapy of relapse after neurosurgery, DEBIO\u20100932 was administered by oral gavage (160\u00a0mg/kg) for 5\u20136\u00a0weeks, starting 3\u00a0days after neurosurgery. Treatment was given in an individualized regimen according to clinical symptoms of toxicity, including mouse weight, diarrhea, and activity of the animal. For combination therapy of DEBIO\u20100932 with autophagy inhibitors, DEBIO\u20100932 was administered following the interventive setting, and chlorpromazine at 5\u00a0mg/kg or trifluoperazine at 10\u00a0mg/kg was administered daily intraperitoneally for 3\u00a0weeks, starting at 14\u00a0days after intracardiac inoculation of H2030\u2010BrM cells. For interventive therapy of DEBIO\u20100932 (160\u00a0mg/kg) in B16/F10\u2010BrM tumors, treatment was given daily for 10\u00a0days starting at 3\u00a0days after intracranial inoculation of cancer cells.\nOrganotypic cultures\n        Organotypic cultures from adult mouse brain and liver were prepared as previously described (Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014). Brains with established metastases (5\u20137\u00a0weeks after intracardiac inoculation of cancer cells) or without metastases (wild\u2010type) and wild\u2010type livers were used. In brief, organs were dissected in HBSS supplemented with HEPES (pH 7.4, 2.5\u00a0mM), D\u2010glucose (30\u00a0mM), CaCl2 (1\u00a0mM), MgCl2 (1\u00a0mM), and NaHCO3 (4\u00a0mM) and embedded in 4% low\u2010melting agarose (Lonza) preheated at 42\u00b0C. The embedded organs were cut into 250\u2010\u03bcm slices using a vibratome (Leica). Brain slices were divided at the hemisphere into two pieces. Slices were placed with flat spatulas on top of 0.8\u2010\u03bcm pore membranes (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) floating on slice culture media (DMEM, supplemented HBSS, FBS 5%, l\u2010glutamine (1\u00a0mM), and 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin). Brain slices were imaged to confirm the presence of established metastases using BLI (day 0) and were cultured in the presence of the anti\u2010tumoral library at 10\u00a0\u00b5M of each compound. Brain slices were imaged 3\u00a0days after the addition of the inhibitors (day 3). For 7\u00a0days cultures, treatments were replaced at day 3 in fresh media and slices were imaged at day 7. If slices were obtained from wild\u2010type brains, 30,000 cancer cells suspended in 2\u00a0\u03bcl of slice culture media were placed on the surface of the slice and incubated in the presence of the inhibitors for 4\u00a0days. Brain slices were imaged 12\u201316\u00a0h after addition of cells (Day 0) and 3\u00a0days after the first BLI (Day 3). Growth rate was obtained by comparing the fold increases between Day 3/7 and Day 0, and normalized to values obtained from slices cultured with DMSO (100%). The BrdU pulse (0.2\u00a0mg/ml, Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was given by adding it in the media 2\u00a0h (H2030\u2010BrM) or 4\u00a0h (MDA231\u2010BrM) before fixation. Brain slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight and then free\u2010floating immunofluorescence was performed. For proteomic analysis, organotypic cultures with established brain metastases from H2030\u2010BrM were treated with DEBIO\u20100932 at 1\u00a0\u00b5M for 6\u00a0h followed by fixation with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. For analysis of autophagic flux, 200,000 B16/F10\u2010BrM cells with stable expression the autophagy probe GFP\u2010LC3\u2010RFP were added on wild\u2010type brain slices and incubated for 24\u00a0h, followed by DEBIO\u20100932 treatment at 10\u00a0\u00b5M for 12\u00a0h and fixation with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. For evaluation of hepatotoxicity, wild\u2010type liver slices were cultured in the presence of the corresponding inhibitors for 3\u00a0days and fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by free\u2010floating immunofluorescence.\nPatient\u2010derived organotypic cultures (PDOC)\n        Surgically resected human brain metastases and newly diagnosed glioblastomas were collected in neurobasal media A supplemented with 1 \u00d7 B27 (17504\u2010044, Gibco), 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0N\u20102 (17502\u2010048, Gibco), 25\u00a0ng/ml bFGF (13256029, Gibco), 100\u00a0ng/ml IGF1 (291\u2010G1, R&D Systems), 25\u00a0ng/ml EGF (E9644, Sigma\u2010Aldrich), 10\u00a0ng/ml NRG1\u2010\u03b21/HRG\u2010\u03b21 (396\u2010HB, R&D Systems), 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. Tissue was embedded in 4% low\u2010melting agarose, and 250\u2010\u00b5m slices were obtained using a vibratome. Slices from brain metastases were cultured in the presence of DEBIO\u20100932 at 10\u00a0\u00b5M and 1\u00a0\u00b5M for 3\u00a0days. Slices from glioblastomas were cultured in the presence of temozolomide (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) at 250\u00a0\u00b5M for 8\u00a0days and received 20\u00a0Gy of radiation fractionated in 2 doses of 10\u00a0Gy at days 1 and 4. Temozolomide treatment was replaced at Day 4 in fresh media. A BrdU pulse (4\u00a0h) was given at the end of the experiment followed by fixation of slices with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C and free\u2010floating immunofluorescence. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The experiments are aligned to the principles set out in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and the Department of Health and Human Services Belmont Report. All samples were in compliance with protocols approved by their respective Institutional Review Board (IRB) (CEI.PI.64_2016\u2010v3, CEI PI 25_2020\u2010v2, CEI PI 50_2021).\nCell culture\n        Human and mouse BrM cell lines have been previously described and obtained from the same batches that were previously published (Bos et\u00a0al, 2009; Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2009; Valiente et\u00a0al, 2014; Priego et\u00a0al, 2018). Cell lines were validated by morphological analysis and their behavior in\u00a0vivo. All cell lines were tested mycoplasma\u2010free. H2030\u2010BrM3 (abbreviated as H2030\u2010BrM) (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC) and PC9\u2010BrM3 (abbreviated as PC9\u2010BrM) (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC) were cultured in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. MDA231\u2010BrM2 (abbreviated as MDA231\u2010BrM) (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC), ErbB2\u2010BrM2 (abbreviated as ErbB2\u2010BrM) (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC), 393N1 (Origin: Massagu\u00e9 lab, MSKCC), and B16/F10\u2010BrM3 (abbreviated as B16/F10\u2010BrM) (Origin: Valiente Lab, CNIO) where cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. For retrovirus production, HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, 100\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. For the in\u00a0vitro screening with the anti\u2010tumoral library, H2030\u2010BrM cells were seeded in 96\u2010well microtiter plates at a density of 4,000\u00a0cells/well. Cells were incubated for 24\u00a0h before adding the compounds. Compounds were weighed out and solved in DMSO to a final concentration of 10\u00a0mM. From here, a \u201cmother plate\u201d with serial dilutions was prepared at 100\u00d7 the final concentration in the culture. The final concentration of DMSO in the tissue culture media should not exceed 1%. 2\u00a0\u00b5l of the compounds were added automatically (Beckman FX 96 tip) to 200\u00a0\u00b5l media to make it up to the final concentration for each drug. Each concentration was assayed in duplicate. Cells were exposed to the compounds for 72\u00a0h and then processed for CellTiter\u2010Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) readout according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and read on EndVision (Perkin Elmer). Proliferation rate (%) was calculated by normalizing luminescent values obtained for each compound to values obtained with DMSO (100%). For oncosphere generation, 1,000 H2030\u2010BrM cells were plated in low\u2010attachment plates in Humec medium (12753018, Gibco) supplemented with 1\u00d7 B27, 10\u00a0ng/ml bFGF, 20\u00a0ng/ml EGF, and 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml insulin solution from bovine pancreas (IGF1; I0516, Sigma\u2010Aldrich). Cells were grown for 14\u00a0days until oncospheres were formed, followed by treatment compounds from the anti\u2010tumoral library for 3\u00a0days. Growth rate was obtained by comparing the fold increases in BLI between Day 3 and Day 0, and normalized to values obtained from oncospheres cultured with DMSO (100%).\nVirus production\n        For lentivirus production, HEK293T cells at 70% confluence were transfected in Opti\u2010MEM with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight with 8.75\u00a0\u00b5g of the following plasmids: pMDLg/pRRE (#12251, Addgene), pRSV\u2010Rev (#12253, Addgene), VSV.G (#14888, Addgene), and lentiviral vectors carrying the corresponding shRNA against human AHR (sh#1: clone ID TRC21258, ATTAAGTCGGTCTCTATGCCG; sh#2: clone ID TRC21254, AAGACATTATATTGTTGTGGG; Horizon Discovery), human UBE4B (sh#1: clone ID TRC7546, TTAAAGGCAGTGTTATATCGG; sh#2: clone ID TRC7548, TATTGTGGATTTGATCCCTGC; Horizon Discovery), human DDA1 (sh#1: clone ID TRC142338, TCACGATGATCTGTTCAGACG; Horizon Discovery), or non\u2010targeting control. For retrovirus production, HEK293T cells at 70% confluence were transfected with 10\u00a0\u00b5g of pMRX\u2010IP\u2010GFP\u2010LC3\u2010RFP (#84573, Addgene), 5\u00a0\u00b5g of VSV.G (#14888, Addgene), and 5\u00a0\u00b5g pCL\u2010Eco (#12371, Addgene) in Opti\u2010MEM with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h. For both types of viruses, media was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine and virus production was maintained for 48\u00a0h. Viral supernatant was collected, passed through a 0.45\u2010\u00b5m syringe filter and added to the corresponding cells (lentivirus to H2030\u2010BrM and retrovirus to B16/F10\u2010BrM) at 50% confluence in RPMI1640 (H2030\u2010BrM) or DMEM (B16/F10\u2010BrM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, and polybrene (5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, Sigma\u2010Aldrich). The following day, media was replaced with the respective culture media. Selection with puromycin (2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was started 48\u00a0h after and maintained until complete cell death was observed in the non\u2010infected cancer cells.\nClinical samples and immunohistochemistry\n        Sixty brain metastases from lung cancer (40 cases) and breast cancer (20 cases) and thirty matched primary tumors (28 lung tumors and 2 breast tumors) were obtained from University Hospital of Turin to assess HSP90 levels. Twenty\u2010two brain metastases were obtained from Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre to evaluate UBE4B, AHR, ALK, ROS1, HER2, and BRAFV600E status. All samples followed protocols approved by the corresponding IRB (1\u201018\u201001/2016 and CEI.PI.64_2016\u2010v3) and the Biobank of the hospital, respectively. Immunohistochemistry against HSP90, DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR was performed at the CNIO Histopathology Core Facility using a standardized automated protocol (Ventana Discovery XT, Roche for HSP90; AS Link, Dako, Agilent for DDA1, UBE4B and AHR). All reagents, with exception of the primary antibodies, were purchased from Roche and Agilent. For HSP90, antigen retrieval was performed using cell conditioning solution (CC1 mild), followed by endogenous peroxides blocking with inhibitor CM. Antigen retrieval was performed with high pH buffer for AHR and low pH buffer for DDA1 and UBE4B, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with peroxide hydrogen at 3%. Slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies as follows: HSP90\u03b1/\u03b2 (clone F\u20108, 1:3,000; sc\u201013119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 8\u00a0min), DDA1 (1:2,400; 14995\u20101\u2010AP, ProteinTech), UBE4B (1:500; ab97697, Abcam) and AHR (1:400; 031714, USBiologicals Life Sciences). After the primary antibody, slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualization systems (OmniMap for HSP90 and EnVision FLEX\u00a0+\u00a0Rabbit Linker for DDA1, UBE4B, and AHR) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunohistochemical reaction was developed using ChromoMap DAB kit. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium for microscopic evaluation. Positive control sections known to be primary antibody positive were included for each staining run. Immunostains were blindly evaluated and scored by a pathologist. Intensity of the staining was evaluated and a representative score (the score covering the largest tumor area) was assigned to each sample. Percentage of cancer cells positive for cytoplasmic HSP90 over total tumor area was quantified. Nuclear HSP90 was scored by quantifying percentage of cancer cells positive for nuclear HSP90 normalized to total tumor. Immunohistochemistry against ALK, ROS1, HER2, and BRAFV600E was performed on 4\u2010\u00b5m\u2010thick sections of formalin\u2010fixed and paraffin\u2010embedded brain samples at Hospital 12 de Octubre. For immunostaining against ROS1 and BRAFV600E, a standardized automated protocol using the Leica Bond Polymer Refining Kit (Leica Bond\u2010III stainer, Leica Biosystems) was performed. Antigen retrieval was performed using 30\u00b4 EDTA, pH 9.0, followed by endogenous peroxides blocking with hydrogen peroxide. Slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (ROS1, 1:200; mAb3287, Cell Signaling; anti\u2010BRAFV600E clone VE1, 1:50; E19294, Spring Bioscience). For immunostaining against ALK, a standardized automated protocol using the OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit (BenchMark GT automated immunostainer, Ventana, Roche) was performed. Antigen retrieval was performed using CC1 92\u00b4, followed by endogenous peroxides blocking. Slides were incubated with the primary antibody (anti\u2010ALK clone D5F3, prediluted; 790\u20134794, Ventana). After the primary antibodies, slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualization systems (OptiView DAB for ALK and Leica Bond Polymer Refining Kit for ROS1 and BRAF) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunohistochemical reaction was developed using DAB. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium for microscopic evaluation. For immunostaining against HER2, the Bond Oracle HER2 IHC System (Leica Biosystems) was used.\n        Samples used to evaluate the correlation of DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR with relapse belong to two patient cohorts analyzed. All cohorts were composed by women with a diagnosis of primary, non\u2010metastatic breast cancer with expression of estrogen and/or progestogen receptor >\u00a01% and lack of HER2 amplification at Hospital 12 de Octubre. Cohort #1 aimed to analyze the impact of DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR protein levels in the relapse risk. Thus, it was constituted by all the hormone\u2010positive consecutive patients diagnosed in that hospital in 2001 (N\u00a0=\u00a0251) in order to ensure long follow\u2010up. The second cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a011) of cases that showed distant relapse was collected to investigate potential up\u2010 or down\u2010regulation of DDA1, UBE4B, or AHR from the primary to the metastatic lesion; thus, pairs of primary tumor plus their metastases of hormone\u2010positive breast cancers, regardless of the status of traditional prognostic factors were gathered just on the basis of availability of biopsy from the metastatic setting. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hospital 12 de Octubre (Ref: 11/137) and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Processing of these breast cancer tissues for routine histological analysis was fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA) and embedded in paraffin. Tissue microarrays were mounted with two 1\u2010mm cores per sample (Quick\u2010Ray Instruments, UNITMA). An expert pathologist examined a template H&E slide from each sample to select the areas for core selection. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 2.5\u2010\u03bcm TMA sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an automated protocol developed for the Autostainer Link automated slide staining system (DAKO, Agilent) as described above. Corresponding TMA was acquired and digitalized using the AxioScan.Z1 system (Zeiss). Digitalized images were automatically analyzed with the ZEN 2.3 lite software (Zeiss). For staining quartile determination, H\u2010scores were calculated by formula: ((% of Area High Intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03)\u00a0+\u00a0(% of Area Medium Intensity \u00d7 2)\u00a0+\u00a0(% of Area Low Intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01))/100.\nImmunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry\n        Tissue for immunofluorescence was obtained after overnight fixation with 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C. Slicing of the brain was done by using a vibratome (Leica) or sliding microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Both types of brain slices (250\u00a0\u03bcm and 80\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively) were blocked in 10% NGS, 2% BSA, and 0.25% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 2\u00a0h at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the blocking solution and the following day for 30\u00a0min at RT. After extensive washing in PBS\u2010Triton 0.25%, the secondary antibody was added in the blocking solution and incubated for 2\u00a0h. After extensive washing in PBS\u2010Triton 0.25%, nuclei were stained with bisbenzamide (1\u00a0mg/ml; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) for 7\u00a0min at RT. Brain slices were pretreated with methanol for 20\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0C before the blocking step for nuclear staining against DDA1 and p\u2010Histone H2A.X (Ser139). For staining against BrdU, mouse brain slices or PDOC were treated with HCI 2N 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 0.1\u00a0M borate buffer (pH 8.5) incubation for 10\u00a0min at RT. After extensive washing in TBS, slices were blocked in 3% NGS in TBS\u2010Triton 0.25% for 1\u00a0h at RT and primary antibody was incubated for 72\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. After extensive washing with TBS\u2010Triton 0.25%, the secondary antibody was incubated in blocking solution for 2\u00a0h at RT followed by extensive washing with TBS. Primary antibodies: GFP (1:1,000; GFP\u20101020, Aves Labs), BrdU (1:500; ab6326, Abcam), Ki67 (1:500; ab15580, Abcam), Cleaved Caspase\u20103 (Asp175) (1:500; #9661, Cell Signaling), HSP90\u03b1/\u03b2 F\u20108 (1:500; sc\u201013119; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HSP70/ HSC70 W27 (1:500; sc\u201024; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AHR (1:300; 31.714.200, US Biological), RPLP1 (1:100; HPA003368, Sigma\u2010Aldrich), DDA1 (1:100; 14995\u20101\u2010AP; ProteinTech), NeuN (1:500; MAB377, Millipore), NeuN (1:500; ab177487, Abcam), collagen IV (1:1,000; AB756P, Millipore), GFAP (1:700; ab4674, Abcam), S100\u03b2 EP1576Y (1:100; ab52642, Abcam), Iba1 (1:500; 019\u201019741, Wako), Olig2 (1:500; AB9610, Millipore), and p\u2010Histone H2A.X (Ser139) (1:100; 05\u2010636, Millipore). Secondary antibodies: Alexa\u2010Fluor anti\u2010chicken 488, anti\u2010chicken 555, anti\u2010rabbit 488, anti\u2010rat 555, anti\u2010mouse 555, anti\u2010rabbit 555, anti\u2010rabbit 594, anti\u2010rabbit 633, anti\u2010mouse 647 (dilution 1:300; Invitrogen).\n        For squash preparations, mice with established brain metastases were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber and perfused with 4% PFA in 0.12\u00a0M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2\u20107.4. Whole brains were dissected and postfixed in the same fixative for 2\u00a0h at RT. Coronal sections (400\u00a0\u00b5m) were obtained with a vibratome. Squash preparations of dissociated tumor cells were generated following a previously reported procedure (Pena et\u00a0al, 2001). Briefly, small tissue fragments from the brain slices were dissected out under the control of a stereoscopic microscope. Each tissue fragment was transferred to a drop of PBS on a positively charged slide (SuperFrost\u00ae Plus, Thermo Scientific). A coverslip was applied on top of the slide, and the tissue was squashed by percussion with a histologic needle to dissociate tumor cells. The preparation was frozen in dry ice and the coverslip removed. Most tumor cells remained adhered to the slide. Cell samples were processed in 96% ethanol at 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, which increases the adhesion of cells to the slide, and rehydrated progressively in 70% ethanol and PBS. For immunofluorescence of squash preparations, cell samples were sequentially treated with 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 15\u00a0min, 0.1\u00a0M glycine in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30\u00a0min and 0.01% Tween\u201020 in PBS for 5\u00a0min. Primary antibodies were incubated in 1% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C and the following day for 30\u00a0min at RT (AHR, 1:300; 31.714.200, US Biological; UBE4B (UFD2), 1:100; sc\u2010377072, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After extensive washing in 0.01% Tween\u201020 in PBS, the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 or Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch) were incubated for 1\u00a0h at RT followed by two washes in PBS. Samples were mounted with the antifading medium Vectashield (Vector Labs) containing DAPI for the cytochemical staining of DNA.\n        Immunohistochemistry staining against p62 and p\u2010ERK (Ventana Discovery XT, Roche) as well as Ki67 (Ventana Discovery ULTRA, Roche) was performed using a standardized automated protocol. Antigen retrieval was performed using cell conditioning solution (CC1 mild), followed by endogenous peroxides blocking with peroxide hydrogen at 3%. Slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (anti\u2010p62 Ick ligand clone 3/P62 LCK LIGAND, 1:50; 610832, BD Biosciences; phospho\u2010p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), 1:300; #9101, Cell Signaling; Ki67 (D3B5), 1:50;\u00a0#12202, Cell Signaling). Slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualization systems (OmniMap) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunohistochemical reaction was developed using Discovery Purple and ChromoMap DAB kits, and nuclei were counterstained with Carazzi\u2019s hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium for microscopic evaluation.\nqRT\u2013PCR\n        Whole RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was used (1,000\u00a0ng) to generate cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (1708891, Bio\u2010Rad) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA obtained from mouse brains included microdissected established metastases from human BrM cells. Gene expression in the tumor was analyzed by using human primers using SYBR green gene expression assays (GoTaq qPCR Master Mix, A6002, Promega).\n        Primers (5\u2032\u00a0>\u00a03\u2032, forward; reverse):\n\u2010\nHSP90AA1: (AGATGACGACACATCACGCA; ACAGTGCACGTTACCCCAAT)\u2010\nHSP90AB1: (TGAGGAGGATGACAGCGGTA; TCAAAAAGGTCAAAGGGAGCC)\u2010\nHSPA4 (HSP70): (GCAAGTGACTGCCATGCTTT; TAAGCAGAGTGGCCCATGTC)\u2010\nHSPB2 (HSP27): (TAAACCTGGAAGCACCTCGG; ACATTGTGGACCATGCACCT)\u2010\nHSF1: (CCCTGATGCTGAACGACAGT; GGATAGGGGCCTCTCGTCTA)\u2010\nAHR: (ACAACCGATGGACTTGGGTC; TGGCAGGAAAAGGGTTGGTT)\u2010\nUBE4B: (GGTTGTGGTTGCCGAAATCC; CAGCCGCCATGTAACTGAGA)\u2010\nDDA1: (GCTACCTGCATCAGCAATGG; ACATCGGCTCCTATGAGGTTG)\nTranscriptomics of relapsed tumors\n        500\u00a0ng of total RNA samples were used. Sample RNA Integrity numbers were 8.6 on average (range 5.9\u20139.5) when assayed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the QuantSeq 3\u2018mRNA\u2010Seq Library Prep Kit (FWD) for Illumina (Lexogen, Cat. No. 015) by following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Library generation is initiated by reverse transcription with oligodT priming, and a second strand synthesis is performed from random primers by a DNA polymerase. Primers from both steps contain Illumina\u2010compatible sequences. Libraries are completed by PCR {This kit generates directional libraries stranded in the sense orientation: the read1, the only read in single read format, has the\u00a0sense orientation (\u2010\u2010library\u2010type fr\u2010secondstrand in TopHat, \u2010\u2010stranded\u00a0=\u00a0yes in HTSeq)}. cDNA libraries are purified, applied to an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 (with v2.5 reagent kits) by following manufacturer's protocols. Eighty\u2010five\u2010base\u2010pair single\u2010end sequenced reads followed adapter and polyA tail removal as indicated by Lexogen. The resulting reads were fed to Xenome (Conway et\u00a0al, 2012) to separate the xenograft\u2010derived human and mouse reads. Human reads were analyzed with the nextpresso (Gra\u00f1a et\u00a0al, 2018) pipeline as follows: sequencing quality was checked with (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) FastQC v0.11.0. Reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) with TopHat\u20102.0.10 (Trapnell et\u00a0al, 2009) using Bowtie 1.0.0 (Langmead et\u00a0al, 2009) and Samtools 0.1.19 (Li et\u00a0al, 2009), allowing 3 mismatches and 20 multihits. The Gencode v29 gene annotation for GRCh38 was used. Read counts were obtained with HTSeq (Anders et\u00a0al, 2015). Differential expression and normalization were performed with DESeq2 (Love et\u00a0al, 2014), filtering out those genes where the normalized count value was lower than 2 in more than 50% of the samples. From the remaining genes, those that had an adjusted p value below 0.05 FDR were selected. GSEAPreranked (Subramanian et\u00a0al, 2005) was used to perform gene set enrichment analysis for several gene signatures on a pre\u2010ranked gene list, setting 1,000 gene set permutations. Only those gene sets with significant enrichment levels (FDR q\u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.25) were considered. Access to RNAseq data is provided from the Gene Expression Omnibus, under the ID GSE153173.\nAnalysis of patient progression\n        After tumor resection, glioblastoma patients were treated by the standard of care, radiotherapy (Rx) plus temozolomide (TMZ), according to the Stupp protocol (Stupp et\u00a0al, 2005, 2009). MRI with volumetric analysis of brain lesions was performed at the following time\u2010points: immediately post\u2010surgery (24\u201348\u00a0h after resection), 1\u20132\u00a0weeks before chemoradiotherapy (Rx+TMZ), 4\u00a0weeks after chemoradiotherapy and then every 2\u20133\u00a0months depending on the clinical evolution. Patients were followed\u2010up until decease or the end of the study. Tumor response to treatment was assessed according to RANO criteria (Wen et\u00a0al, 2010).\nAnalysis of prognosis\n        The previously published exome capture RNA\u2010sequencing dataset of 21 cases of breast cancer brain metastases with clinical annotation (Vare\u0161lija et\u00a0al, 2019) has since been expanded to 45 cases (N\u00a0=\u00a090 patient\u2010matched samples; GSE184869). Gene expression of individual HSP90 target genes was assessed using log2 transformed trimmed M of means (TMM)\u2010normalized counts per million (log2(TMM\u2010CPM\u00a0+\u00a01)). Two groups of patients with low or high gene expression were delineated using the maximally selected rank statistics (Hothorn & Lausen, 2003), as implemented in the \u201csurvminer\u201d R package (Kassambara et\u00a0al, 2019) and Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves were generated depicting survival post\u2010brain metastasis. P values were obtained with long\u2010rank (Mantel\u2010Cox) two\u2010sided tests. In order to obtain the HSP90 signature score, first the z\u2010score of each individual target gene was calculated for all patients ((x \u2013 \u03bc)/\u03c3). For each patient, z\u2010scores of the respective target genes were added up and the average was calculated, resulting in the individual HSP90 signature score. Division into two groups (high/low) according to the HSP90 signature score and generation of Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves was performed using the above\u2010described approach. All samples were in compliance with protocols approved by the corresponding IRB (University of Pittsburgh IRB#PRO15050502, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland IRB#13/09/ICORG09/07 and the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Institutional Review Board).\nPharmacokinetics assay\n        Plasma and brain samples were collected 6\u00a0h after oral administration of DEBIO\u20100932 (160\u00a0mg/kg) to brain metastases\u2010bearing mice. Around 1\u00a0ml of blood was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C immediately after the extraction. Brain samples were homogenized in 4 volumes of H2O and sonicated for 10\u00a0min followed by centrifugation at 11,200 g for 5\u00a0min. The supernatant was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until processing. The extraction of DEBIO\u20100932 was achieved by solid\u2010phase extraction followed by high\u2010performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Agilent 1100, Sciex QTRAP 5500 System) analysis. The amount of DEBIO\u20100932 in each sample was quantified based on calibration curves generated using standards of known concentrations of DEBIO\u20100932. For the conversion of brain concentrations in ng/g to ng/mL, a tissue density of 1 was assumed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging in mice\n        Magnetic resonance imaging studies were carried out in a Bruker Biospec 70/20 scanner using a combination of a linear coil (for transmission) with a mouse head phase array coil (for reception). Animals were anesthetized with sevoflurane (5% for induction and 3% for maintenance) and placed in an MRI\u2010adapted stereotaxic holder with a water circulating blanket to maintain body temperature. Respiration and body temperature were continuously monitored. As anatomical reference, a T2\u2010weighted sequence was acquired (TR\u00a0=\u00a04600\u00a0ms; TE, 65\u00a0ms; \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0; FOV\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0cm; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mm, number of slices\u00a0= 30). Then, a T1 sequence was acquired (TR\u00a0=\u00a0472.610\u00a0ms; TE, 3.648\u00a0ms; \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0; FOV\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0cm; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mm, number of slices\u00a0=\u00a030) before and after intravenous administration of 200\u00a0\u00b5l of Gadovist (1\u00a0mmol/ml, Bayer AG).\nImage acquisition and analysis\n        Immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Leica SP5 up\u2010right confocal microscope \u00d75, \u00d710, \u00d720, \u00d740, and \u00d763 objectives and analyzed with ImageJ software and Definiens developer XD 2.5. Immunohistochemistry images were captured with the Zen Blue Software v3.1 (Zeiss), and whole slides were acquired with a slide scanner (AxioScan Z1, Zeiss). For histological quantification of brain metastases at endpoint (5\u00a0weeks after intracardiac inoculation of cancer cells), only lesions showing solid and compact distribution of cancer cells were considered as established metastases.\nStatistical analysis\n        Data are represented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.e.m. Comparisons between two experimental groups were analyzed with unpaired, two\u2010tailed Student\u2019s t\u2010test. Survival analysis was done with log\u2010rank (Mantel\u2010Cox) test. Analysis of relapse cohort include quantification of the staining levels of DDA1, UBE4B or AHR with an H\u2010score, and categorized in binary variables according to the H\u2010score (above or below the average level for each cohort). The individual role of each gene in the relapse risk was calculated with the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and the Log\u2010Rank test; the attributable time\u2010dependent relative risk for each gene was calculated with the Cox\u2019s Proportional Hazards Model, adjusted by the traditional factors (T, N, Grade, age and Ki67). The cross\u2010correlation between the levels of (3 genes) was tested with R2 Pearson\u2019s test, and dot\u2010plot charts were generated.\n        Comparison of the levels of DDA1, UBE4B or AHR among the different cohorts (relapsed vs non\u2010relapsed, primary vs metastasis) was performed with a parametric T\u2010test comparison of the average H\u2010stainings, assuming homogeneous variances across subgroups.\n        All statistical tests were two\u2010sided and the statistical significance level was set at 0.05. Calculations were performed with the SPSS Statistics V. 19.0 software.\nAuthor contributions\n      \nLuc\u00eda Zhu: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Validation; Investigation; Visualization; Methodology; Writing\u2014original draft; Writing\u2014review and editing.
