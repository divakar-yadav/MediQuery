    "description": "Background\n          Chemoresistance influences the therapeutic effect of cisplatin and remains a major obstacle to its clinical use. MicroRNAs are associated with drug resistance of various tumors. However, the association between microRNAs and cisplatin in lung cancer remains largely unclear.\nMETHODS\n      \n        Materials\n        Cisplatin and curcumin were purchased from Sigma, the cell counting kit\u20108 was purchased from DOjinDO (CCK\u20108, DOjinDO Laboratories), and the miRNeasy mini\u2010kit was purchased from Qiagen. MiR\u2010192 mimics and miR\u2010192 inhibitor were obtained from GenePharma. Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was purchased from Life technologies. Monoclonal antibody specific to NKRF, p\u2010\u03baB, I\u03baB, NF\u2010\u03baB p65, PARP\u20101, cIAP1, cIAP2, Bcl\u2010xl and XIAP were purchased from Abcam, cell signaling technology (Danvers) and Santa Cruz, respectively. pNF\u03baB\u2010luc was purchased from Beyotime, pMIR\u2010GLO dual\u2010luciferase miRNA target report vector and dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay system were purchased from Promega.\n      \n      \n        Cell culture and transfection\n        Human lung adenocarcinoma cisplatin\u2010sensitive cell line A549 (A549) and cisplatin\u2010resistance cell line A549/DDP (A549/DDP) were obtained from the cell bank of the Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenviroment (Tianjin, China). The biological characteristics and drug resistance of the cells have previously been demonstrated.\n26\n Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The A549/DDP cells were preserved in a 2\u2009\u03bcg/ml final concentration of cisplatin to sustain cisplatin resistance. All cell lines were grown under identical conditions. For transfection, cells were cultured to 40%\u201350% confluence and transfected with plasmids or miR\u2010192 mimics or miR\u2010192 inhibitor or control using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n      \n      \n        \nMicroRNA microarray analysis\n        Differentially expressed miRNAs between A549 and A549/DDP cells were identified using Agilent Human 18.0 miRNA array (Agilent Technologies Inc). MiRNAs were extracted using the miRNeasy mini\u2010kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization, scanning, and data processing were performed by Biotechnology Corporation.\n      \n      \n        Quantitative real\u2010time PCR\n\n        Quantitative RT\u2010PCR was performed to validate the MiRNA and gene mRNA expression levels. RT\u2010PCR was carried out using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan). Reverse transcriptions were carried out in triplicate and analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900HT fast real\u2010time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantification values for each miRNA and gene were calculated by the 2\u2010\u0394\u0394Ct method using U6 and GAPDH as an internal reference, respectively.

After incubating for 24\u2009h to allow for cell attachment and recovery, A549 cells were treated with cisplatin at the concentration of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\u2009\u03bcg/ml and A549/DDP at the concentration of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\u2009ug/ml and incubated for 48\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. Then, 10\u2009\u03bcl of CCK\u20108 was added to each well and incubated for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were then analyzed on microplate readers (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices) at 450 and 630\u2009nm (background) to determine the absorbance of the samples.\n      \n      \n        Cell cycle analysis\n        Cell cycle analysis was determined using propidium iodide (PI) staining. In brief, the cells were fixed with 70% ice\u2010cold ethanol, followed by staining with freshly prepared nuclei staining buffer (0.1% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS, 200\u2009\u03bcg/ml of RNaseA, and 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml of PI) for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Cell\u2010cycle histograms were generated using fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting analysis. The percentage of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were counted and compared.\n      \n      \n        Apoptosis analysis\n        Cell apoptosis was detected by FITC Annexin V staining. First, the cells were harvested and washed with ice\u2010cold phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), and then subjected to the FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen) for staining. Finally, the cells were analyzed using a FACScan instrument (Beckman Coulter) and the data were measured using WinMDI 2.9.\n      \n      \n        Plasmids and luciferase assay\n        For the miR\u2010192\u2010target analysis, two fragments of NKRF\u2010WT or NKRF\u2010Mut were cloned into the downstream of the pMIR\u2010GLO dual luciferase miRNA target vector according to protocol. pNF\u03baB\u2010luc vector was purchased from Beyotime which contained several \u03baB sites reflecting the transcriptional activity of NF\u2010\u03baB. In a 48\u2010well plate format, a final concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of reporter plasmid DNA and 100\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 mimics or 100\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 inhibitor mixed in 250\u2009\u03bcl of serum\u2010free medium were used for each transfection. In the cotransfection system, 50\u2009ng pRL\u2010SV40 reporter plasmids, 100\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 mimics or 200\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 inhibitor and 250\u2009ng reporter plasmid DNA were added. At 48\u2009h post\u2010transfection, luciferase activities using the dual\u2010luciferase assay system were measured (Promega).\n      \n      \n        Western blotting\n        Cells were lysed on ice for 30\u2009min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer which included protease inhibitors (Beyotime) and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 4\u00b0C, 12000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min. The total proteins were resolved on 8%\u201315% gradient SDS\u2010polacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) filtration membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h in 5% skim milk in TBST and with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with appropriate HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibody at optimized concentration. The densitometry of Western blot results was measured using ImageJ software.\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        The data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Two\u2010tailed Student's t\u2010test was used to determine the significant differences between the control and treatment groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 20.0 (SPSS, IBM) software and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\n      \n        \nMiR\u2010192 is upregulated in cisplatin resistant cells\n        To determine the correlation of dysregulated miRNAs with cisplatin chemoresistance in lung cancer, miRNA microarrays was performed between human lung cancer cisplatin sesItive A549 cells (called as A549) and cisplatin\u2010resistance A549/DDP cells (called as A549/DDP), and A total of 106 miRNAs were detected, with above 2\u2010fold expression change. Among these miRNAs, miR\u201098\u20105p, 195\u20105p, 193a\u20105p, 194\u20105p, 192\u20105p, 3613\u20103p, 183\u20105p and 3653 were upregulated in A549/DDP cells and confirmed by qRT\u2010PCR assay. These result showed that these eight miRNAs were significantly upregulated in A549/DDP cells compared to A549 cells, and therefore in good accordance with the microarray data (Figure\u00a01). However, we were particularly interested in miRNA\u2010192 because of the high upregulation in A549/DDP cells (37.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2010fold) and its role in promoting drug resistance to lung cancer.\n20\n, \n21\n These data indicated that miR\u2010192 might play an important role in the development of cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells.\n        \n          FIGURE 1\n          \n            MicroRNA modulation in A549/DDP cells. (a) 106 microRNAs were differentially expressed in A549 and A549/DDP cells (>2\u2010fold was considered to be significant). Top 20 up\u2010 and downregulated miRNAs in A549/DDP cells are shown. (b) MiR\u2010192 mRNA levels were determined by real\u2010time PCR, U6 was used as an internal control. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments and are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. **p\u2009<\u20090.01 versus A549 cells\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \nMiR\u2010192 confers cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells\n        Little is known about the effects of miR\u2010192 in lung cancer cisplatin chemoresistance. To investigate the association between miR\u2010192 expression and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, we overexpressed miR\u2010192 in A549 cells and downregulated in A549/DDP (Figure\u00a02a, b). We then tested the drug sensitivities by CCK\u20108 assay, and the IC50 values for cisplatin were 15.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in A549\u2010miR\u2010192\u2010mimic cells, significantly higher than 3.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.90\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in A549\u2010NC (Figure\u00a02c). The IC50 values for cisplatin were 7.28\u2009\u00b1\u20091.10\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in A549/DDP\u2010miR\u2010192\u2010inhibitor cells, lower than 12.51\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in A549/DDP\u2010NC (Figure\u00a02d). The results indicated that enforced miR\u2010192 enhanced the cisplatin chemoresistance of lung cancer, whereas knockdown of miR\u2010192 could reverse the cisplatin chemoresistance of lung cancer. Similar results were obtained when comparing the miR\u2010192\u2010treated group with the vehicle group, whilst there was no significant difference between the NC and vehicle groups. These data highlighted the significant functions of MiR\u2010192 in enhancing the resistance of lung cancer to cisplatin and conferring drug resistance.\n        \n          FIGURE 2\n          \n            MiR\u2010192 enhances resistance to cisplatin in lung cancer cells. (a) A549 and A549/DDP cells were transfected with a miR\u2010192 mimic and inhibitor, respectively. miR\u2010192 expression levels were detected by real\u2010time PCR at 48\u2009h post\u2010transfection. MiRNA abundance was normalised by U6. (b) The IC50 for cisplatin at 48\u2009h post\u2010transfection was measured by CCK\u20108 assay\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \nMiR\u2010192 inhibits apoptosis, promotes growth, and enhances survival in lung cancer cisplatin chemoresistant cells\n        Next, we tested the functional significance of miR\u2010192 in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. A549 and A549/DDP cells were transfected with miR\u2010192 mimics or miR\u2010192 inhibitor, respectively. MTT assay was used to investigate the effect of miR\u2010192 on cell proliferation. As shown in Figure\u00a03a, when transfected with miR\u2010192 mimics, the proliferation ability of A549 cells was enhanced compared to the control group, whereas the proliferation ability of A549/DDP cells was reduced compared to the control group (Figure\u00a03b) when transfected with miR\u2010192 inhibitor. Additionally, we performed flow cytometry analysis to investigate the effect of miR\u2010192 on cell apoptosis and cell cycle. As shown in Figures\u00a03c and e, forced expression of miR\u2010192 resulted in decreased apoptosis in A549 cells from 27.52%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85 to 6.45%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.87 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with control (NC), and decreased the percentage of cells in the G1 phase from 66.03%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.24 to 56.73%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.21 (p\u2009<\u20090.05); and increased the percentage of cells in the S phase from 19.17%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.11 to 23.30%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.95 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, inhibited expression of miR\u2010192 in A549/DDP cells increased apoptosis from 31.41%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.95 to 44.46%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with NC; increased the percentage of cells in G1 phase from 60.50%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.94 to 67.45%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.46 (p\u2009<\u20090.05); and decreased the percentage of cells in G2 phase from 9.20%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.06 to 5.65%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Similar results were obtained when comparing the miR\u2010192\u2010treated group with the vehicle group. There was no significant difference between the NC and vehicle groups. Our data indicate that miR\u2010192 decreases apoptosis induced by cisplatin and promotes G1/S phase transition.\n        \n          FIGURE 3\n          \n            Effect of miR\u2010192 on lung cancer cells.

Data are representative of at least three independent experiments and are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 and **p\u2009<\u20090.01 versus negative control (NC)\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \nMiR\u2010192 directly inhibits the expression of NKRF through 3\u2032UTR\n\n        To discover the underlying molecular mechanisms of the phenotypes observed in A549 and A549/DDP cells following miR\u2010192 up\u2010 or downregulation, we employed TargestScan, miRanda, TargetScan, PicTar and RNA22 programs to determine the miR\u2010192 targets and NF\u2010\u03baB repressing factor (NKRF) (Figure\u00a04a). To determine whether NKRF was a direct target of miR\u2010192, we cloned the wild\u2010type or mutant 3\u2032UTR sequence of NKRF into pMIR reporter vector, respectively, as shown in Figure\u00a04b, and performed a luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that overexpression of miR\u2010192 caused a remarkable decrease in the luciferase activity in A549 cells when the NKRF plasmid containing wild\u2010type 3\u2032\u2010UTR was present, whereas its mutant counterpart was not (Figure\u00a04c). Additionally, downexpression of miR\u2010192 cause a significant increase in the luciferase activity in A549/DDP when the NKRF plasmid containing wild\u2010type 3'\u2010UTR was present, whereas its mutant counterpart was not (Figure\u00a04d). Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that overexpression of miR\u2010192 significantly suppressed NKRF expression in A549 cells and silencing of miR\u2010192 increased NKRF expression in A549/DDP cells, but mRNA level did not change (Figure\u00a04e, f). In addition, we used the TCGA database to analyze the correlation between miR\u2010192 and NKRF expression in lung adenocarcinoma, and found that miR\u2010192 and NKRF was negatively correlated (Figure\u00a04g). The \u201cK\u2010M plot\u201d online website showed that high NKRF expression had a longer survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Figure\u00a04h). Taken together, these results indicated that NKRF is the direct target of miR\u2010192, and is associated with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.\n        \n          FIGURE 4\n          \n            NKRF is a direct target of miR\u2010192.

The transcriptional activation of NF\u2010\u03baB was evaluated by dual luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Figure\u00a05a, overexpression of miR\u2010192 increased the luciferase activity in A549 cells, while silencing of miR\u2010192 decreased the luciferase activity in A549/DDP cells. Furthermore, NF\u2010\u03baB activation was also analysed by nuclear translocation assay in A549 and A549/DDP cells. Western blot results showed that forced expression of miR\u2010192 in A549 increased the nuclear protein level of NF\u2010\u03baB, decreased the cytoplasmic protein level of NF\u2010\u03baB, whereas the opposite was achieved in downexpression of MiR\u2010192 in A549/DDP (Figure\u00a05b).\n        \n          FIGURE 5\n          \n            NF\u2010\u03baB activity is increased by miR\u2010192.

As shown in Figure\u00a05c, overexpression of miR\u2010192 significantly upregulated both the mRNA and protein level of all these genes in A549 cells, whereas downexpression of MiR\u2010192 in A549/DDP achieved the opposite. These results suggest that miR\u2010192 could activate the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, in turn, NF\u2010\u03baB pathway contributes to enhanced miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        Inhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB reverses miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells\n        As a result of having demonstrated NF\u2010\u03baB as a downstream signal pathway of miR\u2010192, we next examined the role of NF\u2010\u03baB in miR\u2010192 mediated cell apoptosis, cell cycle and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. Curcumin was used to inhibit NF\u2010\u03baB activity, and p\u2010I\u03baB and total I\u03baB was measured. As shown in Figure\u00a06a, the expression level of p\u2010I\u03baB was markedly upregulated when A549 cells enforced expression of miR\u2010192 (DMSO\u2010miR\u2010192) compared to the negative control (DMSO\u2010NC), and P\u2010I\u03baB (p\u2010I\u03baB) enables NF\u2010\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus, and activates the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway. However, the effect of p\u2010I\u03baB upregulation induced by miR\u2010192 could be reversed under curcumin treatment. The IC50 values for cisplatin in A549 cells (DMSO\u2010miR\u2010192) was 14.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05), more than 3.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in A549 cells (DMSO\u2010NC). Whereas, there was no significant difference in the IC50 value for cisplatin between A549 cells treated with curcumin\u2010NC and A549 cells treated with curcumin\u2010miR\u2010192 (Figure\u00a06b).\n        \n          FIGURE 6\n          \n            Curcumin inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB activation, which reduces miR\u2010192\u2010induced resistance to cisplatin in A549 cells. (a) Western blot was used to analyse the expression of NF\u2010\u03baB after transfection in A549 cells, and cells were treated with or without 30\u00a0\u03bcmol/l curcumin for 6\u2009h before harvesting for western blot. (b) Sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin after transfection with miR\u2010192 mimic with or without curcumin. A549 cells plated in culture dishes were pretreated with curcumin for 24\u2009h, after which cisplatin was added to each well. Viability was measured by the CCK\u20108 assay 48\u2009h after cisplatin treatment. (c) Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometric (FCM) analysis 48\u2009h after curcumin treatment. (d) The apoptosis rate of A549 cells after transfection of miR\u2010192 mimics with or without curcumin. A549 cells plated in culture dishes were pretreated with curcumin for 24\u2009h, and then 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml cisplatin was added to each well. Apoptotic cells were detected by FCM 48\u2009h after cisplatin treatment. The data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 and **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with the viability of A549 cells at 0\u2009\u03bcmol/L curcumin\n          \n          \n        \n        Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis showed that inhibiting NF\u2010\u03baB blocked G1/S phase transition and induced apoptosis, which indicates that NF\u2010\u03baB might induce cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells by triggering G1/S phase transition and decreasing apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure\u00a06c and d). The same results were also obtained when comparing miR\u2010192\u2010treated with the vehicle group. There was no significant difference between the NC and vehicle groups. Our data show that miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance, inhibition of the G1/S phase transition and inhibition of apoptosis can be reversed by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB signal pathway. Considering the effects of NF\u2010\u03baB on cisplatin IC50 values for lung cancer cells, we conclude that miR\u2010192 /NKRF axis regulates cisplatin sensitivity in human lung adenocarcinoma cells via the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway.\nConclusions\n          MiR\u2010192 plays a crucial role in cisplatin\u2010resistance of lung cancer cells. Thus, MiR\u2010192 may represent a therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to cisplatin\u2010based chemotherapy in lung cancer.\nINTRODUCTION\n      Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and remains the leading cause of cancer\u2010related deaths, with high incidence and high recurrence rate. Although there has been an improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, the five\u2010year survival rate has still increased to 16.6%,\n1\n, \n2\n mainly because of the emergence of resistance during treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n3\n Cisplatin (DDP) is the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer. However, cisplatin resistance represents a primary obstacle in effective clinical treatment. Therefore, elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms which regulate cisplatin resistance in order to improve its therapeutic value in lung cancer is urgently required.\n      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are predicted to regulate the expression of up to one third of human protein\u2010coding genes, and are involved in diverse biological processes, including development,\n4\n differentiation,\n5\n apoptosis and cell proliferation.\n6\n, \n7\n Abnormal miRNAs expression might function as oncogenes or tumour\u2010suppressor genes,\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n which influence the occurrence and progression of various cancers. Several miRNAs have been reported to play an important role in resistance to chemotherapy. Fujita et al. revealed that ectopic expression of miR\u201034a attenuates chemoresistance to camptothecin by inducing apoptosis.\n12\n Furthermore, Hamano et al. demonstrated that miR\u2010200c induces chemoresistance in oesophageal cancer through the Akt pathway.\n13\n Additionally, Yu et al. determined that MiR\u201023a might contribute to chemoresistance against cisplatin in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. These studies suggest that certain miRNAs could be used as effective predictive markers for chemoresistance in various tumors. MiR\u2010192 has been used as a marker for tumour diagnosis,\n14\n invasion\n15\n and metastasis,\n16\n due to its involvement in cell proliferation,\n17\n cell cycle\n18\n and apoptosis.\n19\n Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that miR\u2010192 could influence 5\u2010fluorouracil resistance\n20\n and might be related to docetaxel resistance\n21\n in lung cancer cells. However, there are currently no studies on the effect of miR\u2010192 on lung cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and cisplatin resistance.\n      NF\u2010\u03baB is aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers and can cause chemotherapeutic resistance against certain antitumour agents. For example, NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitors boost cisplatin's antitumour capabilities in cisplatin\u2010resistant cell lines, inhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB can increase the efficacy of cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells,\n22\n and human epidermoid carcinoma KCP\u20104 cells are highly resistant to cisplatin owing to multiple changes in the NF\u2010\u03baB activation pathway and increased cisplatin efflux.\n23\n Constitutive NF\u2010\u03baB activation supports cancer cell survival and induces cisplatin resistance. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that MiRNAs, as an endogenous inhibitor of gene expression, play a significant role in the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB in cancer cells. For example, miR\u20109 can inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth by downregulating NF\u2010\u03baB1.\n24\n Furthermore, miR\u2010146 suppresses NF\u2010\u03baB activity in breast cancer cells, which results in reduced metastatic potential.\n25\n\n\n      In the present study, we demonstrated that miR\u2010192 was significantly upregulated in cisplatin resistance A549/DDP cells, miR\u2010192 induced cisplatin resistance through growth promotion, apoptosis inhibition and enhanced cell survival. Furthermore, we confirmed that NF\u2010\u03baB repressing factor (NKRF) was one of the target genes of miR\u2010192. MiR\u2010192 was able to promote cisplatin resistance through paralyzing the function of NKRF. In addition, we found that miR\u2010192 induced cisplatin resistance could be reversed by the NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor curcumin. These results suggest that /NKRF axis enhances cisplatin resistance through the NF\u2010\u03baB signal pathway.\nMaterials\n        Cisplatin and curcumin were purchased from Sigma, the cell counting kit\u20108 was purchased from DOjinDO (CCK\u20108, DOjinDO Laboratories), and the miRNeasy mini\u2010kit was purchased from Qiagen. MiR\u2010192 mimics and miR\u2010192 inhibitor were obtained from GenePharma. Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was purchased from Life technologies. Monoclonal antibody specific to NKRF, p\u2010\u03baB, I\u03baB, NF\u2010\u03baB p65, PARP\u20101, cIAP1, cIAP2, Bcl\u2010xl and XIAP were purchased from Abcam, cell signaling technology (Danvers) and Santa Cruz, respectively. pNF\u03baB\u2010luc was purchased from Beyotime, pMIR\u2010GLO dual\u2010luciferase miRNA target report vector and dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay system were purchased from Promega.\nCell culture and transfection\n        Human lung adenocarcinoma cisplatin\u2010sensitive cell line A549 (A549) and cisplatin\u2010resistance cell line A549/DDP (A549/DDP) were obtained from the cell bank of the Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenviroment (Tianjin, China). The biological characteristics and drug resistance of the cells have previously been demonstrated.\n26\n Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The A549/DDP cells were preserved in a 2\u2009\u03bcg/ml final concentration of cisplatin to sustain cisplatin resistance. All cell lines were grown under identical conditions. For transfection, cells were cultured to 40%\u201350% confluence and transfected with plasmids or miR\u2010192 mimics or miR\u2010192 inhibitor or control using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nNF\u2010\u03baB pathway contributes to enhanced miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance\n        Given that NKRF is an NF\u2010\u03baB repressing factor and miR\u2010192 could negatively regulate NKRF expression, we questioned whether NF\u2010\u03baB is involved in facilitating cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. The transcriptional activation of NF\u2010\u03baB was evaluated by dual luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Figure\u00a05a, overexpression of miR\u2010192 increased the luciferase activity in A549 cells, while silencing of miR\u2010192 decreased the luciferase activity in A549/DDP cells. Furthermore, NF\u2010\u03baB activation was also analysed by nuclear translocation assay in A549 and A549/DDP cells. Western blot results showed that forced expression of miR\u2010192 in A549 increased the nuclear protein level of NF\u2010\u03baB, decreased the cytoplasmic protein level of NF\u2010\u03baB, whereas the opposite was achieved in downexpression of MiR\u2010192 in A549/DDP (Figure\u00a05b).\n        \n          FIGURE 5\n          \n            NF\u2010\u03baB activity is increased by miR\u2010192.

RT\u2010PCR was carried out using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan). Reverse transcriptions were carried out in triplicate and analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900HT fast real\u2010time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantification values for each miRNA and gene were calculated by the 2\u2010\u0394\u0394Ct method using U6 and GAPDH as an internal reference, respectively.

After incubating for 24\u2009h to allow for cell attachment and recovery, A549 cells were treated with cisplatin at the concentration of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\u2009\u03bcg/ml and A549/DDP at the concentration of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\u2009ug/ml and incubated for 48\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. Then, 10\u2009\u03bcl of CCK\u20108 was added to each well and incubated for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were then analyzed on microplate readers (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices) at 450 and 630\u2009nm (background) to determine the absorbance of the samples.\nCell cycle analysis\n        Cell cycle analysis was determined using propidium iodide (PI) staining. In brief, the cells were fixed with 70% ice\u2010cold ethanol, followed by staining with freshly prepared nuclei staining buffer (0.1% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS, 200\u2009\u03bcg/ml of RNaseA, and 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml of PI) for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Cell\u2010cycle histograms were generated using fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting analysis. The percentage of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were counted and compared.\nApoptosis analysis\n        Cell apoptosis was detected by FITC Annexin V staining. First, the cells were harvested and washed with ice\u2010cold phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), and then subjected to the FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen) for staining. Finally, the cells were analyzed using a FACScan instrument (Beckman Coulter) and the data were measured using WinMDI 2.9.\nPlasmids and luciferase assay\n        For the miR\u2010192\u2010target analysis, two fragments of NKRF\u2010WT or NKRF\u2010Mut were cloned into the downstream of the pMIR\u2010GLO dual luciferase miRNA target vector according to protocol. pNF\u03baB\u2010luc vector was purchased from Beyotime which contained several \u03baB sites reflecting the transcriptional activity of NF\u2010\u03baB. In a 48\u2010well plate format, a final concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of reporter plasmid DNA and 100\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 mimics or 100\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 inhibitor mixed in 250\u2009\u03bcl of serum\u2010free medium were used for each transfection. In the cotransfection system, 50\u2009ng pRL\u2010SV40 reporter plasmids, 100\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 mimics or 200\u2009nmol/l of miR\u2010192 inhibitor and 250\u2009ng reporter plasmid DNA were added. At 48\u2009h post\u2010transfection, luciferase activities using the dual\u2010luciferase assay system were measured (Promega).\nWestern blotting\n        Cells were lysed on ice for 30\u2009min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer which included protease inhibitors (Beyotime) and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 4\u00b0C, 12000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min. The total proteins were resolved on 8%\u201315% gradient SDS\u2010polacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) filtration membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h in 5% skim milk in TBST and with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with appropriate HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibody at optimized concentration. The densitometry of Western blot results was measured using ImageJ software.\nStatistical analysis\n        The data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Two\u2010tailed Student's t\u2010test was used to determine the significant differences between the control and treatment groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 20.0 (SPSS, IBM) software and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\nInhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB reverses miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells\n        As a result of having demonstrated NF\u2010\u03baB as a downstream signal pathway of miR\u2010192, we next examined the role of NF\u2010\u03baB in miR\u2010192 mediated cell apoptosis, cell cycle and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. Curcumin was used to inhibit NF\u2010\u03baB activity, and p\u2010I\u03baB and total I\u03baB was measured. As shown in Figure\u00a06a, the expression level of p\u2010I\u03baB was markedly upregulated when A549 cells enforced expression of miR\u2010192 (DMSO\u2010miR\u2010192) compared to the negative control (DMSO\u2010NC), and P\u2010I\u03baB (p\u2010I\u03baB) enables NF\u2010\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus, and activates the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway. However, the effect of p\u2010I\u03baB upregulation induced by miR\u2010192 could be reversed under curcumin treatment. The IC50 values for cisplatin in A549 cells (DMSO\u2010miR\u2010192) was 14.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05), more than 3.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009\u03bcg/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in A549 cells (DMSO\u2010NC). Whereas, there was no significant difference in the IC50 value for cisplatin between A549 cells treated with curcumin\u2010NC and A549 cells treated with curcumin\u2010miR\u2010192 (Figure\u00a06b).\n        \n          FIGURE 6\n          \n            Curcumin inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB activation, which reduces miR\u2010192\u2010induced resistance to cisplatin in A549 cells. (a) Western blot was used to analyse the expression of NF\u2010\u03baB after transfection in A549 cells, and cells were treated with or without 30\u00a0\u03bcmol/l curcumin for 6\u2009h before harvesting for western blot. (b) Sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin after transfection with miR\u2010192 mimic with or without curcumin. A549 cells plated in culture dishes were pretreated with curcumin for 24\u2009h, after which cisplatin was added to each well. Viability was measured by the CCK\u20108 assay 48\u2009h after cisplatin treatment. (c) Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometric (FCM) analysis 48\u2009h after curcumin treatment. (d) The apoptosis rate of A549 cells after transfection of miR\u2010192 mimics with or without curcumin. A549 cells plated in culture dishes were pretreated with curcumin for 24\u2009h, and then 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml cisplatin was added to each well. Apoptotic cells were detected by FCM 48\u2009h after cisplatin treatment. The data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 and **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with the viability of A549 cells at 0\u2009\u03bcmol/L curcumin\n          \n          \n        \n        Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis showed that inhibiting NF\u2010\u03baB blocked G1/S phase transition and induced apoptosis, which indicates that NF\u2010\u03baB might induce cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells by triggering G1/S phase transition and decreasing apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure\u00a06c and d). The same results were also obtained when comparing miR\u2010192\u2010treated with the vehicle group. There was no significant difference between the NC and vehicle groups. Our data show that miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance, inhibition of the G1/S phase transition and inhibition of apoptosis can be reversed by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB signal pathway. Considering the effects of NF\u2010\u03baB on cisplatin IC50 values for lung cancer cells, we conclude that miR\u2010192 /NKRF axis regulates cisplatin sensitivity in human lung adenocarcinoma cells via the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway.\nDISCUSSION\n      Cisplatin is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC treatment. Unfortunately, due to the majority of tumors acquiring drug resistance, most patients with advanced NSCLC will eventually relapse and die because of acquired drug resistance. Therefore cisplatin resistance is a major clinical challenge. Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs are involved in modulating sensitivity and resistance to anticancer drugs. However, the mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance by miRNAs have not yet been clearly identified.\n      In our study, we first explored aberrantly expressed miRNAs in A549 and cisplatin\u2010resistant A549/DDP cells. Microarray data revealed that a total of 107 microRNAs in A549 cells showed at least a 2.0\u2010fold change in expression level compared with that in parental A549/DDP cells. Among these miRNAs, eight miRNAs (miR\u201098, 195, 193a, 194, 192, 3613, 183 and 3653) were significantly upregulated in the A549/DDP cell line. Specially, miR\u2010192 has been found to be one of the most upregulated miRNAs in the A549/DDP cell line compared with that of the parental A549 cells. Therefore, we aim to focus on miR\u2010192 in future studies.\n      MiR\u2010192 has been reported to be upregulated in multiple cancer types including prostate cancer,\n28\n ovarian cancer,\n29\n esophageal cancer,\n30\n cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)\n31\n and neuroblastoma (NB).\n32\n The biological effects of miR\u2010192 in these cancers have been partially identified; miR\u2010192 could enhance cell proliferation and migration, reduce cell apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase by regulating key factors in this progress such as smad\u2010interacting protein 1 (SIP1) and Dicer.\n12\n Also, the prognostic values of miR\u2010192 in human cancers have been investigated. Feinberg\u2010Gorenshtein et al. showed that miR\u2010192 upregulation was associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis in cervical cancer and could be identified as an independent prognostic marker for relapse in neuroblastoma patients. MiR\u2010192 overexpression in CCA patients was found to be significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. Additionally, in drug resistance, miR\u2010192 was reported to be associated with docetaxel\u2010resistant in human non\u2010small cell lung carcinoma cells. Here, we demonstrated that miR\u2010192 is upregulated in A549/DDP cells and is involved in cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells.\n      Next, we investigated the role of miR\u2010192 in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. Our data showed that miR\u2010192 highly reduced cisplatin\u2010induced apoptosis and enhanced cell growth by boosting G1/S phase transition in vitro. Dysregulation of the cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis are underlying mechanisms of chemoresistance. E2F3 has been reported to increase cellular proliferation as a transcriptional activator through the G1/S transitions and its overexpression contributes to docetaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells.\n33\n, \n34\n Therefore, our data suggested that the increased expression of miR\u2010192 may contribute to the apoptosis and proliferation of cancer cells and consequently confer cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells.\n      To further explore the molecular mechanisms by which miR\u2010192 exerts its function, the determination of its functional target gene is essential. We characterized NKRF as a functional target of miR\u2010192 by luciferase reporter gene assays and Western blot analysis, respectively. NKRF is abundant in many human cell lines and adult tissues. In tumorgenesis, Lu et al. found that NKRF was downregulated in pancreatic tumours and inhibited cell proliferation and tumor formation in vitro and in vivo. NKRF is primarily localised in the nucleolus and it contains a separable and position\u2010independent NF\u2010\u03baB \u2010repression domain.\n35\n Furthermore, NKRF interacts directly with NF\u2010\u03baB proteins to actively repress NF\u2010\u03baB activity. We therefore speculated that the NF\u2010\u03baB pathways might be responsible for miR\u2010192\u2010modulated cisplatin resistance.\n      NF\u2010\u03baB is a transcription factor composed of Rel family proteins, including p65(RelA), p50(NF\u2010\u03baB1), p52 (NF\u2010\u03baB2), cRel and RelB, which associate in various heterodimeric and homodimeric combinations.\n36\n The p65\u2013p50 heterodimer, known as classical NF\u2010\u03baB, is present in its inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory protein I\u2010\u03baB. Signal activation by phosphorylation and degradation of I\u2010\u03baBs enables NF\u2010\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and bind to \u03baB sites, regulating the expression of many genes. NF\u2010\u03baB is frequently activated in various types of tumors and promotes cancer development and chemoresistance. NF\u2010\u03baB also has a crucial role in apoptosis and the cell cycle of cancer cells by regulating key genes in these processes, such as p53 and cyclinD1. Our data clearly suggest that the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. This conclusion is based on the following evidence. First, luciferase activity assay demonstrated that miR\u2010192 mimic significantly upregulated NF\u2010\u03baB transcriptional activation, whereas miR\u2010192 inhibitor significantly downregulated the transcriptional activation of NF\u2010\u03baB. Second, the nuclear translocation assay indicated that A549 and A549/DDP cells transfected with miR\u2010192 mimics, nuclear NF\u2010\u03baB levels increased, whereas cytoplasmic NF\u2010\u03baB levels decreased. Third, the expression level of cIAP1, cIAP2, Bcl\u2010xl and XIAP, downstream targets of NF\u2010\u03baB, was regulated by miR\u2010192. These four genes have been reported to be associated with chemoresistance of cancers.\n27\n Fourth, inhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB activation by an inhibitor of I\u2010\u03baB kinase has been shown to decrease NF\u2010\u03baB activation, and partially reverse the effect of miR\u2010192 on cell cycle, apoptosis and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. These data provide experimental evidence that NKRF is directly targeted and negatively regulated by miR\u2010192, which results in NF\u2010\u03baB activation and cisplatin resistance in A549 cells.\n      In conclusion, our study establishes a functional link between miR\u2010192 and NKRF in lung cancer cells, and shows that miR\u2010192 could promote cisplatin resistance via regulating G1/S transition and apoptosis by targeting NKRF. Furthermore, the NF\u2010\u03baB signal pathway was activated by miR\u2010192 and involved in miR\u2010192\u2010induced cisplatin resistance. Our data provides a new insight into the mechanism responsible for cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. Therefore, targeting miR\u2010192 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in lung cancer cisplatin resistance in the future.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.",
