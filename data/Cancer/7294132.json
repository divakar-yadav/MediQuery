    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      According to cancer statistics published in 2018, lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer\u2010associated morbidity and mortality worldwide.\n1\n The most common cause of mortality in advanced lung cancer patients is metastasis, especially metastasis to the brain. Without treatment, the median overall survival of lung cancer patients with brain metastasis is only 1\u20102\u00a0months.\n2\n Therefore, exploring possible underlying molecular mechanisms involved with cancer metastasis, and developing new predictive targets and therapeutic strategies to suppress metastasis, seems to be of import for achieving clinical benefits in cancer patients.\n      Metastasis is closely associated with the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT),\n3\n which endows cancer cells with enhanced migratory and invasive potential as well as phenotypic markers including E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109, MMP\u20101 and MMP\u20102.\n4\n, \n5\n\n\n      MicroRNAs are non\u2010coding RNAs, 19\u201022 nucleotides in length, which are closely associated with cancer progression, including metastasis. Song et al\n\n6\n found that miR\u201026a\u20105p promoted lung cancer metastasis. Jiang et al\n\n7\n demonstrated that miR\u201019a\u20103p potentiates hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. Studies of breast cancer and cervical cancer have shown that microRNAs may foster metastasis by enhancing migratory and invasive abilities and altering the expression of EMT\u2010associated proteins such as E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin and vimentin.\n8\n, \n9\n\n\n      Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (diameter 30\u2010150\u00a0nm) that are secreted by all living cells.\n10\n They express specific surface markers, such as CD63, CD81 and Tsg101, and contain several types of bioactive materials, including microRNA, protein and DNA.\n11\n Recent reports suggest that tumour microenvironment\u2010derived cells such as cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and mast cells may communicate with cancer cells and enhance their metastatic ability through the transfer of special microRNA encapsulated in exosomes.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n The metastatic potential of cancer cells may therefore be regulated by other types of cells in the tumour microenvironment through the transfer of exosomes carrying pro\u2010metastatic microRNAs.\n      Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of heterogeneous cells found in tumour tissue or cultured cell lines. Previous studies have suggested that lung CSCs may be isolated and enriched from surgically resected tumour tissue or lung cancer cell lines such as A549, PC\u20109 and H460.\n15\n, \n16\n These cells display obvious morphological differences from their parental lung cancer cells and express a stemness phenotype that includes enhanced ability for self\u2010renewal, resistance to chemo/radiotherapy, high expression of stemness\u2010associated markers such as CD133, ALDH1, Sox2 and Nanog, and increased metastatic potential. Due to these specific features, lung CSCs were considered to be the main mediators of lung cancer metastasis and recurrence.\n17\n One recent study of renal carcinoma showed that CSC\u2010derived exosomes promoted EMT in renal carcinoma cells by transferring miR\u201019b\u20103p.\n18\n As one of the most important and essential components of the tumour microenvironment, whether lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes carrying special microRNA involves in the pro\u2010metastatic phenotype of lung cancer cells and its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.\n      In the present study, we identified and enriched lung CSCs from parental A549 cells and explored the functional role of lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes in regulation of the pro\u2010metastatic phenotype of lung cancer cells. We also investigated the underlying molecular mechanism.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Cell culture\n        Lung cancer cell lines including A549, NCI\u2010H1703 and human normal lung epithelial cell line BEAS\u20102B were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The A549 and BEAS\u20102B cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Hyclone). The NCI\u2010H1703 cell line was cultured in RPMI\u20101640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), streptomycin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and penicillin (100\u00a0U/mL). Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n        To generate suspended and stem\u2010like sphere\u2010growing cells, A549 cells were dissociated into single cells and seeded onto 6\u2010well ultra\u2010low attachment plates (Corning) at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0cells/well. Cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF, 10\u00a0ng/mL; Sigma), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 10\u00a0ng/mL; Sigma) and insulin (4\u00a0U/I; Sigma) for 12\u00a0days. After primary tumour spheres reached approximately 50\u2010100\u00a0\u03bcm/sphere, the spheres were dissociated with Accutase (Invitrogen). The single cells obtained were cultured for another 12\u00a0days until secondary spheres had formed. After 5 passages, the spheres were collected, and characterization experiments were performed.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Cell transfection with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic, miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor, FGFRL1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1\u2010FGFRL1\n        MiR\u2010210\u20103p mimic, miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor and corresponding negative controls (miR\u2010NC and miR\u2010inhibitor NC, respectively) were purchased from GenePharma. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human FGFRL1 mRNA, its negative control siRNA and pcDNA3.1\u2010FGFRL1 as well as pcDNA3.1 blank vector were also purchased from GenePharma. Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol under serum\u2010free conditions. After 6\u201012\u00a0h of transfection, the liquid was abandoned and replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated for another 24 or 48\u00a0h. Cells were then collected, and transfection efficiency was verified by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis or Western blot.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Tumour sphere formation\n        Single cells derived from tumour spheres or parental A549 cells were seeded in 96\u2010well ultra\u2010low plates at a density of 50 or 100 cells per well, respectively. After 12\u00a0days of non\u2010adhesive culture, the number of spheres with >50\u00a0\u00b5m/sphere was counted, and representative morphology was captured under light microscopy (Leica). Sphere\u2010forming efficiency (SFE) was calculated as the number of spheres formed divided by the initial number of single cells plated and expressed as a percentage.\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Quantitative real\u2010time PCR\n        Total RNA from cells or exosomes was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The primer sequences for ALDH1, Sox2, Nanog, CD133, BDNF, E2F3, FGFRL1, KCMF1, NDUFA4, GAPDH, miR\u2010210\u20103p and U6 were designed and synthesized by GenePharma. The primer sequences are listed in Table\u00a01. RNAs were reverse\u2010transcribed with PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (Takara) or microRNA first\u2010strand cDNA synthesis (Sangon Biotech); qPCR analysis was performed with the SYBR Green Detection Kit (Takara) or the MicroRNA qPCR Kit (SYBR Green Method) (Sangon Biotech). All processes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAPDH and U6 were used as endogenous controls.\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Primer sequences\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                Primer\n                Sequence (5\u2019\u20103\u2019)\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                CD133\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TCTTGACCGACTGAGACCCAAC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010ACTTGATGGATGCACCAAGCAC\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                ALDH1\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TTGCTATGGCGTGGTAAGT\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010GACTTACCTGTCCTACTCA\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                Nanog\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CTCGCTGATTAGGCTCCAAC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TTCAGTCTGGACACTGGCTG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                Sox2\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CGATGCCGACAAGAAAACTT\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010CAAACTTCCTGCAAAGCTCC\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                BDNF\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CCTCTCAGCCTCCAGCGTTG\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TGCTCTTGCTCACTCACACT\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                E2F3\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010AAGAAATTAGATGAACTGATCCAAAGC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TAACATAAGCTAACCTTTGATTCTCTGA\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                FGFRL1\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TGTGAACACAACGGTGGACT\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010GGGCAACACCACAAACTTCT\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                KCMF1\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TGAGACGTTCTGCAGGAGGAC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TTGTGTTAGTACGCCGGGTTG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                NDUFA4\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010AAGCATCCGAGCTTGATCCC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TGGGACCCAGTTTGTTCCAG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                GAPDH\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010GACCTGACCTGCCGTCTA\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010AGGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGT\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                miR\u2010210\u20103p\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010GGACTAGGTCATCTGCATACG\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010CCGAATGATGTCGCTTACGAC\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                U6\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010AACGCTTCACGAATTTG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        2.5\n        Immunofluorescent staining assay\n        Tumour spheres were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min before they were embedded in low\u2010melting point agarose for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The coagulated agarose was embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek). Frozen blocks were cut into section of 5\u2010\u00b5m thickness. A549 cells were plated onto Matrigel\u2010coated glass coverslips before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min at room temperature, followed by washes in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS). All cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 for 15\u00a0min at room temperature and blocked in 5% BSA for 30\u00a0min before incubation with CD133 and ALDH1 (1:300, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., LTD). Sections were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2103 and then incubated with fluorescence\u2010tagged mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies. DAPI (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was used for nuclear staining. Fluorescence images were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Leica).\n      \n      \n        2.6\n        Western blot analysis\n        Cells or exosomes were treated with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime Biotechnology). Samples containing 20\u00a0\u03bcg protein were separated and transferred to PVDF membranes, and then blocked in 5% non\u2010fat milk at room temperature for 1\u00a0h. The PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for rabbit anti\u2010CD133, anti\u2010Nanog, anti\u2010Sox2, anti\u2010ALDH1, anti\u2010FGFRL1 and anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin (1:500, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., LTD); rabbit anti\u2010CD63, rabbit anti\u2010TSG101 and rabbit anti\u2010CD81 (1:500, Abcam); and rabbit anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin, anti\u2010N\u2010cadherin, anti\u2010vimentin, anti\u2010MMP\u20109 and anti\u2010MMP\u20101 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Antibody recognition was performed with peroxidase\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG (H\u00a0+\u00a0L) secondary antibody (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology Co., LTD), which was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Protein levels were detected with chemiluminescent HRP substrate and a Western blot analysis system (Universal Hood II, Bio\u2010Rad).\n      \n      \n        2.7\n        Tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice\n        To evaluate tumorigenicity, approximately 103, 104, 105 and 106 of parental A549 cells and 102, 103, 104 and 105 of tumour sphere\u2010derived cells were suspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl PBS and then inoculated into the armpits of nude mice (five weeks old, BALB/C\u2010nu/nu, female, n\u00a0=\u00a03). Five weeks after inoculation, mice were killed, and tumour tissues were collected. Animals were purchased from Hua Fu Kang Bioscience Incorporated Company (Beijing, China) and maintained under standard conditions, according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the authenticated animal protocols of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University.\n      \n      \n        2.8\n        Exosome isolation and quantification\n        For lung cancer cell culture, the medium was changed to RMPI\u20101640 or DMEM containing 10% exosome\u2010free FBS (System Biosciences) for 48\u00a0h, until cells reached 90% confluency and were subsequently collected. For tumour spheres, medium was collected from supernatant with approximately 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/mL. After using a 0.22\u2010\u03bcm filter (Millipore) to remove cellular debris, the medium obtained was ultra centrifuged at 120\u00a0000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g, at 4\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min, to pellet the exosomes. The supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with PBS, ultracentrifuged and finally resuspended again in ice\u2010cold PBS for further analysis. The concentration of exosomes was determined by Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n      \n      \n        2.9\n        Transmission electron microscopy\n        The purified exosomes were prepared by mixing with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde and deposited on Formvar carbon\u2010coated copper grids. Grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 15\u00a0min, air\u2010dried and then observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI Tecnai 20; Philips).\n      \n      \n        2.10\n        Nanoparticle tracking analysis\n        To measure the size of the purified exosomes, they were resuspended in PBS. NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Instruments) nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) software was then used to visualize and measure particle size.\n      \n      \n        2.11\n        PKH26 labelling of exosomes\n        To observe the interaction between exosomes and lung cancer cells, exosomes were labelled with PKH26 (a membrane fluorescence dye that is red in colour) (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). After co\u2010incubation with PKH26\u2010labelled exosomes for 6\u00a0h, lung cancer cells were counterstained with DAPI. Staining patterns were visualized with an inverted fluorescence microscope linked to a camera (Leica).\n      \n      \n        2.12\n        Detection of miR\u2010210\u20103p transfer\n        Tumour spheres were transiently transfected with fluorescein amidite (FAM)\u2010labelled miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic (GenePharma) with Lipofectamine 3000. After transfection for 48\u00a0h, the culture medium was collected to extract exosomes, as described above. Exosomes isolated from the culture medium of tumour spheres transfected with FAM\u2010labelled miR\u2010210\u20103p were labelled with Dil (Invitrogen) and then added to the lung cancer cell culture. After incubation for 24\u00a0h, cells were counterstained with DAPI. Images were visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope linked to a camera (Leica, Japan).\n      \n      \n        2.13\n        MTT assay\n        Lung cancer cells were seeded in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of medium/well (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0cells per well) in 96\u2010well plates. After co\u2010incubation with various concentrations of exosomes (0, 10, 20, 40 or 80\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5\u00a0days, 10\u00a0\u03bcL of MTT was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 4\u00a0h. Then, 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 10% SDS/0.01\u00a0N HCL was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight to dissolve the formazan. Absorbance was measured at 450\u00a0nm.\n      \n      \n        2.14\n        Cell migration assay\n        A wound\u2010healing assay was performed to assess migratory ability under various conditions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6\u2010well plates to create a confluent monolayer. A scratch wound was made with a sterile pipette tip, after which plates were incubated for 24 or 48\u00a0h with or without exosomes. Images were captured under a camera equipped with a light microscope (Leica).\n      \n      \n        2.15\n        Transwell assay\n        Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using Transwell chambers (8\u2010\u03bcm pore size; Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) with or without Matrigel (BD Biosciences) matrix. In brief, cells were added to the upper chamber; the bottom chamber was filled with complete medium. After 48\u00a0h, the cells on the top surface of the membrane were mechanically removed using a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated towards or penetrated the membrane were stained with a 4\u00a0g/L crystal violet solution. The number of cells was counted under an inverted light microscope linked to a camera (Leica).\n      \n      \n        2.16\n        Dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay\n        The amplified FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010WT and corresponding FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010MUT were cloned into pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega Corporation). Lung cancer cells were seeded onto 96\u2010well plates over a 24\u2010h period. Lung cancer cells were transfected with FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010WT and miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic or FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010MUT and miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic using Lipofectamine 3000. After 48\u00a0h, cells were harvested, and the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega Corporation) was used to measure relative differences in luciferase activity.\n      \n      \n        2.17\n        Statistical analysis\n        Differences were examined using Student's t test or one\u2010way analysis of variance. The data are presented as means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Values of P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 software (IBM).\n2.1\n        Cell culture\n        Lung cancer cell lines including A549, NCI\u2010H1703 and human normal lung epithelial cell line BEAS\u20102B were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The A549 and BEAS\u20102B cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Hyclone). The NCI\u2010H1703 cell line was cultured in RPMI\u20101640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), streptomycin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and penicillin (100\u00a0U/mL). Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n        To generate suspended and stem\u2010like sphere\u2010growing cells, A549 cells were dissociated into single cells and seeded onto 6\u2010well ultra\u2010low attachment plates (Corning) at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0cells/well. Cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF, 10\u00a0ng/mL; Sigma), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 10\u00a0ng/mL; Sigma) and insulin (4\u00a0U/I; Sigma) for 12\u00a0days. After primary tumour spheres reached approximately 50\u2010100\u00a0\u03bcm/sphere, the spheres were dissociated with Accutase (Invitrogen). The single cells obtained were cultured for another 12\u00a0days until secondary spheres had formed. After 5 passages, the spheres were collected, and characterization experiments were performed.\n2.2\n        Cell transfection with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic, miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor, FGFRL1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1\u2010FGFRL1\n        MiR\u2010210\u20103p mimic, miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor and corresponding negative controls (miR\u2010NC and miR\u2010inhibitor NC, respectively) were purchased from GenePharma. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human FGFRL1 mRNA, its negative control siRNA and pcDNA3.1\u2010FGFRL1 as well as pcDNA3.1 blank vector were also purchased from GenePharma. Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol under serum\u2010free conditions. After 6\u201012\u00a0h of transfection, the liquid was abandoned and replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated for another 24 or 48\u00a0h. Cells were then collected, and transfection efficiency was verified by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis or Western blot.\n2.3\n        Tumour sphere formation\n        Single cells derived from tumour spheres or parental A549 cells were seeded in 96\u2010well ultra\u2010low plates at a density of 50 or 100 cells per well, respectively. After 12\u00a0days of non\u2010adhesive culture, the number of spheres with >50\u00a0\u00b5m/sphere was counted, and representative morphology was captured under light microscopy (Leica). Sphere\u2010forming efficiency (SFE) was calculated as the number of spheres formed divided by the initial number of single cells plated and expressed as a percentage.\n2.4\n        Quantitative real\u2010time PCR\n        Total RNA from cells or exosomes was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The primer sequences for ALDH1, Sox2, Nanog, CD133, BDNF, E2F3, FGFRL1, KCMF1, NDUFA4, GAPDH, miR\u2010210\u20103p and U6 were designed and synthesized by GenePharma. The primer sequences are listed in Table\u00a01. RNAs were reverse\u2010transcribed with PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (Takara) or microRNA first\u2010strand cDNA synthesis (Sangon Biotech); qPCR analysis was performed with the SYBR Green Detection Kit (Takara) or the MicroRNA qPCR Kit (SYBR Green Method) (Sangon Biotech). All processes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAPDH and U6 were used as endogenous controls.\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Primer sequences\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                Primer\n                Sequence (5\u2019\u20103\u2019)\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                CD133\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TCTTGACCGACTGAGACCCAAC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010ACTTGATGGATGCACCAAGCAC\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                ALDH1\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TTGCTATGGCGTGGTAAGT\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010GACTTACCTGTCCTACTCA\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                Nanog\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CTCGCTGATTAGGCTCCAAC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TTCAGTCTGGACACTGGCTG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                Sox2\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CGATGCCGACAAGAAAACTT\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010CAAACTTCCTGCAAAGCTCC\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                BDNF\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CCTCTCAGCCTCCAGCGTTG\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TGCTCTTGCTCACTCACACT\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                E2F3\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010AAGAAATTAGATGAACTGATCCAAAGC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TAACATAAGCTAACCTTTGATTCTCTGA\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                FGFRL1\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TGTGAACACAACGGTGGACT\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010GGGCAACACCACAAACTTCT\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                KCMF1\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010TGAGACGTTCTGCAGGAGGAC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TTGTGTTAGTACGCCGGGTTG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                NDUFA4\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010AAGCATCCGAGCTTGATCCC\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010TGGGACCCAGTTTGTTCCAG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                GAPDH\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010GACCTGACCTGCCGTCTA\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010AGGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGT\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                miR\u2010210\u20103p\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010GGACTAGGTCATCTGCATACG\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010CCGAATGATGTCGCTTACGAC\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n              \n                U6\n                \nForward 5\u2019\u2010CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA\u20103\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2010AACGCTTCACGAATTTG\u20103\u2019\n\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n2.5\n        Immunofluorescent staining assay\n        Tumour spheres were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min before they were embedded in low\u2010melting point agarose for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The coagulated agarose was embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek). Frozen blocks were cut into section of 5\u2010\u00b5m thickness. A549 cells were plated onto Matrigel\u2010coated glass coverslips before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min at room temperature, followed by washes in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS). All cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 for 15\u00a0min at room temperature and blocked in 5% BSA for 30\u00a0min before incubation with CD133 and ALDH1 (1:300, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., LTD). Sections were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2103 and then incubated with fluorescence\u2010tagged mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies. DAPI (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was used for nuclear staining. Fluorescence images were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Leica).\n2.6\n        Western blot analysis\n        Cells or exosomes were treated with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime Biotechnology). Samples containing 20\u00a0\u03bcg protein were separated and transferred to PVDF membranes, and then blocked in 5% non\u2010fat milk at room temperature for 1\u00a0h. The PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for rabbit anti\u2010CD133, anti\u2010Nanog, anti\u2010Sox2, anti\u2010ALDH1, anti\u2010FGFRL1 and anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin (1:500, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., LTD); rabbit anti\u2010CD63, rabbit anti\u2010TSG101 and rabbit anti\u2010CD81 (1:500, Abcam); and rabbit anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin, anti\u2010N\u2010cadherin, anti\u2010vimentin, anti\u2010MMP\u20109 and anti\u2010MMP\u20101 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Antibody recognition was performed with peroxidase\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG (H\u00a0+\u00a0L) secondary antibody (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology Co., LTD), which was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Protein levels were detected with chemiluminescent HRP substrate and a Western blot analysis system (Universal Hood II, Bio\u2010Rad).\n2.7\n        Tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice\n        To evaluate tumorigenicity, approximately 103, 104, 105 and 106 of parental A549 cells and 102, 103, 104 and 105 of tumour sphere\u2010derived cells were suspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl PBS and then inoculated into the armpits of nude mice (five weeks old, BALB/C\u2010nu/nu, female, n\u00a0=\u00a03). Five weeks after inoculation, mice were killed, and tumour tissues were collected. Animals were purchased from Hua Fu Kang Bioscience Incorporated Company (Beijing, China) and maintained under standard conditions, according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the authenticated animal protocols of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University.\n2.8\n        Exosome isolation and quantification\n        For lung cancer cell culture, the medium was changed to RMPI\u20101640 or DMEM containing 10% exosome\u2010free FBS (System Biosciences) for 48\u00a0h, until cells reached 90% confluency and were subsequently collected. For tumour spheres, medium was collected from supernatant with approximately 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/mL. After using a 0.22\u2010\u03bcm filter (Millipore) to remove cellular debris, the medium obtained was ultra centrifuged at 120\u00a0000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g, at 4\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min, to pellet the exosomes. The supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with PBS, ultracentrifuged and finally resuspended again in ice\u2010cold PBS for further analysis. The concentration of exosomes was determined by Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n2.9\n        Transmission electron microscopy\n        The purified exosomes were prepared by mixing with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde and deposited on Formvar carbon\u2010coated copper grids. Grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 15\u00a0min, air\u2010dried and then observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI Tecnai 20; Philips).\n2.10\n        Nanoparticle tracking analysis\n        To measure the size of the purified exosomes, they were resuspended in PBS. NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Instruments) nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) software was then used to visualize and measure particle size.\n2.11\n        PKH26 labelling of exosomes\n        To observe the interaction between exosomes and lung cancer cells, exosomes were labelled with PKH26 (a membrane fluorescence dye that is red in colour) (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). After co\u2010incubation with PKH26\u2010labelled exosomes for 6\u00a0h, lung cancer cells were counterstained with DAPI. Staining patterns were visualized with an inverted fluorescence microscope linked to a camera (Leica).\n2.12\n        Detection of miR\u2010210\u20103p transfer\n        Tumour spheres were transiently transfected with fluorescein amidite (FAM)\u2010labelled miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic (GenePharma) with Lipofectamine 3000. After transfection for 48\u00a0h, the culture medium was collected to extract exosomes, as described above. Exosomes isolated from the culture medium of tumour spheres transfected with FAM\u2010labelled miR\u2010210\u20103p were labelled with Dil (Invitrogen) and then added to the lung cancer cell culture. After incubation for 24\u00a0h, cells were counterstained with DAPI. Images were visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope linked to a camera (Leica, Japan).\n2.13\n        MTT assay\n        Lung cancer cells were seeded in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of medium/well (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0cells per well) in 96\u2010well plates. After co\u2010incubation with various concentrations of exosomes (0, 10, 20, 40 or 80\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5\u00a0days, 10\u00a0\u03bcL of MTT was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 4\u00a0h. Then, 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 10% SDS/0.01\u00a0N HCL was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight to dissolve the formazan. Absorbance was measured at 450\u00a0nm.\n2.14\n        Cell migration assay\n        A wound\u2010healing assay was performed to assess migratory ability under various conditions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6\u2010well plates to create a confluent monolayer. A scratch wound was made with a sterile pipette tip, after which plates were incubated for 24 or 48\u00a0h with or without exosomes. Images were captured under a camera equipped with a light microscope (Leica).\n2.15\n        Transwell assay\n        Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using Transwell chambers (8\u2010\u03bcm pore size; Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) with or without Matrigel (BD Biosciences) matrix. In brief, cells were added to the upper chamber; the bottom chamber was filled with complete medium. After 48\u00a0h, the cells on the top surface of the membrane were mechanically removed using a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated towards or penetrated the membrane were stained with a 4\u00a0g/L crystal violet solution. The number of cells was counted under an inverted light microscope linked to a camera (Leica).\n2.16\n        Dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay\n        The amplified FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010WT and corresponding FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010MUT were cloned into pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega Corporation). Lung cancer cells were seeded onto 96\u2010well plates over a 24\u2010h period. Lung cancer cells were transfected with FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010WT and miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic or FGFRL1\u20103\u2019\u2010UTR\u2010MUT and miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic using Lipofectamine 3000. After 48\u00a0h, cells were harvested, and the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega Corporation) was used to measure relative differences in luciferase activity.\n2.17\n        Statistical analysis\n        Differences were examined using Student's t test or one\u2010way analysis of variance. The data are presented as means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Values of P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 software (IBM).\n3\n      RESULTS\n      \n        3.1\n        Identifying stemness phenotype in A549 cell\u2010derived tumour spheres\n        Self\u2010renewal ability is the most important characteristics of CSCs. As shown in Figure 1A, through limiting dilution analysis, we demonstrated that the SFE of tumour sphere\u2010derived cells was significantly increased, compared to that of parental A549 cells. Indeed, single cells derived from tumour spheres were able to form new spheres, whereas parental A549 cells had no such effect. Most A549 cells present in the non\u2010adhesive culture appeared to be dead (Figure 1B). When we evaluated tumorigenesis in vivo, we found that inoculation with 102, 103, 104 or 105 tumour spheres generated tumours in 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 and 3/3 of inoculations, respectively. Inoculation with 103, 104, 105 and 106 of parental A549 cells generated tumours in 0/3, 0/3, 0/3 and 2/3 of inoculations (Figure 1C). Stemness\u2010associated markers including ALDH1, Sox2, Nanog and CD133 were closely involved with maintenance of the stemness phenotype in lung CSCs. Through qPCR and Western blot analysis, we verified that the expression levels of these markers were significantly higher in tumour spheres than in parental A549 cells (Figure 1D\u2010E). Immunofluorescent staining analysis further revealed that the intensity of ALDH1 and CD133 fluorescence was higher in tumour spheres, compared to parental A549 cells (Figure 1F). CSCs acquire enhanced metastatic ability during the EMT. The results of the Transwell assays performed in this study showed that the number of migrated or invaded cells derived from tumour spheres was greatly increased, compared to the number of migrated or invaded cells derived from parental A549 cells (Figure 1G\u2010H). Western blot analysis of tumour spheres further showed that the expression of EMT\u2010associated proteins including N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 was up\u2010regulated, whereas E\u2010cadherin expression was down\u2010regulated (Figure 1I). These results suggest that tumour spheres derived from parental A549 cells expressed the stemness phenotype. These cells appeared to have dedifferentiated into lung CSCs.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Identification of stemness phenotype in tumour spheres derived from parental A549 cells.

As shown in Figure 2, the characteristics of exosomes were verified through TEM, NTA and Western blot analysis. TEM observation revealed that most vesicles had a typical cup\u2010shaped morphology (Figure 2A). NTA analysis showed that the average diameter of exosomes ranged from 30 to 150\u00a0nm (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis further demonstrated that these exosomes expressed special markers including CD63, TSG101 and CD81 (Figure 2C). Next, we labelled these exosomes with PKH26 to observe their interactions with lung cancer cells.

As shown in Figure S2B, exosomes derived from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic or miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor promoted the proliferation of lung cancer cells, compared to levels of proliferation observed in control lung cancer cells.

As shown in Figure 6A, five potential genes (BDNF, E2F3, FGFRL1, KCMF1 and NDUFA4) were screened. The results of qPCR analysis demonstrated that, among these genes, FGFRL1 was expressed at significantly decreased levels in lung cancer cells transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic (Figure 6B). The results of the dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay verified that FGFRL1 may be a target of miR\u2010210\u20103p (Figure 6C,D). In order to clarify the relationship between lung CSC\u2010derived exosomal miR\u2010210\u20103p and FGFRL1, we performed Western blot analysis to measure the expression level of FGFRL1 in lung cancer cells after co\u2010incubation with lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes. As shown in Figure 6E, FGFRL1 levels were both decreased in lung cancer cells incubated with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic or miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor\u2010transfected lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes, compared with control levels; the decreased levels were more apparent in lung cancer cells after incubation with exosomes from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic. When lung cancer cells in which FGFRL1 had been silenced with siRNA were compared with lung cancer cells, migratory and invasive potential were enhanced; expression levels of N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 increased; and E\u2010cadherin expression decreased (Figure 7A\u2010D).

As shown in Figure 1A, through limiting dilution analysis, we demonstrated that the SFE of tumour sphere\u2010derived cells was significantly increased, compared to that of parental A549 cells. Indeed, single cells derived from tumour spheres were able to form new spheres, whereas parental A549 cells had no such effect. Most A549 cells present in the non\u2010adhesive culture appeared to be dead (Figure 1B). When we evaluated tumorigenesis in vivo, we found that inoculation with 102, 103, 104 or 105 tumour spheres generated tumours in 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 and 3/3 of inoculations, respectively. Inoculation with 103, 104, 105 and 106 of parental A549 cells generated tumours in 0/3, 0/3, 0/3 and 2/3 of inoculations (Figure 1C). Stemness\u2010associated markers including ALDH1, Sox2, Nanog and CD133 were closely involved with maintenance of the stemness phenotype in lung CSCs. Through qPCR and Western blot analysis, we verified that the expression levels of these markers were significantly higher in tumour spheres than in parental A549 cells (Figure 1D\u2010E). Immunofluorescent staining analysis further revealed that the intensity of ALDH1 and CD133 fluorescence was higher in tumour spheres, compared to parental A549 cells (Figure 1F). CSCs acquire enhanced metastatic ability during the EMT. The results of the Transwell assays performed in this study showed that the number of migrated or invaded cells derived from tumour spheres was greatly increased, compared to the number of migrated or invaded cells derived from parental A549 cells (Figure 1G\u2010H). Western blot analysis of tumour spheres further showed that the expression of EMT\u2010associated proteins including N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 was up\u2010regulated, whereas E\u2010cadherin expression was down\u2010regulated (Figure 1I). These results suggest that tumour spheres derived from parental A549 cells expressed the stemness phenotype. These cells appeared to have dedifferentiated into lung CSCs.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Identification of stemness phenotype in tumour spheres derived from parental A549 cells.

As shown in Figure 2, the characteristics of exosomes were verified through TEM, NTA and Western blot analysis. TEM observation revealed that most vesicles had a typical cup\u2010shaped morphology (Figure 2A). NTA analysis showed that the average diameter of exosomes ranged from 30 to 150\u00a0nm (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis further demonstrated that these exosomes expressed special markers including CD63, TSG101 and CD81 (Figure 2C). Next, we labelled these exosomes with PKH26 to observe their interactions with lung cancer cells. As shown in Figure 2D, lung cancer cells internalized lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes, indicating that CSC\u2010derived exosomes may regulate lung cancer cells. Interestingly, the results of MTT analysis showed that when lung cancer cells were co\u2010incubated with lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes for more than 2\u00a0days, cell proliferation increased (Figure 2E).\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Characterization of exosomes purified from lung CSCs.

In contrast, the exosomes derived from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic enhanced the metastatic abilities of lung cancer cells (Figure 5A\u2010E). To confirm the direct transfer of miR\u2010210\u20103p from lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes to lung cancer cells, we transfected lung CSCs with FAM\u2010miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic and then labelled secreted exosomes containing FAM\u2010miR\u2010210\u20103p with Dil. Under fluorescence microscopy, red and green signals were detected in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells exposed to these Dil\u2010labelled exosomes (Figure S2A). This result was in accordance with our finding that miR\u2010210\u20103p expression was significantly increased in lung cancer cells treated with exosomes derived from miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic\u2010transfected lung CSCs, compared to lung cancer cells treated with exosomes derived from the untreated group (Figure 5B).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            Exosomal miR\u2010210\u20103p regulates the metastatic potential of lung cancer cells derived from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor.

As shown in Figure S2B, exosomes derived from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic or miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor promoted the proliferation of lung cancer cells, compared to levels of proliferation observed in control lung cancer cells. This pro\u2010proliferative effect was more readily apparent in the cells treated with exosomes from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic.\n3.5\n        FGFRL1 may be a target of miR\u2010210\u20103p in lung cancer cells\n        To further verify the molecular mechanism by which miR\u2010210\u20103p promotes a pro\u2010metastatic phenotype in lung cancer cells, three bioinformatics software programs (TargetScan, miRTarBase and miDB) were used to identify possible potential downstream targets of miR\u2010210\u20103p. As shown in Figure 6A, five potential genes (BDNF, E2F3, FGFRL1, KCMF1 and NDUFA4) were screened. The results of qPCR analysis demonstrated that, among these genes, FGFRL1 was expressed at significantly decreased levels in lung cancer cells transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic (Figure 6B). The results of the dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay verified that FGFRL1 may be a target of miR\u2010210\u20103p (Figure 6C,D). In order to clarify the relationship between lung CSC\u2010derived exosomal miR\u2010210\u20103p and FGFRL1, we performed Western blot analysis to measure the expression level of FGFRL1 in lung cancer cells after co\u2010incubation with lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes. As shown in Figure 6E, FGFRL1 levels were both decreased in lung cancer cells incubated with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic or miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor\u2010transfected lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes, compared with control levels; the decreased levels were more apparent in lung cancer cells after incubation with exosomes from lung CSCs transfected with miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic. When lung cancer cells in which FGFRL1 had been silenced with siRNA were compared with lung cancer cells, migratory and invasive potential were enhanced; expression levels of N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 increased; and E\u2010cadherin expression decreased (Figure 7A\u2010D). However, metastatic ability decreased in lung cancer cells overexpressing FGFRL1 (Figure S3A\u2010D).\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            miR\u2010210\u20103p promotes a pro\u2010metastatic phenotype by targeting FGFRL1.

Updated therapeutic strategies include the use of third\u2010generation EGFR/TKI or PD\u20101/PD\u2010L1 checkpoint inhibitors. However, the overall survival of patients with advanced lung cancer remains low, and the clinical prognosis is poor.\n22\n Metastasis is the most common cause of death in this patient population. The suppression of lung cancer metastasis may be a promising and feasible therapeutic strategy for improving survival among lung cancer patients.\n      Lung CSCs play an important role in tumour metastasis and recurrence. In this study, the tumour spheres derived from parental A549 cells overexpressed stemness\u2010associated markers including CD133, Nanog, Sox2 and ALDH1, which are associated with the lung CSC phenotype.\n23\n, \n24\n The gold standard for the differentiation of CSCs from parental cancer cells is the capacity for self\u2010renewal.\n25\n By analysing SFE in vitro, we verified that SFE was significantly increased in tumour spheres, compared to parental A549 cells. Another characteristic associated with the capacity for self\u2010renewal is the enhanced tumorigenesis of lung CSCs in vivo. One previous study of a mouse model indicated that inoculation with only 102 lung CSCs resulted in xenograft formation.\n26\n In this study, we demonstrated that inoculation with 102 tumour spheres generated xenografts, whereas there was no xenograft formation in mice inoculated subcutaneously with 105 parental A549 cells. These findings provide further support for the potent self\u2010renewal of tumour spheres. EMT has been confirmed to be an essential step for metastasis. E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin and vimentin have been identified as the main proteins associated with cell migration.\n27\n MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 are proteolytic enzymes that facilitate cell invasion by degrading extracellular matrix, which leads to metastasis.\n28\n Previous reports indicated that lung CSCs were endowed with EMT characteristics and increased risk for metastasis.\n29\n Indeed, in our study, we found that migratory and invasive abilities were increased in tumour spheres, compared to parental A549 cells; expression levels of N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 were also increased in tumour spheres, compared to parental A549 cells. Cumulatively, these results indicate that tumour spheres derived from parental A549 cells possess stemness phenotypic features and may be used as lung CSCs in subsequent experiments.\n      Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that contain bioactive microRNAs. Recent reports have suggested that exosomes derived from the tumour microenvironment may communicate with cancer cells in the vicinity by transferring special microRNAs to regulate the metastatic potential of recipient cells. For example, CAF\u2010derived exosomes were found to enhance the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells through the transfer of miR\u20101228\n12\n; MDSCs releasing exosomal miR\u2010126a were found to promote lung metastasis.\n13\n In addition, mast cells may transfer exosomal miR\u2010490 to hepatocellular cancer cells and thus accelerate metastasis.\n14\n Whether lung CSCs, as a necessary and important component of the tumour microenvironment, regulate lung cancer metastasis via the transfer of exosomal microRNAs remains to be clarified. We therefore purified lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes for the experiments in this study. As reported previously,\n30\n the diameter of exosomes purified from lung CSCs ranged from 30 to 150\u00a0nm. This exosome population expressed special markers such as CD63, TSG101 and CD81. We labelled exosomes with PKH26 and demonstrated that these fluorescent exosomes entered lung cancer cells. We also verified that lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities of lung cancer cells; increased N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101 expression; and decreased E\u2010cadherin expression. Along similar lines, Wang et al\n\n18\n reported that CSCs promoted EMT in renal cancer cells via the transfer of exosomes. \n      The functional roles of miR\u2010210 have been described previously. As one of the major hypoxic microRNAs, miR\u2010210 is up\u2010regulated in several types of cancer including renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, indicating that miR\u2010210 may act as an oncogenic microRNA.\n31\n The role of miR\u2010210 in lung cancer has also been reported. He et al\n\n32\n showed that miR\u2010210 expression was increased in cancerous tissue samples from patients with lung cancer and closely related to poor progression\u2010free survival in lung cancer patients. Xu et al\n\n33\n demonstrated that miR\u2010210 levels were up\u2010regulated in serum and tumour tissue from lung cancer patients and positively associated with lymph node metastasis. Indeed, some researchers have reported that miR\u2010210 promotes the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.\n34\n, \n35\n Notably, there are two versions of miR\u2010210: miR\u2010210\u20103p and miR\u2010210\u20105p. Previously, only the 3\u2019\u2010arm of precursor microRNA (designated as the guide strand) was thought to mature and become functional, whereas the complementary 5\u2019\u2010arm (referred to as the passenger strand) was considered to be destined for degradation.\n36\n For miR\u2010210, miR\u2010210\u20103p is the guide strand, which integrates into the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC), whereas miR\u2010210\u20105p is the passenger strand, which is inactivated by degradation. Recently, Ren et al\n\n19\n suggested that miR\u2010210\u20103p promoted prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis; Petrozza et al demonstrated that miR\u2010210\u20103p may be a biomarker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma metastasis.\n20\n More importantly, Xian et al showed that exosomes derived from hypoxic mesenchymal stem cells promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells via the transfer of miR\u2010210\u20103p.\n21\n We chose miR\u2010210\u20103p as our research target to clarify the possible involvement of miR\u2010210\u20103p in lung cancer cell metastasis via lung CSC\u2010derived exosome transfer. The results of the experiments performed showed that miR\u2010210\u20103p levels were higher in lung CSCs and in the exosomes derived therefrom, compared with control cells. Next, we transfected lung CSCs with miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibitor or miR\u2010210\u20103p mimic and purified exosomes derived from these exosomes to explore the functional role of exosomal miR\u2010210\u20103p in lung cancer metastasis. As expected, our results verified that exosomal miR\u2010210\u20103p derived from lung CSCs contributed to the pro\u2010metastatic phenotype of lung cancer cells, including enhanced migratory and invasive abilities as well as up\u2010regulated expression levels of N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101, with down\u2010regulated E\u2010cadherin expression.\n      Our investigation of the molecular mechanism by which lung CSC\u2010derived exosomal miR\u2010210\u20103p regulates lung cancer metastasis revealed that FGFRL1 may be the functional target of miR\u2010210\u20103p. Indeed, Liu et al\n\n37\n demonstrated that, in osteosarcoma cells, miR\u2010210 promoted cell migration and invasion by targeting FGFRL1. In a study of hepatocellular carcinoma, Yang et al\n\n38\n found that miR\u2010210 promoted cancer angiogenesis by targeting FGFRL1. Despite the tumour\u2010promoting roles of the miR\u2010210/FGFRL1 signalling axis mentioned above, some studies have yielded conflicting results. Tsuchiya et al\n\n39\n demonstrated that miR\u2010210 inhibited the proliferation of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells by targeting FGFRL1. Zou et al showed that miR\u2010210 inhibited the proliferation of laryngocarcinoma cells and induced apoptosis through effects on FGFRL1.\n40\n Recently, Yang et al\n\n41\n reported that miR\u2010210\u20103p inhibited bladder tumour growth and metastasis by targeting FGFRL1. In this study, we demonstrated that lung CSC\u2010derived exosomes regulated FGFRL1 expression in lung cancer cells via the transfer of miR\u2010210\u20103p. Furthermore, silencing FGFRL1 with siRNA promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells and up\u2010regulated expression levels of N\u2010cadherin, MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20101, whereas E\u2010cadherin expression was down\u2010regulated. However, in FGFRL1\u2010overexpressing lung cancer cells, metastatic potential decreased markedly. In combination, these results suggest that FGFRL1 acts in a tissue\u2010 and cell\u2010specific manner. In lung cancer, FGFRL1 may act as a tumour suppressor, but further investigation is needed.\n5\n      CONCLUSION\n      To sum up, our results preliminarily demonstrate that lung CSCs contribute to a pro\u2010metastatic phenotype in lung cancer cells by transferring exosomes carrying miR\u2010210\u20103p. FGFRL1 may be a target of miR\u2010210\u20103p in the regulation of lung cancer metastasis.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n      Feng Luo and Li Wang conceived the study and designed the project; Li Wang performed most experiments; Jun He, Yanyang Liu and Li Tu performed some in vitro experiments; Zhen Sun and Haoyue Hu performed some in vivo experiments; and Feng Luo and Li Wang wrote and revised the manuscript.
