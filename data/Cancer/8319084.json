    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the performance of early US after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant NAST in identifying excellent responders to NAST in TNBC patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to model the probability of pCR using the percentage of tumor volume reduction by ultrasound from baseline to after 2 cycles of AC. Positive predictive value (PPV) analysis identified a cutoff point of 80% TVR after 2 cycles; the pCR rate was 77% (17/22) in patients with TVR \u2265 80%, AUC was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.92, P < .0001).",

    "description": "Background:\n          Heterogeneity exists in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) response to standard anthracycline/taxane based neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) with 40\u201350% of patients having pathologic complete response to therapy (pCR). Early assessment of imaging response during NAST may identify a subset of TNBCs that are likely to have pCR upon completion of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the performance of early US after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant NAST in identifying excellent responders to NAST in TNBC patients.\nMaterials and Methods:\n          215 patients with TNBC enrolled in the ongoing ARTEMIS clinical trial. The patients were divided into a discovery cohort (n=107) and a validation cohort (n=108). Receiver operating characteristic analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to model the probability of pCR using the percentage of tumor volume reduction by ultrasound from baseline to after 2 cycles of AC.\nResults:\n          Overall, 39.3% (42/107) of patients achieved pCR. Positive predictive value (PPV) analysis identified a cutoff point of 80% TVR after 2 cycles; the pCR rate was 77% (17/22) in patients with TVR \u2265 80%, AUC was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.92, P < .0001). In the validation cohort, the pCR was 44%. The PPV for pCR with a TVR \u2265 80% after two cycles was 76% (95% CI: 55%\u221291%) and AUC was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.87, P<0.0001).\nConclusions:\n          Percentage TVR by US evaluation after 2 cycles of NAST may be a cost-effective early imaging biomarker for pCR to AC/taxane-based NAST.",
