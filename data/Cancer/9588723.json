    "description": "Background:\n          Compared to women of other races who have never smoked, Black women have a higher risk of lung cancer. Whether neighborhood disadvantage, which Black women experience at higher rates than other women, is linked to never-smoking lung cancer risk remains unclear. This study investigates the association of neighborhood disadvantage and lung cancer risk in Black never-smoking women.\nMethods and materials:\n          This research utilized data from the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, a prospective cohort of 59,000 Black women recruited from across the US in 1995 and followed by biennial questionnaires. Associations of lung cancer incidence with neighborhood-level factors (including two composite variables derived from Census Bureau data: neighborhood socioeconomic status and neighborhood concentrated disadvantage), secondhand smoke exposure, and PM2.5 were estimated using Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models.\nResults:\n          Among 37,650 never-smokers, 77 were diagnosed with lung cancer during follow-up from 1995 to 2018. The adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) of lung cancer incidence with ten unit increase in neighborhood concentrated disadvantage index was 1.30 (95 % CI: 1.04, 1.63, p = 0.023). Exposure to secondhand smoke at work was associated with increased risk (sHR = 1.93, 95 % CI: 1.21, 3.10, p = 0.006), but exposure to secondhand smoke at home and PM2.5 was not.\nConclusion:\n          Worse neighborhood concentrated disadvantage was associated with increased lung cancer risk in Black women who never smoked. These findings suggest that non-tobacco-related factors in disadvantaged neighborhoods may be linked to lung cancer risk in Black women and that these factors must be understood and targeted to achieve health equity.",
