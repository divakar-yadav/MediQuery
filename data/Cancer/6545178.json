    "description": "Literature search\n      We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed. Only English written literature was collected, and randomized trials or meta-analyses were included. Several reports that did not meet these criteria were adopted, but only when all committee members considered them as clinically important in terms of safety or efficacy. Committee members performed literature searches from Dec. 2004 to Jun. 2013 using the keywords \u201clung cancer and chemotherapy.\u201d After Jul. 2013, the Japan Medical Library Association kindly supported us and performed literature searches using a method devised by their own specialists. In their searches, papers published until Dec 31, 2017 were collected using text from clinical questions (CQs) as keywords. Several conference presentations were adopted regardless of their date when they were considered to provide huge influence on our daily practice.\nProcess of guideline development\n      Guideline committee (expert panel) consisted of medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients from patient advocacy group. Initially, guideline committee members developed clinical questions (CQs) and collected evidences as described above. Evidences were systematically reviewed for every CQ and committee members decided the strength of evidence (Table\u00a01). Considering this strength of evidence and other factors (i.e. risk\u2013benefit balance and social values), we determined the final recommendation. In this guideline, we have two levels of recommendations (1; strong or 2; weak) in two directions (to do or not to do) (Table\u00a02). Recommendation was accepted when at least 60% of expert panel members reached an agreement. Whole process of developing guideline was carried out in accordance with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/).\n      \nTable 1Strength of evidenceLevelStrengthExampleAHighSeveral high-quality studies with consistent resultsBModerateOne high-quality studyCLowStudies with severe limitationsDVery lowStudies with very severe limitations or expert opinion\n\n      \nTable 2Four types of recommendationsRecommendation levelDirection1 (strong)To do (=\u2009recommend to do)2 (weak)To do (=\u2009suggest to do)1 (strong)Not to do (=\u2009recommend not to do)2 (weak)Not to do (=\u2009suggest not to do)\nOutline\n      Cytotoxic chemotherapy has long been a mainstream component in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC. A meta-analysis showed that cytotoxic chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care (BSC) [1]. Cytotoxic chemotherapy accounted for 9% increase in 1-year survival (from 20 to 29%), or 1.5-month prolongation of OS. Another analysis, using third-generation cytotoxic chemotherapy, showed that monotherapy led to about 7% improvement in 1-year survival compared with BSC [2]. Regarding toxicity, another meta-analysis regarding NSCLC showed that treatment-related deaths with cytotoxic chemotherapy comprised 1.26%, and consisted of febrile neutropenia, cardiovascular events, and pulmonary toxicities [3]. Third-generation cytotoxic chemotherapy alone also showed better quality-of-life (QOL) scores than BSC [4]. Platinum agent plus third-generation cytotoxic chemotherapy showed similar QOL compared with third-generation cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, while progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were better in combination chemotherapy in a phase III trial [5].\n      Since the 2000s, novel agents such as molecular-targeted drugs and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been demonstrating better outcomes compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n      Most of the molecular-targeted drugs used in the treatment of NSCLC inhibit specific targets that induce cancer evolution [so-called \u201concogenic drivers (i.e., EGFR mutation, ALK translocation, ROS1 translocation, and BRAF mutation)\u201d]. Among those patients who harbor such oncogenic drivers and have good PS, these inhibitors demonstrated both ORR and PFS improvement. Phase III trials were conducted in EGFR- and ALK-altered patients, and kinase inhibitors have been shown to be more effective compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy [6\u201312]. For other types of genetic alterations, phase III trials have not been conducted, due to their rarity. Instead, similar efficacy results were observed in phase II trials or subset analyses of phase III trials. Molecular-targeted drugs usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy [13\u201316]. It is also important that they showed beneficial results in patients with poor PS in relatively small, but prospective studies [17, 18].\n      Since 2015, ICIs, which has a novel mode of action compared with other chemotherapeutic drugs, have been approved for administration in Japan. ICIs target immune-checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/L1, which are negative regulators in tumor immunity. A phase III trial, KEYNOTE-024, compared pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in EGFR/ALK-negative, advanced NSCLC patients with tumor positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% [19]. Pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated significant improvement of ORR, PFS, and OS, with tolerability. In addition to this, several phase III studies showed higher efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy plus ICI than platinum-based chemotherapy alone in advanced NSCLC [20\u201323].\n      In summary, chemotherapy (cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular-targeted drugs, and ICIs) demonstrated prolongation of OS and improvement of QOL compared with BSC among advanced NSCLC patients with good PS. To determine optimal treatment regimen, it is essential to check appropriate biomarkers such as driver oncogenes for molecular-targeted drugs and PD-L1 status for ICIs before their use. Therefore, while diagnosing advanced NSCLC patients, it is also important to categorize them into three entities: (1) driver oncogene-positive, (2) PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, and (3) others (Fig.\u00a01). Treatment strategy of each of these subgroups is described below (Fig.\u00a02).\n      \nFig. 1After diagnosis, patients will be categorized into three subgroups. EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor, ALK anaplastic lymphoma kinase, PD-L1 programed death-ligand 1\n\n      \nFig. 2Treatment strategy of each subgroups in NSCLC, stage IV. PD-1 programed cell death-1, PD-L1 programed death-ligand 1\n\n      \nDriver oncogene-positive [CQ 1\u201317]\n\n      As previously described, kinase inhibitors for their specific driver oncogenes demonstrated improvement of ORR and PFS. OS was not improved, because most of the patients in standard arm received kinase inhibitors after progression. A large observational study in EGFR-mutated patients demonstrated that PFS with erlotinib did not differ, regardless of treatment line [24]. A firm conclusion regarding the treatment sequence between kinase inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapy cannot be drawn. However, a prospective observational study in the U.S. analyzed 10 genes in 733 patients, and oncogenic drivers were detected among 466 patients (64%). The study also showed that the patients who had oncogenic drivers and received kinase inhibitors lived longer than those who had oncogenic drivers, but did not receive inhibitors (3.5\u00a0years versus 2.4\u00a0years, propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.90, p\u2009=\u20090.006) [25]. This evidence supports the notion that patients with driver oncogene should not lose the chance of receiving kinase inhibitors, and this guideline recommends that clinicians should administer kinase inhibitors prior to cytotoxic chemotherapy in this subgroup. In the second-line setting, cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended in accordance with the patient\u2019s general condition: CQ 20\u201323.\n      Regarding ICI for patients with oncogenic drivers, refer to CQ 5 and 6. Regarding squamous cell carcinoma with oncogenic drivers, refer to CQ 17.\n      \n2.PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% [CQ 18 and 19]\n\n      As data suggest that this subgroup can receive much benefit from ICI, pembrolizumab monotherapy is recommended. Similarly, platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/L1 inhibitor is recommended. In the second-line setting, cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended in accordance with the patient\u2019s general condition.\n      \n3.Others (driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1\u2009<\u200950%, or unknown) [CQ 20\u201331]\n\n      No molecular-targeted drugs or ICIs showed benefit compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Conventional chemotherapy is the standard of care in accordance with the patient\u2019s PS, age, and histology, while platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/L1 inhibitor is recommended when patients have good PS.\n      Note: Definition of the elderly.\n      In Japan, patients who are aged 70\u201375\u00a0years are considered as elderly. However, patients who are \u2265\u200975\u00a0years of age have historically been excluded from clinical trials in Japan. Recently, however, most participants of phase II and phase III trials in elderly patients have been \u2265\u200975\u00a0years of age. Based on these considerations, this guideline defines elderly patients as those who are \u2265\u200975\u00a0years of age.\n      \n        \n          \nSummary of clinical questions\n\n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Driver oncogene-positive\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \nTreatment of driver oncogene-positive patients (non-squamous cell lung cancer)\n\n            \n            \n              CQ 1.

Among those patients who harbor with such oncogenic drivers and have good PS, these inhibitors demonstrated both ORR and PFS improvement. Phase III trials were conducted in EGFR- and ALK-mutated patients, and kinase inhibitors have been shown to be more effective compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy [6\u201310, 12, 26]. For other types of genetic alterations, phase III trials have not been conducted due to their rarity [i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation (see CQ 10), ROS1 translocation (see CQ 15), and BRAF mutation (see CQ 16)]. Instead, similar efficacy results were observed in phase II trials or subset analyses of phase III trials (i.e., afatinib in EGFR uncommon mutation, crizotinib in ROS1 mutation) [13\u201316, 27]. A prospective observational study in the US analyzed 10 genes in 733 patients, and oncogenic drivers were detected among 466 patients (64%). The study also showed that the patients who had oncogenic drivers and received kinase inhibitors lived longer than those who had oncogenic drivers, but did not receive inhibitors (3.5\u00a0years versus 2.4\u00a0years, propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.90, p\u2009=\u20090.006) [25]. As there are limited data regarding ICIs in patients with oncogenic drivers, current data do not show superiority of ICIs to efficacy of TKIs (see CQ 7).\n            OS was not improved in phase III trials that compared TKIs with cytotoxic chemotherapy, because most of the patients in cytotoxic chemotherapy arm received kinase inhibitors after progression. A large observational study in EGFR-mutated patients demonstrated that PFS with erlotinib did not differ, regardless of treatment line [24]. A firm conclusion regarding the treatment sequence between EGFR-TKI and cytotoxic chemotherapy cannot be drawn.

Regarding gefitinib and alectinib, prospective trials were reported in EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged patients with poor PS [17, 18].Although data are limited in patients who have other types of driver oncogenes, based on the results of patients with EGFR or ALK alteration, we strongly recommend administration of kinase inhibitors in this population.

The number of patients with PS 3\u20134 was small (22 and 6, relatively), but there were no serious safety issues [17, 18]. In the gefitinib trial, ORR was 66%, and 79% of the patients experienced PS improvement. For other types of genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, and BRAF mutation), data of the patients with PS 3\u20134 are very limited, but efficacy may be expected in patients with PS 2.On the other hand, AE profiles and severity are divers among the drugs. Some of the agents require higher frequencies of drug discontinuation or decrease, even in patients with PS 0\u20131, and more caution should be paid in case of patients with PS 3\u20134.\n\n            We judged quality of evidence as C, and strength of recommendation as 2.

Erlotinib demonstrated similar efficacy regardless of age in a Japanese phase II trial [29].\n            No data are available regarding elderly (\u2265\u200975\u00a0years) patients with other genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, BRAF mutation), and kinase inhibitors usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, administration of kinase inhibitors in the elderly is relatively feasible. Based on the results of EGFR-TKIs in the elderly, we recommend the use of any kinase inhibitor for elderly patients who have driver oncogene. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1.

However, most of the patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy before or after kinase inhibitors in the phase III trials. Post hoc analyses represented that those patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy had better prognosis compared with those who did not in prospective trials [30, 31], and similar tendency was shown in a large-scale Japanese observational study [32]. Among EGFR-mutated patients, efficacy of chemotherapy may not be different from that in EGFR wild-type patients, although no prospective trial has been conducted. Thus, previous evidence, including mixed types of EGFR mutation, can apply to this CQ (also see CQ 5, 20, 21 and 23).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy even in patients who have driver oncogene during their lines of treatment.

However, this result should be interpreted with caution, because this was not a pre-planned analysis and mutation status was not defined as an allocation factor. Atezolizumab arm showed more AEs (\u2265\u2009grade 3) than control arm (58.5% vs. 50.0%), including immune-related AEs such as diarrhea (20.6% vs. 15.2%) and skin rash (13.3% vs. 5.1%).

In a single-center analysis, ORR of ICIs was only 3.8% in patients who were positive for EGFR or ALK [35].

In phase III trials comparing EGFR-TKI (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, types of EGFR mutation were limited to or consisted mostly of these two mutations [6\u201310, 26]. All trials demonstrated significant prolongation of PFS in EGFR-TKI arm, and several QOL items were improved [36].\n            \nFLAURA is a phase III trial comparing osimertinib with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) in stage IV NSCLC patients who have EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) and PS of 0\u20131. In this trial, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in osimertinib arm [18.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.37\u20130.57), p\u2009<\u20090.001] [37].

Of those, ORR with afatinib in a small subset of a trial was 71.1%, which showed relatively higher tendency than other EGFR-TKIs [16]. Although this result was obtained in a prospective manner, a firm conclusion as to recommend afatinib as better than other EGFR-TKIs cannot be drawn.\n            Based on this evidence, gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib is weakly recommended in patients who have EGFR mutation of exon18-21, except for exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, exon20 insertion, and T790M mutation, with PS of 0\u20131. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 2.

In the FLAURA study, only 5 of 556 patients had de novo T790M mutation. On the other hand, six of seven de novo T790M mutation patients experienced PR in the phase I trial of osimertinib [52]. In patients with EGFR T790M mutation after progression of EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib showed good efficacy results in the phase III trial. This indirectly suggests that similar efficacy may be expected in patients with de novo T790M mutation.Based on this evidence, osimertinib is weakly recommended in patients who have de novo EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation with PS of 0\u20131.

A phase III trial comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with osimertinib was conducted in those patients who had EGFR T790M mutation after progression of the first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) [53]. PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in osimertinib arm [10.1 months versus 4.4 months, HR 0.30 (95%CI: 0.23-0.41), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. There were fewer adverse events greater than grade 3 in osimertinib arm (6% versus 34%).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of osimertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutation after progression of EGFR-TKIs.

Regarding crizotinib and ceritinib, these were compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in phase III trials. Crizotinib showed significant prolongation of PFS [10.9 months versus 7.0 months, HR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.35\u20130.60), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] and improvement in ORR (74% versus 45%) [54]. Ceritinib showed significant prolongation of PFS [16.6 months versus 8.1 months, HR 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.73), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] and improvement in ORR (72.5% versus 26.7%) [55].\n            Alectinib was compared with crizotinib in phase III trials and showed significant prolongation of PFS [25.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.38 (95% CI: 0.26\u20130.55), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] in a Japanese trial. Similar results were also replicated in a US trial [HR 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34\u20130.65), p\u2009<\u20090.001], although 600\u00a0mg of alectinib was administered [56\u201358]. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 52% of patients in crizotinib arm, while 26% in alectinib arm [56].\n            Based on the current data, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 0\u20131. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. On the other hand, OS data in these trials were immature. The superiority of alectinib in terms of OS is unknown.\n            In a phase I/II trial and phase II trials, crizotinib followed by alectinib showed relatively good efficacy (ORR of 48\u201350% and median PFS of 8.1\u20138.9 months) [59\u201361]. Thus, crizotinib can be an alternative first-line treatment. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2.\n            Similarly, ceritinib can be considered as an alternative, but no comparative study with other ALK-TKI has been conducted. Treatment-related adverse events were seen in 65% of the patients, and liver dysfunction was the main event [55]. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2.\n            Regarding elderly patients, 16% of the participants were \u2265\u200965\u00a0years old in the phase III trial comparing crizotinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and efficacy was similar between elderly and younger patients [54]. In addition, 11% of the participants were \u2265\u200975\u00a0years old in the phase III trial comparing alectinib with crizotinib, and advantage of alectinib over crizotinib was similar among the elderly.\n            The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            (a)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            (b)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation096%(26/27)004%(1/27)\n\n            (c)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation096%(26/27)004%(1/27)\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 13\n            What is the recommended first-line treatment in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 2\u20134?\n            Recommendation:\n            Alectinib is strongly recommended.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: C\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            Comments:\n            One study reported the efficacy of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with poor PS [18]. Although the number of patients was relatively small (PS 2: 12 patients, PS 3: 5 patients, and PS 4: 1 patient), there was no severe adverse event. In this trial, ORR was 72%. In the phase III trial comparing alectinib with crizotinib, there were fewer adverse events in the alectinib arm, although only 2% of the patients had PS of 2 [56].\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 2\u20134.

In Japan, 23 patients who had progressed with crizotinib were treated with alectinib [62]. In this trial, ORR was 65% and mPFS was 12.9 months. Although there are no comparable data of alectinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, these results from single-arm trials can be considered to be at least equivalent.Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in crizotinib-refractory, ALK-rearranged patients.

In a single-arm phase II trial in ALK-rearranged patients who progressed with crizotinib and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, ORR was 38.6% and mPFS was 5.7 months. In a phase III study (ASCEND-5) comparing ceritinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy (PEM or DTX), PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in ceritinib arm [5.4 months versus 1.6 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.36\u20130.67), p\u2009<\u20090.001] [65]. In a Japanese phase I trial, 5 of 9 patients who had treatment history with crizotinib had PR with higher GI toxicities [66]. Although there are no comparable data of ceritinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, these efficacy results can be considered equivalent, and toxicity may be higher than with alectinib. In addition, the ASCEND-5 study set cytotoxic chemotherapy monotherapy as a control, which makes the results difficult to interpret.\n\n            Based on this evidence, we weakly recommend the administration of ceritinib in crizotinib-refractory, ALK-rearranged patients.

Although this suggests limited efficacy of EGFR-TKI in this population, caution is advised, because at least three patients had uncommon EGFR mutation in this report [69\u201371]. Several retrospective analyses with small sample size showed ORR of 25\u201332% and mPFS of 1.4\u20133.9 months [69, 72, 73].

In addition, ORR was significantly improved (44.8% versus 27.8%). Main adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and pyrexia in the pembrolizumab arm, while anemia, nausea, and fatigue were common in the platinum-doublet chemotherapy arm. There were fewer adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 in pembrolizumab arm (26.6% versus 53.3%). On the other hand, immune-related adverse events such as thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, skin rash, and colitis were reported (9.7% were \u2265\u2009grade 3). Careful management should be applied.Regarding the elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, no subgroup analysis from this trial or any prospective data has been reported.Based on this evidence, pembrolizumab monotherapy is strongly recommended in patients whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% and does not have EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.

In this trial, 616 patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio and 67 (32.5%) were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy after progression of platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a crossover treatment. In an interim analysis, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [8.8 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.52 (95%CI: 0.43\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (secondary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [median not reached versus 11.3 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 9.4 months versus 4.7 months, HR 0.36 (95%CI: 0.25\u20130.52), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: median not reached versus 10.0 months, HR 0.42 (95%CI: 0.26\u20130.68), p\u2009=\u20090.0001]. Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bvacizumab (arm C) were reported [21]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [8.3 months versus 6.8 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.74), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS (another co-primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [19.2 months versus 14.7 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64-96), p\u2009=\u20090.02]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC3 or IC3, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 12.6 months versus 6.8 months, HR 0.39 (95%CI: 0.25\u20130.60), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: 25.2 months versus 15.0 months, HR 0.70 (95%CI: 0.43\u20131.13)]. Main adverse events were appetite loss, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were slightly higher (58.5% versus 50.0%). In chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, immune-related adverse events such as skin rash, liver dysfunction, thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, and colitis were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            \n(b-2)Squamous cell lung cancer.\n\n            A phase III trial comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (KEYNOTE-407 study) [22]. In this trial, 559 patients were randomized. In an interim analysis, PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [6.4 months versus 4.8 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.70), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (another primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [15.9 months versus 11.3 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.49\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.0008]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, both PFS and OS tended to be prolonged [PFS: 8.0 months versus 4.2 months, HR 0.37 (95%CI: 0.24\u20130.58); and OS: median not reached in either arm, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.37\u20131.10)]. Main adverse events were anemia, appetite loss, neutropenia, and nausea in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (69.8% versus 68.2%). On the other hand, treatment-related deaths were higher in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm (3.6% versus 2.1%).\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER131 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX (arm C) were reported [23]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [6.3 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. However, improvement of OS (another co-primary endpoint) was not shown at the time of this interim analysis [14.0 months versus 13.9 months, HR 0.96 (95%CI: 0.78\u20131.18), p\u2009=\u20090.6931]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC3 or IC3, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 10.1 months versus 5.5 months, HR 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27\u20130.71); and OS: 23.6 months versus 14.1 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.32\u20130.99)]. Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding the elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [20\u201323] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [21, 23]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131, whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, and who do not have EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement. On the other hand, as there has been no direct comparison between chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and pembrolizumab alone, the superiority has not been clarified. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation69%(18/26)31%(8/26)000\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 19\n            What is the recommended first-line treatment in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%?\n            Recommendation:\n            \nCytotoxic chemotherapy is strongly recommended.\n\n            Monotherapy;\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate xx%\n            CBDCA\u2014doublet therapy;\n            Recommendation: 2\n            Evidence level: B\n            Agreement rate xx%\n            \n(b)Pembrolizumab monotherapy is weakly recommended.\n\n            Recommendation: 2\n            Evidence level: D\n            Agreement rate 85%\n            \n(c)There is no clear evidence to recommend the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.\n\n            Unable to determine recommendation.\n            Comments:\n            \nRefer to CQ 22.As the KEYNOTE-024 study allowed enrollment of patients with PS 0\u20131 [74], there have been no efficacy or safety data of pembrolizumab monotherapy in stage IV NSCLC patients with PS 2. On the other hand, there is limited evidence regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this area. The efficacy was modest, while these patients often suffered from adverse events. Regarding the lesser toxicity of pembrolizumab, many guideline committee members supported pembrolizumab as an option for this population.Based on this evidence, after careful consideration, the guideline committee weakly recommends the administration of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% as an expert opinion. We judged quality of evidence as D and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation085%(22/26)15%(4/26)00\n\n            \n(c)As four phase III trials comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor with platinum-based chemotherapy allowed enrollment of patients with PS 0\u20131, there are no efficacy or safety data of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in stage IV NSCLC patients with PS 2. Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%.

In another meta-analysis, comparing second-generation agent with third-generation agent as a part of a platinum-based regimen, the latter was found to be superior, with ORR of 12% and 1-year survival rate of 6% [2]. In a Japanese phase III trial (FACS study), four regimens of platinum agents plus third-generation agents were compared, and their efficacies were similar [75].\n            Newer agents demonstrated the efficacy in several phase III studies, but some showed their efficacy on specific histology types. PEM is one typical example and is approved for non-squamous cell lung cancer. In study JMDB, comparing cisplatin (CDDP)\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009gemcitabine (GEM), efficacy results were similar in overall population. However, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM showed better OS in non-squamous cell lung cancer [11.8 versus 10.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.70\u20130.94), p\u2009=\u20090.005], while inferior OS was shown in squamous cell lung cancer [9.4 months versus 10.8 months, HR 1.23 (95%CI: 1.00\u20131.51), p\u2009=\u20090.05] [76]. Even though this was a subset analysis, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM are considered one of the preferred regimens for non-squamous cell lung cancer in terms of efficacy and safety. Regarding CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM, although there has been no phase III trial to investigate its OS benefit, it is commonly used due to its milder non-hematologic toxicity than CDDP. In randomized studies comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009DTX, or CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab, superiority in OS or safety was not demonstrated [77\u201379]. On the other hand, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of OS seemed to be similar between CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [79], and PFS of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab tended to be better than CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [80]. Based on these results, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM can be considered as a first-line treatment regimen.\n            For squamous cell lung cancer, a Japanese phase III trial comparing CDGP\u2009+\u2009DTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX was conducted [81]. OS was significantly prolonged in CDGP arm [13.6 months versus 11.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.02), p\u2009=\u20090.037]. Regarding toxicity, leukopenia, neutropenia, and platelet count decrease were common in CDGP arm, while nausea, fatigue, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were common in CDDP arm. This was the only regimen to show OS superiority in Japan.\n            In other phase III trials of S-1, non-superiority was demonstrated comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX against CDDP\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX [82, 83]. In a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX, significant ORR improvement was demonstrated [33.0% versus 25.0 months, response rate ratio 1.31 (95%CI: 1.08\u20131.59), p\u2009=\u20090.005] [84]. These regimens can be used regardless of histology.\n            Based on this evidence, combination of platinum agent and third- or later-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and younger than 75\u00a0years old.

They also reported that instrumental ADL, not chronological age, was associated with better prognosis. Another report mentioned that octogenarian patients did not show worse OS than younger patients (7\u00a0months versus 11 months, p\u2009=\u20090.20) and they also had similar safety result, even when they had PS of 0\u20131 [86]. These reports suggest that elderly patients should not be excluded from anti-cancer treatment due to their chronological age.\n            \nPhase III trials demonstrated that vinorelbine (VNR) prolonged OS compared with BSC, and also showed that GEM had similar efficacy to VNR [87, 88]. In a Japanese phase III trial (WJTOG9904 study) comparing DTX with VNR, PFS was significantly prolonged in DTX arm [5.5 months versus 3.1 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.82), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS was favorable in DTX arm, but without statistical significance [14.3 months versus 9.9 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.56\u20131.09), p\u2009=\u20090.138] [89].\n\n            Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old.

Of those, the Japanese study (JCOG-0803/WJOG-4307L) compared weekly CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX with DTX [90]. Interim analysis showed that combination treatment was not superior to monotherapy in OS [13.3\u00a0months versus 14.8 months, HR 1.18 (95% CI: 0.83\u20131.69)], which resulted in early termination. Study IFCT0501 compared CBDCA\u2009+\u2009weekly PTX with GEM or VNR [91]. PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in combination arm [PFS: 6.0\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.62), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 10.3\u00a0months versus 6.2 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.78), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. However, these results were not more satisfactory than DTX monotherapy in a Japanese trial, and treatment-related deaths were relatively high in combination arm (4.4%). In addition, dosing of combination arm was unfamiliar in Japanese clinical practice. These results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.\n\n            Based on this evidence, CBDCA doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old.

In this study, about 30% of patients had PS 2. From the three trials that were included in this meta-analysis, subset analyses of patients with PS 2 were reported, and each of the OS results tended to be prolonged [92].Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)A phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with PTX (CALGB9730 study), subset analysis of PS 2 showed that 1-year survival rate was improved in the combination arm [18% versus 10%, HR 0.60 (95%CI: 0.40\u20130.91), p\u2009=\u20090.016] [93]. In ECOG1599 study comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM in patients with PS 2, OS was 6.2\u00a0months and 6.9 months, respectively, and these regimens were considered as feasible [94]. In a randomized phase II trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM with GEM, OS and PFS tended to be longer [OS: 6.7\u00a0months versus 4.8\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.49), PFS: 4.1\u00a0months versus 3.0\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.36)] [95]. Recently, a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with PEM was conducted [96]. This study had some limitations: only 205 patients were enrolled, which was relatively small as a phase III trial, and the inclusion of squamous cell lung cancer was allowed. However, OS was significantly improved in the combination arm [9.3\u00a0months versus 5.3 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.46\u20130.83), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. PFS was also improved [5.8\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.35\u20130.63), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Regarding toxicity, anemia and neutropenia were common in the combination arm and treatment-related death was observed in 3.9% of the patients.Based on this evidence, platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2. The guideline committee calls attention to the clinicians that this evidence is limited, and most regimens in these trials were CBDCA-based or reduced-dosed. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation0100%(27/27)000\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 23\n            Is addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy recommended in patients with PS 0\u20132, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown?\n            Recommendation:\n            \nAddition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131.\n\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: B\n            Agreement rate 78%\n            \n(b)There is no clear evidence to recommend the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum- containing chemotherapy in patients with PS 2.\n\n            Unable to determine recommendation.\n            Comments:\n            \nNon-squamous cell lung cancer.\n\n            A phase III trial comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 and who did not have EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (KEYNOTE-189 study) [20]. 616 patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio and 67 (32.5%) were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy after progression of platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a crossover treatment. In an interim analysis, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [8.8 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.52 (95%CI: 0.43\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (secondary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [median not reached versus 11.3 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 1\u201349%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 9.0 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.55 (95%CI: 0.37\u20130.81); and OS: median not reached versus 12.9 months, HR 0.55 (95%CI: 0.34\u20130.90)]. In patients with PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 6.1 months versus 5.1 months, HR 0.75 (95%CI: 0.53\u20131.05); and OS: 15.2 months versus 12.0 months, HR 0.59 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.92)]. Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (arm C) were reported [21] PFS (one of co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [8.3 months versus 6.8 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.74), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS (another co-primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [19.2 months versus 14.7 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64-96), p\u2009=\u20090.02]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC1/2 or IC1/2, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 8.3 months versus 6.6 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.41\u20130.77); and OS: 20.3 months versus 16.4 months, HR 0.80 (95%CI: 0.55\u20131.15)]. In patients with PD-L1 with TC0 and IC0, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 7.1 months versus 6.9 months, HR 0.77 (95%CI: 0.61\u20130.99); and OS: 17.1 months versus 14.1 months, HR 0.82 (95%CI: 0.62\u20131.08)]. Main adverse events were appetite loss, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were slightly higher (58.5% versus 50.0%). In chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, immune-related adverse events such as skin rash, liver dysfunction, thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, and colitis were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            \n(a-2)Squamous cell lung cancer.\n\n            A phase III trial comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (KEYNOTE-407 study) [22]. In this trial, 559 patients were randomized. In an interim analysis, PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [6.4 months versus 4.8 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.70), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (another primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [15.9 months versus 11.3 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.49\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.0008]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 1\u201349%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 7.2 months versus 5.2 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.39\u20130.80); and OS: 14.0 months versus 11.6 months, HR 0.57 (95%CI: 0.57\u20130.90)]. In patients with PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 6.3 months versus 5.3 months, HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.47\u20130.98); and OS: 15.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.98)]. Main adverse events were anemia, appetite loss, neutropenia, and nausea in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (69.8% versus 68.2%). On the other hand, treatment-related deaths were higher in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm (3.6% versus 2.1%).\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER131 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX (arm C) were reported [23]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [6.3 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. However, improvement of OS (another co-primary endpoint) was not shown at the time of this interim analysis [14.0 months versus 13.9 months, HR 0.96 (95%CI: 0.78\u20131.18), p\u2009=\u20090.6931]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC1/2 or IC1/2, PFS tended to be longer, but OS was not prolonged [PFS: 6.0 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.70(95%CI: 0.53\u20130.92); and OS: 12.4 months versus 16.6 months, HR 1.34 (95%CI: 0.95\u20131.90)]. In patients with PD-L1 with TC0 and IC0, results were similar in PFS and OS [PFS: 5.7 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.64\u20131.03); and OS: 13.8 months versus 12.5 months, HR 0.86 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.15)]. Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [2, 75\u201377] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study; and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [75, 77]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum- containing chemotherapy is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation78%(21/27)22%(6/27)000\n\n            \n(b)As four phase III trials comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor with platinum-based chemotherapy allowed enrollment of patients with PS 0\u20131 [20\u201323], there has been no efficacy or safety data of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in stage IV NSCLC patients with PS 2. Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PS 2, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown. The guideline committee finally determined that there is insufficient evidence to draw a firm conclusion on this CQ. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation0074%(20/27)22%(6/27)4%(1/27)\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 24\n            What is the recommended number of courses of platinum-based chemotherapy?\n            Recommendation:\n            Six or fewer courses of platinum-based chemotherapy are strongly recommended.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: C\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            Comments:\n            Two phase III trials comparing three or four courses of combination chemotherapy consisting of platinum and third-generation agent with six courses of the same regimen both showed that 1-year survival and OS were similar, while toxicity was milder with the former [97, 98]. An individual-patient data meta-analysis that containing these two studies compared six courses with five or fewer courses demonstrated that PFS was significantly prolonged by six courses of treatment, but OS was similar [99].\n            Recent phase III trials mostly defined the maximum number of courses of platinum-based chemotherapy as four to six. In a phase III trial comparing CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (JMDB study), the median number of courses of CDDP treatment was five in both arms [76].\n            Based on this evidence, six or fewer courses of platinum-based chemotherapy are strongly recommended.

In addition, one of the analyses reported prolongation of OS [100, 101]. On the other hand, toxicity\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3, such as proteinuria, hypertension, hemorrhagic events, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and treatment-related death, were significantly increased by adding bevacizumab [100\u2013102].In a phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX (ECOG4599 study), prolongation of OS and PFS was demonstrated [PFS: 6.2 months versus 4.5 months, HR 0.66 (95%CI: 0.57\u20130.77), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 12.3 months versus 10.3 months, HR 0.79 (95%CI: 0.67\u20130.92), p\u2009=\u20090.003] [103]. ORR was also improved. On the other hand, in another phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (AVAiL study), PFS was prolonged, but OS was similar [104]. In a Japanese phase II trial (JO19907 study) using the same regimen as in ECOG4599, ORR and PFS were better [ORR: 60.7% versus 31.0%, PFS: 6.9 months versus 5.9 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI 0.42\u20130.89), p\u2009=\u20090.009], but OS was not prolonged [22.8 months versus 23.4 months, HR 0.99 (0.65\u20131.50)] [105]. In China, a phase III trial (BEYOND study) also using the same regimen as in ECOG4599 was conducted [106]. That trial demonstrated prolongation of both PFS and OS [PFS: 9.2 months versus 6.5 months, HR 0.40 (95%CI: 0.29\u20130.54), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 24.3 months versus 17.7 months, HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.93), p\u2009=\u20090.0154].Based on this evidence, addition of bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and <\u200975\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2.

In another combined analysis, of ECOG4599 and the PointBreak study, benefits of OS and PFS were less, especially in patients who were >\u200975\u00a0years old [108]. In a retrospective study conducted in the US (ARIES study), efficacy was similar between patients age below 65, between 65 and 75, and those above 75 years, but arterial thrombosis\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 tended to be increased in the elderly subset (1.5% <\u200965 years, 2.9% \u2265\u200965 years, and 3.5% \u2265\u200975\u00a0years) [109]. In a cohort study conducted in Europe (SAiL study), efficacy was similar between patients aged below and above 70 years, but hemorrhagic events tended to be increased in the elderly subset (3.5% <\u200970 years, 5.3% \u2265\u200970\u00a0years). In Japan, there are no sufficient data of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in the elderly.Based on this evidence, not to add bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 2.

Continuation maintenance involves the continuation of an agent other than a platinum agent.\n            Comments:\n            \nIn a phase III trial of continuation maintenance with PEM after CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM (PARAMOUNT study), PFS and OS were significantly prolonged [PFS: 4.1 months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.73), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64\u20130.96), p\u2009=\u20090.0195] [112]. In the maintenance arm, QOL was not deteriorated. Toxicity was higher, but manageable. Another phase III trial compared maintenance PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab with bevacizumab after CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (AVAPERL study) [113]. In that trial, PFS was significantly prolonged [7.4 months versus 3.7 months, HR 0.48 (95%CI: 0.44\u20130.75), p\u2009<\u20090.0001], but OS was not significant.Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, continuation maintenance with pemetrexed is strongly recommended.We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.

However, there was a limitation that crossover rate to PEM in the placebo arm was low (18%).Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of platinum-based chemotherapy without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, switch maintenance with pemetrexed is weakly recommended.

Studies with nivolumab or atezolizumab were conducted regardless of PD-L1 expression (CheckMate-017 study, CheckMate-057 study, OAK study [118\u2013120]), while a study of pembrolizumab was conducted only in patients whose tumor expressed PD-L1\u2009>\u20091% (KEYNOTE-010 study [121]).These trials enrolled patients with PS 0\u20131; thus, efficacy and safety data of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with PS 2 in the second-line setting were unclear. However, considering milder toxicity of these agents compared with cytotoxic drugs, many guideline committee members supported PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as an option for this population. On the other hand, ORR of these drugs was 10\u201320% in the previous reports. Once they are not effective, the guideline committee also recommends a prompt change to cytotoxic chemotherapy.Based on this evidence, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is strongly recommended in patients who progressed with the first-line treatment.

This may suggest that some patients benefited from DTX. In addition, DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM significantly prolonged OS compared to DTX alone, but this combination has not been compared with any PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.Based on this evidence, cytotoxic chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients who progressed with first-line treatment.

In TAX-320 study, DTX 75\u00a0mg/m2 showed improvement in ORR, PFS rate at 26 weeks, and OS rate at 1\u00a0year compared with VNR or IFM, although they were not statistically significant [123]. In another study, comparing DTX 75\u00a0mg/m2 with BSC, MST and OS rate at 1\u00a0year were superior in DTX arm (7.5\u00a0months versus 4.6 months, 37% versus 19%, respectively), and QOL was also improved [124]. In a Japanese phase II trial, 60\u00a0mg/m2 of DTX showed relatively similar efficacy (ORR 18.2% and OS 7.8\u00a0months) [125]. Regarding evidence of DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM, refer to CQ 30.\n            In a phase III trial comparing PEM with DTX, non-inferiority of OS was not demonstrated [8.3 months versus 7.9 months, HR 0.99 (95%CI: 0.80\u20131.20)], but seemed similar. Regarding toxicity, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (grade 3\u20134) and alopecia (any grade) were increased in DTX arm. In non-squamous cell lung cancer subset, OS was longer in PEM arm [9.3 months versus 8.0 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI 0.61-1.00), p\u2009=\u20090.076] [126, 127].\n            An East Asian phase III trial comparing S-1 with DTX in patients with PS 0\u20132 as their second- or third-line treatment was conducted [128]. Non-inferiority of OS was demonstrated [12.8 months versus 12.5 months, HR 0.95 (95%CI 0.83\u20131.07), p\u2009=\u20090.38]. ORR and PFS were similar (ORR: 8.3% versus 9.9%, mPFS: 2.9 months in both arms).

Hypertension\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 was 6% and most hemorrhagic events were grade 1\u20132.In a Japanese randomized phase II trial (JVCG study), PFS tended to be longer [5.2 months versus 4.2 months, HR 0.83 (95%CI 0.59\u20131.16)] [130]. Tendency in ORR and OS were similar (ORR: 28.9% versus 18.5%, OS 15.2 months versus 13.9 months). Febrile neutropenia was commonly observed in DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM arm (34% versus 19%).Based on this evidence, addition of RAM to DTX is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131.

This study included both EGFR-mutated and wild-type patients.\n            On the contrary, in another phase III trial, which compared erlotinib with DTX in patients who were EGFR wild-type (TAILOR study), OS was significantly prolonged in DTX arm [8.2 months versus 5.4 months, HR 0.73 (95%CI 0.53-1.00), p\u2009=\u20090.05] [132]. In Japan, erlotinib was compared with DTX in a phase III trial [133]. In a subset of EGFR wild-type patients, PFS was superior in DTX arm [2.9 months versus 1.3 months, HR 1.57 (95%CI 1.18\u20132.11), p\u2009<\u20090.01].\n            Recently, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM demonstrated superiority to DTX, and S-1 demonstrated non-inferiority to DTX. Considering this situation, efficacy of erlotinib is relatively low. In addition, those patients who were EGFR wild-type had some clinical risk factors of interstitial lung disease with EGFR-TKI.\n            Based on this evidence, not to administer erlotinib is weakly recommended in patients who are EGFR wild-type or unknown.

Among those patients who harbor with such oncogenic drivers and have good PS, these inhibitors demonstrated both ORR and PFS improvement. Phase III trials were conducted in EGFR- and ALK-mutated patients, and kinase inhibitors have been shown to be more effective compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy [6\u201310, 12, 26]. For other types of genetic alterations, phase III trials have not been conducted due to their rarity [i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation (see CQ 10), ROS1 translocation (see CQ 15), and BRAF mutation (see CQ 16)]. Instead, similar efficacy results were observed in phase II trials or subset analyses of phase III trials (i.e., afatinib in EGFR uncommon mutation, crizotinib in ROS1 mutation) [13\u201316, 27]. A prospective observational study in the US analyzed 10 genes in 733 patients, and oncogenic drivers were detected among 466 patients (64%). The study also showed that the patients who had oncogenic drivers and received kinase inhibitors lived longer than those who had oncogenic drivers, but did not receive inhibitors (3.5\u00a0years versus 2.4\u00a0years, propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.90, p\u2009=\u20090.006) [25]. As there are limited data regarding ICIs in patients with oncogenic drivers, current data do not show superiority of ICIs to efficacy of TKIs (see CQ 7).\n            OS was not improved in phase III trials that compared TKIs with cytotoxic chemotherapy, because most of the patients in cytotoxic chemotherapy arm received kinase inhibitors after progression. A large observational study in EGFR-mutated patients demonstrated that PFS with erlotinib did not differ, regardless of treatment line [24]. A firm conclusion regarding the treatment sequence between EGFR-TKI and cytotoxic chemotherapy cannot be drawn. Molecular-targeted drugs usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy, but AE profiles and severity are divers.\n            Based on this evidence, kinase inhibitors targeting each oncogene are recommended treatment for patients who have driver oncogene with good PS (0\u20131).

Their efficacy was relatively similar to those with PS of 0\u20131 [8, 9, 12]. Regarding gefitinib and alectinib, prospective trials were reported in EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged patients with poor PS [17, 18].Although data are limited in patients who have other types of driver oncogenes, based on the results of patients with EGFR or ALK alteration, we strongly recommend administration of kinase inhibitors in this population. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1.

In the gefitinib trial, ORR was 66%, and 79% of the patients experienced PS improvement. For other types of genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, and BRAF mutation), data of the patients with PS 3\u20134 are very limited, but efficacy may be expected in patients with PS 2.On the other hand, AE profiles and severity are divers among the drugs. Some of the agents require higher frequencies of drug discontinuation or decrease, even in patients with PS 0\u20131, and more caution should be paid in case of patients with PS 3\u20134.\n\n            We judged quality of evidence as C, and strength of recommendation as 2.

Erlotinib demonstrated similar efficacy regardless of age in a Japanese phase II trial [29].\n            No data are available regarding elderly (\u2265\u200975\u00a0years) patients with other genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, BRAF mutation), and kinase inhibitors usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, administration of kinase inhibitors in the elderly is relatively feasible. Based on the results of EGFR-TKIs in the elderly, we recommend the use of any kinase inhibitor for elderly patients who have driver oncogene. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1. Note that more attention to adverse events should be paid in this population than in younger patients.\n            The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation96%(27/28)4%(1/28)000\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 4\n            Is cytotoxic chemotherapy recommended for patients who have driver oncogene?\n            Recommendation:\n            Cytotoxic chemotherapy is strongly recommended even in patients who have driver oncogene.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate 100%.\n            Comments:\n            Kinase inhibitors are the key drugs in patients with driver oncogenes. However, most of the patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy before or after kinase inhibitors in the phase III trials. Post hoc analyses represented that those patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy had better prognosis compared with those who did not in prospective trials [30, 31], and similar tendency was shown in a large-scale Japanese observational study [32]. Among EGFR-mutated patients, efficacy of chemotherapy may not be different from that in EGFR wild-type patients, although no prospective trial has been conducted. Thus, previous evidence, including mixed types of EGFR mutation, can apply to this CQ (also see CQ 5, 20, 21 and 23).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy even in patients who have driver oncogene during their lines of treatment.

However, this result should be interpreted with caution, because this was not a pre-planned analysis and mutation status was not defined as an allocation factor. Atezolizumab arm showed more AEs (\u2265\u2009grade 3) than control arm (58.5% vs. 50.0%), including immune-related AEs such as diarrhea (20.6% vs. 15.2%) and skin rash (13.3% vs. 5.1%).

In phase III trials comparing EGFR-TKI (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, types of EGFR mutation were limited to or consisted mostly of these two mutations [6\u201310, 26]. All trials demonstrated significant prolongation of PFS in EGFR-TKI arm, and several QOL items were improved [36].\n            \nFLAURA is a phase III trial comparing osimertinib with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) in stage IV NSCLC patients who have EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) and PS of 0\u20131. In this trial, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in osimertinib arm [18.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.37\u20130.57), p\u2009<\u20090.001] [37]. Regarding toxicity, first-generation EGFR-TKIs showed diarrhea in 57%, skin rash in 48%, AST elevation in 25%, and interstitial lung disease in 2% of patients, while osimertinib showed milder toxicities (diarrhea 58%, skin rash 25%, AST elevation 9%, and interstitial lung disease 4%).Based on these balances between efficacy and toxicity, we strongly recommend osimertinib in patients who have EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) with PS of 0\u20131.

The efficacy in those patients was relatively similar to that in those with PS of 0\u20131. Gefitinib showed efficacy in prospective trials in patients with poor PS [28, 46]. Data are insufficient regarding efficacy and safety of afatinib and dacomitinib in this population [10, 26, 38].

On the other hand, administration should be considered carefully, because poor PS is a well-known risk factor of interstitial lung disease, as are male, smoking history, pre-existing interstitial lung disease, patients who have limited normal lung region, and those with heart disease [40, 41]. The guideline committee had thorough discussion regarding patients with PS of 4. For such patients, physicians must consider whether EGFR-TKI would improve PS, or symptoms that are more meaningful outcomes than good PS.\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of gefitinib in patients who have EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) with PS of 3\u20134.

They are usually sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, but ORR was slightly lower than that observed in common mutation [50]. Most of the phase III trials completely excluded these mutations [6, 8, 9], or the mutations existed in only 10% of the entire population [7, 10, 26].\n            Among patients with uncommon mutation other than exon20 insertion and T790M mutation, ORR was reported as 48\u201371% [16, 50]. Of those, ORR with afatinib in a small subset of a trial was 71.1%, which showed relatively higher tendency than other EGFR-TKIs [16]. Although this result was obtained in a prospective manner, a firm conclusion as to recommend afatinib as better than other EGFR-TKIs cannot be drawn.\n            Based on this evidence, gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib is weakly recommended in patients who have EGFR mutation of exon18-21, except for exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, exon20 insertion, and T790M mutation, with PS of 0\u20131.

In patients with EGFR T790M mutation after progression of EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib showed good efficacy results in the phase III trial. This indirectly suggests that similar efficacy may be expected in patients with de novo T790M mutation.Based on this evidence, osimertinib is weakly recommended in patients who have de novo EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation with PS of 0\u20131.

A phase III trial comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with osimertinib was conducted in those patients who had EGFR T790M mutation after progression of the first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) [53]. PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in osimertinib arm [10.1 months versus 4.4 months, HR 0.30 (95%CI: 0.23-0.41), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. There were fewer adverse events greater than grade 3 in osimertinib arm (6% versus 34%).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of osimertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutation after progression of EGFR-TKIs.

Regarding crizotinib and ceritinib, these were compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in phase III trials. Crizotinib showed significant prolongation of PFS [10.9 months versus 7.0 months, HR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.35\u20130.60), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] and improvement in ORR (74% versus 45%) [54]. Ceritinib showed significant prolongation of PFS [16.6 months versus 8.1 months, HR 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.73), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] and improvement in ORR (72.5% versus 26.7%) [55].\n            Alectinib was compared with crizotinib in phase III trials and showed significant prolongation of PFS [25.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.38 (95% CI: 0.26\u20130.55), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] in a Japanese trial. Similar results were also replicated in a US trial [HR 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34\u20130.65), p\u2009<\u20090.001], although 600\u00a0mg of alectinib was administered [56\u201358]. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 52% of patients in crizotinib arm, while 26% in alectinib arm [56].\n            Based on the current data, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 0\u20131. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. On the other hand, OS data in these trials were immature. The superiority of alectinib in terms of OS is unknown.\n            In a phase I/II trial and phase II trials, crizotinib followed by alectinib showed relatively good efficacy (ORR of 48\u201350% and median PFS of 8.1\u20138.9 months) [59\u201361]. Thus, crizotinib can be an alternative first-line treatment. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2.\n            Similarly, ceritinib can be considered as an alternative, but no comparative study with other ALK-TKI has been conducted. Treatment-related adverse events were seen in 65% of the patients, and liver dysfunction was the main event [55]. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2.\n            Regarding elderly patients, 16% of the participants were \u2265\u200965\u00a0years old in the phase III trial comparing crizotinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and efficacy was similar between elderly and younger patients [54]. In addition, 11% of the participants were \u2265\u200975\u00a0years old in the phase III trial comparing alectinib with crizotinib, and advantage of alectinib over crizotinib was similar among the elderly.\n            The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            (a)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            (b)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation096%(26/27)004%(1/27)\n\n            (c)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation096%(26/27)004%(1/27)\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 13\n            What is the recommended first-line treatment in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 2\u20134?\n            Recommendation:\n            Alectinib is strongly recommended.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: C\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            Comments:\n            One study reported the efficacy of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with poor PS [18]. Although the number of patients was relatively small (PS 2: 12 patients, PS 3: 5 patients, and PS 4: 1 patient), there was no severe adverse event. In this trial, ORR was 72%. In the phase III trial comparing alectinib with crizotinib, there were fewer adverse events in the alectinib arm, although only 2% of the patients had PS of 2 [56].\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 2\u20134.

In Japan, 23 patients who had progressed with crizotinib were treated with alectinib [62]. In this trial, ORR was 65% and mPFS was 12.9 months. Although there are no comparable data of alectinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, these results from single-arm trials can be considered to be at least equivalent.Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in crizotinib-refractory, ALK-rearranged patients. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1.

In a single-arm phase II trial in ALK-rearranged patients who progressed with crizotinib and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, ORR was 38.6% and mPFS was 5.7 months. In a phase III study (ASCEND-5) comparing ceritinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy (PEM or DTX), PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in ceritinib arm [5.4 months versus 1.6 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.36\u20130.67), p\u2009<\u20090.001] [65]. In a Japanese phase I trial, 5 of 9 patients who had treatment history with crizotinib had PR with higher GI toxicities [66]. Although there are no comparable data of ceritinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, these efficacy results can be considered equivalent, and toxicity may be higher than with alectinib. In addition, the ASCEND-5 study set cytotoxic chemotherapy monotherapy as a control, which makes the results difficult to interpret.\n\n            Based on this evidence, we weakly recommend the administration of ceritinib in crizotinib-refractory, ALK-rearranged patients.

However, subgroup data from prospective trials and their pooled analysis were reported. In a prospective trial, 11 patients for whom data were available demonstrated ORR of 9.1%. Although this suggests limited efficacy of EGFR-TKI in this population, caution is advised, because at least three patients had uncommon EGFR mutation in this report [69\u201371]. Several retrospective analyses with small sample size showed ORR of 25\u201332% and mPFS of 1.4\u20133.9 months [69, 72, 73].

In a subset analysis of PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 9.4 months versus 4.7 months, HR 0.36 (95%CI: 0.25\u20130.52), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: median not reached versus 10.0 months, HR 0.42 (95%CI: 0.26\u20130.68), p\u2009=\u20090.0001]. Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study).

OS (another co-primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [19.2 months versus 14.7 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64-96), p\u2009=\u20090.02]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC3 or IC3, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 12.6 months versus 6.8 months, HR 0.39 (95%CI: 0.25\u20130.60), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: 25.2 months versus 15.0 months, HR 0.70 (95%CI: 0.43\u20131.13)]. Main adverse events were appetite loss, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were slightly higher (58.5% versus 50.0%). In chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, immune-related adverse events such as skin rash, liver dysfunction, thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, and colitis were reported.

In this trial, 559 patients were randomized. In an interim analysis, PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [6.4 months versus 4.8 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.70), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (another primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [15.9 months versus 11.3 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.49\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.0008]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, both PFS and OS tended to be prolonged [PFS: 8.0 months versus 4.2 months, HR 0.37 (95%CI: 0.24\u20130.58); and OS: median not reached in either arm, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.37\u20131.10)]. Main adverse events were anemia, appetite loss, neutropenia, and nausea in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (69.8% versus 68.2%). On the other hand, treatment-related deaths were higher in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm (3.6% versus 2.1%).\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER131 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX (arm C) were reported [23]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [6.3 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. However, improvement of OS (another co-primary endpoint) was not shown at the time of this interim analysis [14.0 months versus 13.9 months, HR 0.96 (95%CI: 0.78\u20131.18), p\u2009=\u20090.6931]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC3 or IC3, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 10.1 months versus 5.5 months, HR 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27\u20130.71); and OS: 23.6 months versus 14.1 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.32\u20130.99)]. Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding the elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [20\u201323] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [21, 23]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131, whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, and who do not have EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement. On the other hand, as there has been no direct comparison between chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and pembrolizumab alone, the superiority has not been clarified. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.

On the other hand, there is limited evidence regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this area. The efficacy was modest, while these patients often suffered from adverse events. Regarding the lesser toxicity of pembrolizumab, many guideline committee members supported pembrolizumab as an option for this population.Based on this evidence, after careful consideration, the guideline committee weakly recommends the administration of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% as an expert opinion. We judged quality of evidence as D and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation085%(22/26)15%(4/26)00\n\n            \n(c)As four phase III trials comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor with platinum-based chemotherapy allowed enrollment of patients with PS 0\u20131, there are no efficacy or safety data of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in stage IV NSCLC patients with PS 2. Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%. The guideline committee finally determined that there is insufficient evidence to draw a firm conclusion on this CQ.

Among those patients who harbor with such oncogenic drivers and have good PS, these inhibitors demonstrated both ORR and PFS improvement. Phase III trials were conducted in EGFR- and ALK-mutated patients, and kinase inhibitors have been shown to be more effective compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy [6\u201310, 12, 26]. For other types of genetic alterations, phase III trials have not been conducted due to their rarity [i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation (see CQ 10), ROS1 translocation (see CQ 15), and BRAF mutation (see CQ 16)]. Instead, similar efficacy results were observed in phase II trials or subset analyses of phase III trials (i.e., afatinib in EGFR uncommon mutation, crizotinib in ROS1 mutation) [13\u201316, 27]. A prospective observational study in the US analyzed 10 genes in 733 patients, and oncogenic drivers were detected among 466 patients (64%). The study also showed that the patients who had oncogenic drivers and received kinase inhibitors lived longer than those who had oncogenic drivers, but did not receive inhibitors (3.5\u00a0years versus 2.4\u00a0years, propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.90, p\u2009=\u20090.006) [25]. As there are limited data regarding ICIs in patients with oncogenic drivers, current data do not show superiority of ICIs to efficacy of TKIs (see CQ 7).\n            OS was not improved in phase III trials that compared TKIs with cytotoxic chemotherapy, because most of the patients in cytotoxic chemotherapy arm received kinase inhibitors after progression. A large observational study in EGFR-mutated patients demonstrated that PFS with erlotinib did not differ, regardless of treatment line [24]. A firm conclusion regarding the treatment sequence between EGFR-TKI and cytotoxic chemotherapy cannot be drawn. Molecular-targeted drugs usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy, but AE profiles and severity are divers.\n            Based on this evidence, kinase inhibitors targeting each oncogene are recommended treatment for patients who have driver oncogene with good PS (0\u20131).

Their efficacy was relatively similar to those with PS of 0\u20131 [8, 9, 12]. Regarding gefitinib and alectinib, prospective trials were reported in EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged patients with poor PS [17, 18].Although data are limited in patients who have other types of driver oncogenes, based on the results of patients with EGFR or ALK alteration, we strongly recommend administration of kinase inhibitors in this population. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation96%(27/28)4%(1/28)000\n\n            \n(b)Gefitinib or alectinib showed beneficial results in the two prospective trials of EGFR- or ALK-altered patients with poor PS.

In the gefitinib trial, ORR was 66%, and 79% of the patients experienced PS improvement. For other types of genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, and BRAF mutation), data of the patients with PS 3\u20134 are very limited, but efficacy may be expected in patients with PS 2.On the other hand, AE profiles and severity are divers among the drugs. Some of the agents require higher frequencies of drug discontinuation or decrease, even in patients with PS 0\u20131, and more caution should be paid in case of patients with PS 3\u20134.\n\n            We judged quality of evidence as C, and strength of recommendation as 2.

Erlotinib demonstrated similar efficacy regardless of age in a Japanese phase II trial [29].\n            No data are available regarding elderly (\u2265\u200975\u00a0years) patients with other genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, BRAF mutation), and kinase inhibitors usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, administration of kinase inhibitors in the elderly is relatively feasible. Based on the results of EGFR-TKIs in the elderly, we recommend the use of any kinase inhibitor for elderly patients who have driver oncogene. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1. Note that more attention to adverse events should be paid in this population than in younger patients.\n            The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation96%(27/28)4%(1/28)000\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 4\n            Is cytotoxic chemotherapy recommended for patients who have driver oncogene?\n            Recommendation:\n            Cytotoxic chemotherapy is strongly recommended even in patients who have driver oncogene.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate 100%.\n            Comments:\n            Kinase inhibitors are the key drugs in patients with driver oncogenes. However, most of the patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy before or after kinase inhibitors in the phase III trials. Post hoc analyses represented that those patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy had better prognosis compared with those who did not in prospective trials [30, 31], and similar tendency was shown in a large-scale Japanese observational study [32]. Among EGFR-mutated patients, efficacy of chemotherapy may not be different from that in EGFR wild-type patients, although no prospective trial has been conducted. Thus, previous evidence, including mixed types of EGFR mutation, can apply to this CQ (also see CQ 5, 20, 21 and 23).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy even in patients who have driver oncogene during their lines of treatment.

However, this result should be interpreted with caution, because this was not a pre-planned analysis and mutation status was not defined as an allocation factor. Atezolizumab arm showed more AEs (\u2265\u2009grade 3) than control arm (58.5% vs. 50.0%), including immune-related AEs such as diarrhea (20.6% vs. 15.2%) and skin rash (13.3% vs. 5.1%).

The study also showed that the patients who had oncogenic drivers and received kinase inhibitors lived longer than those who had oncogenic drivers, but did not receive inhibitors (3.5\u00a0years versus 2.4\u00a0years, propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.90, p\u2009=\u20090.006) [25]. As there are limited data regarding ICIs in patients with oncogenic drivers, current data do not show superiority of ICIs to efficacy of TKIs (see CQ 7).\n            OS was not improved in phase III trials that compared TKIs with cytotoxic chemotherapy, because most of the patients in cytotoxic chemotherapy arm received kinase inhibitors after progression. A large observational study in EGFR-mutated patients demonstrated that PFS with erlotinib did not differ, regardless of treatment line [24]. A firm conclusion regarding the treatment sequence between EGFR-TKI and cytotoxic chemotherapy cannot be drawn. Molecular-targeted drugs usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy, but AE profiles and severity are divers.\n            Based on this evidence, kinase inhibitors targeting each oncogene are recommended treatment for patients who have driver oncogene with good PS (0\u20131).

Their efficacy was relatively similar to those with PS of 0\u20131 [8, 9, 12]. Regarding gefitinib and alectinib, prospective trials were reported in EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged patients with poor PS [17, 18].Although data are limited in patients who have other types of driver oncogenes, based on the results of patients with EGFR or ALK alteration, we strongly recommend administration of kinase inhibitors in this population.

The number of patients with PS 3\u20134 was small (22 and 6, relatively), but there were no serious safety issues [17, 18]. In the gefitinib trial, ORR was 66%, and 79% of the patients experienced PS improvement. For other types of genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, and BRAF mutation), data of the patients with PS 3\u20134 are very limited, but efficacy may be expected in patients with PS 2.On the other hand, AE profiles and severity are divers among the drugs. Some of the agents require higher frequencies of drug discontinuation or decrease, even in patients with PS 0\u20131, and more caution should be paid in case of patients with PS 3\u20134.\n\n            We judged quality of evidence as C, and strength of recommendation as 2.

Erlotinib demonstrated similar efficacy regardless of age in a Japanese phase II trial [29].\n            No data are available regarding elderly (\u2265\u200975\u00a0years) patients with other genetic alterations (i.e., EGFR uncommon mutation, ROS1 translocation, BRAF mutation), and kinase inhibitors usually showed milder toxicity than cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, administration of kinase inhibitors in the elderly is relatively feasible. Based on the results of EGFR-TKIs in the elderly, we recommend the use of any kinase inhibitor for elderly patients who have driver oncogene. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1. Note that more attention to adverse events should be paid in this population than in younger patients.\n            The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation96%(27/28)4%(1/28)000\nCQ 4\n            Is cytotoxic chemotherapy recommended for patients who have driver oncogene?\n            Recommendation:\n            Cytotoxic chemotherapy is strongly recommended even in patients who have driver oncogene.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate 100%.\n            Comments:\n            Kinase inhibitors are the key drugs in patients with driver oncogenes. However, most of the patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy before or after kinase inhibitors in the phase III trials. Post hoc analyses represented that those patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy had better prognosis compared with those who did not in prospective trials [30, 31], and similar tendency was shown in a large-scale Japanese observational study [32]. Among EGFR-mutated patients, efficacy of chemotherapy may not be different from that in EGFR wild-type patients, although no prospective trial has been conducted. Thus, previous evidence, including mixed types of EGFR mutation, can apply to this CQ (also see CQ 5, 20, 21 and 23).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy even in patients who have driver oncogene during their lines of treatment.

However, this result should be interpreted with caution, because this was not a pre-planned analysis and mutation status was not defined as an allocation factor. Atezolizumab arm showed more AEs (\u2265\u2009grade 3) than control arm (58.5% vs. 50.0%), including immune-related AEs such as diarrhea (20.6% vs. 15.2%) and skin rash (13.3% vs. 5.1%).

In a single-center analysis, ORR of ICIs was only 3.8% in patients who were positive for EGFR or ALK [35].

In phase III trials comparing EGFR-TKI (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, types of EGFR mutation were limited to or consisted mostly of these two mutations [6\u201310, 26]. All trials demonstrated significant prolongation of PFS in EGFR-TKI arm, and several QOL items were improved [36].\n            \nFLAURA is a phase III trial comparing osimertinib with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) in stage IV NSCLC patients who have EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) and PS of 0\u20131. In this trial, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in osimertinib arm [18.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.37\u20130.57), p\u2009<\u20090.001] [37]. Regarding toxicity, first-generation EGFR-TKIs showed diarrhea in 57%, skin rash in 48%, AST elevation in 25%, and interstitial lung disease in 2% of patients, while osimertinib showed milder toxicities (diarrhea 58%, skin rash 25%, AST elevation 9%, and interstitial lung disease 4%).Based on these balances between efficacy and toxicity, we strongly recommend osimertinib in patients who have EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) with PS of 0\u20131.

They are usually sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, but ORR was slightly lower than that observed in common mutation [50]. Most of the phase III trials completely excluded these mutations [6, 8, 9], or the mutations existed in only 10% of the entire population [7, 10, 26].\n            Among patients with uncommon mutation other than exon20 insertion and T790M mutation, ORR was reported as 48\u201371% [16, 50]. Of those, ORR with afatinib in a small subset of a trial was 71.1%, which showed relatively higher tendency than other EGFR-TKIs [16]. Although this result was obtained in a prospective manner, a firm conclusion as to recommend afatinib as better than other EGFR-TKIs cannot be drawn.\n            Based on this evidence, gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib is weakly recommended in patients who have EGFR mutation of exon18-21, except for exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, exon20 insertion, and T790M mutation, with PS of 0\u20131. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation13%(3/24)87%(21/24)000\n\n            \n(b)There are few data regarding EGFR exon 20 insertion, and ORR in these reports was around 10% [16, 51]. Thus, EGFR-TKI was not considered as a first-line treatment option.\n\n            Based on this evidence, EGFR-TKI is not strongly recommended in patients who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation with PS of 0\u20131.

In the FLAURA study, only 5 of 556 patients had de novo T790M mutation. On the other hand, six of seven de novo T790M mutation patients experienced PR in the phase I trial of osimertinib [52]. In patients with EGFR T790M mutation after progression of EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib showed good efficacy results in the phase III trial. This indirectly suggests that similar efficacy may be expected in patients with de novo T790M mutation.Based on this evidence, osimertinib is weakly recommended in patients who have de novo EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation with PS of 0\u20131.

A phase III trial comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with osimertinib was conducted in those patients who had EGFR T790M mutation after progression of the first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) [53]. PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in osimertinib arm [10.1 months versus 4.4 months, HR 0.30 (95%CI: 0.23-0.41), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. There were fewer adverse events greater than grade 3 in osimertinib arm (6% versus 34%).\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of osimertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutation after progression of EGFR-TKIs.

Regarding crizotinib and ceritinib, these were compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in phase III trials. Crizotinib showed significant prolongation of PFS [10.9 months versus 7.0 months, HR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.35\u20130.60), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] and improvement in ORR (74% versus 45%) [54]. Ceritinib showed significant prolongation of PFS [16.6 months versus 8.1 months, HR 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.73), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] and improvement in ORR (72.5% versus 26.7%) [55].\n            Alectinib was compared with crizotinib in phase III trials and showed significant prolongation of PFS [25.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.38 (95% CI: 0.26\u20130.55), p\u2009<\u20090.0001] in a Japanese trial. Similar results were also replicated in a US trial [HR 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34\u20130.65), p\u2009<\u20090.001], although 600\u00a0mg of alectinib was administered [56\u201358]. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 52% of patients in crizotinib arm, while 26% in alectinib arm [56].\n            Based on the current data, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 0\u20131. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. On the other hand, OS data in these trials were immature. The superiority of alectinib in terms of OS is unknown.\n            In a phase I/II trial and phase II trials, crizotinib followed by alectinib showed relatively good efficacy (ORR of 48\u201350% and median PFS of 8.1\u20138.9 months) [59\u201361]. Thus, crizotinib can be an alternative first-line treatment. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2.\n            Similarly, ceritinib can be considered as an alternative, but no comparative study with other ALK-TKI has been conducted. Treatment-related adverse events were seen in 65% of the patients, and liver dysfunction was the main event [55]. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2.\n            Regarding elderly patients, 16% of the participants were \u2265\u200965\u00a0years old in the phase III trial comparing crizotinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and efficacy was similar between elderly and younger patients [54]. In addition, 11% of the participants were \u2265\u200975\u00a0years old in the phase III trial comparing alectinib with crizotinib, and advantage of alectinib over crizotinib was similar among the elderly.\n            The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            (a)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            (b)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation096%(26/27)004%(1/27)\n\n            (c)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation096%(26/27)004%(1/27)\nCQ 13\n            What is the recommended first-line treatment in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 2\u20134?\n            Recommendation:\n            Alectinib is strongly recommended.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: C\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            Comments:\n            One study reported the efficacy of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with poor PS [18]. Although the number of patients was relatively small (PS 2: 12 patients, PS 3: 5 patients, and PS 4: 1 patient), there was no severe adverse event. In this trial, ORR was 72%. In the phase III trial comparing alectinib with crizotinib, there were fewer adverse events in the alectinib arm, although only 2% of the patients had PS of 2 [56].\n            Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in patients who have ALK rearrangement with PS of 2\u20134.

In Japan, 23 patients who had progressed with crizotinib were treated with alectinib [62]. In this trial, ORR was 65% and mPFS was 12.9 months. Although there are no comparable data of alectinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, these results from single-arm trials can be considered to be at least equivalent.Based on this evidence, we strongly recommend the administration of alectinib in crizotinib-refractory, ALK-rearranged patients. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 1.

In a single-arm phase II trial in ALK-rearranged patients who progressed with crizotinib and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, ORR was 38.6% and mPFS was 5.7 months. In a phase III study (ASCEND-5) comparing ceritinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy (PEM or DTX), PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in ceritinib arm [5.4 months versus 1.6 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.36\u20130.67), p\u2009<\u20090.001] [65]. In a Japanese phase I trial, 5 of 9 patients who had treatment history with crizotinib had PR with higher GI toxicities [66]. Although there are no comparable data of ceritinib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, these efficacy results can be considered equivalent, and toxicity may be higher than with alectinib. In addition, the ASCEND-5 study set cytotoxic chemotherapy monotherapy as a control, which makes the results difficult to interpret.\n\n            Based on this evidence, we weakly recommend the administration of ceritinib in crizotinib-refractory, ALK-rearranged patients.

On the other hand, immune-related adverse events such as thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, skin rash, and colitis were reported (9.7% were \u2265\u2009grade 3). Careful management should be applied.Regarding the elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, no subgroup analysis from this trial or any prospective data has been reported.Based on this evidence, pembrolizumab monotherapy is strongly recommended in patients whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% and does not have EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement.

In this trial, 616 patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio and 67 (32.5%) were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy after progression of platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a crossover treatment. In an interim analysis, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [8.8 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.52 (95%CI: 0.43\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001].

In a subset analysis of PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 9.4 months versus 4.7 months, HR 0.36 (95%CI: 0.25\u20130.52), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: median not reached versus 10.0 months, HR 0.42 (95%CI: 0.26\u20130.68), p\u2009=\u20090.0001]. Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study).

In this trial, 559 patients were randomized. In an interim analysis, PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [6.4 months versus 4.8 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.70), p\u2009<\u20090.0001].

In a subset analysis of PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, both PFS and OS tended to be prolonged [PFS: 8.0 months versus 4.2 months, HR 0.37 (95%CI: 0.24\u20130.58); and OS: median not reached in either arm, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.37\u20131.10)]. Main adverse events were anemia, appetite loss, neutropenia, and nausea in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (69.8% versus 68.2%). On the other hand, treatment-related deaths were higher in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm (3.6% versus 2.1%).\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER131 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX (arm C) were reported [23]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [6.3 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. However, improvement of OS (another co-primary endpoint) was not shown at the time of this interim analysis [14.0 months versus 13.9 months, HR 0.96 (95%CI: 0.78\u20131.18), p\u2009=\u20090.6931]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC3 or IC3, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 10.1 months versus 5.5 months, HR 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27\u20130.71); and OS: 23.6 months versus 14.1 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.32\u20130.99)]. Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding the elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [20\u201323] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [21, 23]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131, whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%, and who do not have EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement. On the other hand, as there has been no direct comparison between chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and pembrolizumab alone, the superiority has not been clarified.

On the other hand, there is limited evidence regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this area. The efficacy was modest, while these patients often suffered from adverse events. Regarding the lesser toxicity of pembrolizumab, many guideline committee members supported pembrolizumab as an option for this population.Based on this evidence, after careful consideration, the guideline committee weakly recommends the administration of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% as an expert opinion.

Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%.

Regarding the lesser toxicity of pembrolizumab, many guideline committee members supported pembrolizumab as an option for this population.Based on this evidence, after careful consideration, the guideline committee weakly recommends the administration of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% as an expert opinion. We judged quality of evidence as D and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation085%(22/26)15%(4/26)00\n\n            \n(c)As four phase III trials comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor with platinum-based chemotherapy allowed enrollment of patients with PS 0\u20131, there are no efficacy or safety data of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in stage IV NSCLC patients with PS 2. Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with PS 2 and whose tumor is positive for PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%. The guideline committee finally determined that there is insufficient evidence to draw a firm conclusion on this CQ.

In another meta-analysis, comparing second-generation agent with third-generation agent as a part of a platinum-based regimen, the latter was found to be superior, with ORR of 12% and 1-year survival rate of 6% [2]. In a Japanese phase III trial (FACS study), four regimens of platinum agents plus third-generation agents were compared, and their efficacies were similar [75].\n            Newer agents demonstrated the efficacy in several phase III studies, but some showed their efficacy on specific histology types. PEM is one typical example and is approved for non-squamous cell lung cancer. In study JMDB, comparing cisplatin (CDDP)\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009gemcitabine (GEM), efficacy results were similar in overall population. However, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM showed better OS in non-squamous cell lung cancer [11.8 versus 10.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.70\u20130.94), p\u2009=\u20090.005], while inferior OS was shown in squamous cell lung cancer [9.4 months versus 10.8 months, HR 1.23 (95%CI: 1.00\u20131.51), p\u2009=\u20090.05] [76]. Even though this was a subset analysis, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM are considered one of the preferred regimens for non-squamous cell lung cancer in terms of efficacy and safety. Regarding CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM, although there has been no phase III trial to investigate its OS benefit, it is commonly used due to its milder non-hematologic toxicity than CDDP. In randomized studies comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009DTX, or CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab, superiority in OS or safety was not demonstrated [77\u201379]. On the other hand, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of OS seemed to be similar between CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [79], and PFS of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab tended to be better than CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [80]. Based on these results, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM can be considered as a first-line treatment regimen.\n            For squamous cell lung cancer, a Japanese phase III trial comparing CDGP\u2009+\u2009DTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX was conducted [81]. OS was significantly prolonged in CDGP arm [13.6 months versus 11.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.02), p\u2009=\u20090.037]. Regarding toxicity, leukopenia, neutropenia, and platelet count decrease were common in CDGP arm, while nausea, fatigue, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were common in CDDP arm. This was the only regimen to show OS superiority in Japan.\n            In other phase III trials of S-1, non-superiority was demonstrated comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX against CDDP\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX [82, 83]. In a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX, significant ORR improvement was demonstrated [33.0% versus 25.0 months, response rate ratio 1.31 (95%CI: 1.08\u20131.59), p\u2009=\u20090.005] [84]. These regimens can be used regardless of histology.\n            Based on this evidence, combination of platinum agent and third- or later-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and younger than 75\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation93%(25/27)7%(2/27)000\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 21\n            Is cytotoxic chemotherapy recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown?\n            Recommendation:\n            \nMonotherapy using third-generation drug is strongly recommended.\n\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            \n(b)CBDCA doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended.\n\n            Recommendation: 2\n            Evidence level: B\n            Agreement rate 74%\n            Comments:\n            In a post hoc analysis of a phase III trial of first-line treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy, efficacy was similar between those who were younger than 65\u00a0years and who were 65\u00a0years of age or older [85]. They also reported that instrumental ADL, not chronological age, was associated with better prognosis. Another report mentioned that octogenarian patients did not show worse OS than younger patients (7\u00a0months versus 11 months, p\u2009=\u20090.20) and they also had similar safety result, even when they had PS of 0\u20131 [86]. These reports suggest that elderly patients should not be excluded from anti-cancer treatment due to their chronological age.\n            \nPhase III trials demonstrated that vinorelbine (VNR) prolonged OS compared with BSC, and also showed that GEM had similar efficacy to VNR [87, 88]. In a Japanese phase III trial (WJTOG9904 study) comparing DTX with VNR, PFS was significantly prolonged in DTX arm [5.5 months versus 3.1 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.82), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS was favorable in DTX arm, but without statistical significance [14.3 months versus 9.9 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.56\u20131.09), p\u2009=\u20090.138] [89].\n\n            Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)For elderly NSCLC patients, two phase III trials comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy with third-generation drug monotherapy were reported, and most of the participants were \u2265\u200975\u00a0years old. Of those, the Japanese study (JCOG-0803/WJOG-4307L) compared weekly CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX with DTX [90]. Interim analysis showed that combination treatment was not superior to monotherapy in OS [13.3\u00a0months versus 14.8 months, HR 1.18 (95% CI: 0.83\u20131.69)], which resulted in early termination. Study IFCT0501 compared CBDCA\u2009+\u2009weekly PTX with GEM or VNR [91]. PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in combination arm [PFS: 6.0\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.62), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 10.3\u00a0months versus 6.2 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.78), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. However, these results were not more satisfactory than DTX monotherapy in a Japanese trial, and treatment-related deaths were relatively high in combination arm (4.4%). In addition, dosing of combination arm was unfamiliar in Japanese clinical practice. These results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.\n\n            Based on this evidence, CBDCA doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1.

In a subset of a meta-analysis comparing chemotherapy with BSC, OS was prolonged by chemotherapy regardless of PS [6% improvement in 1-year OS rate in patients with PS\u2009\u2265\u20092 (14% versus 8%)] [1].\n            \nA meta-analysis comparing the third-generation drugs (DTX, PTX, VNR, or GEM) with BSC demonstrated 7% of improvement in 1-year OS rate [2]. In this study, about 30% of patients had PS 2. From the three trials that were included in this meta-analysis, subset analyses of patients with PS 2 were reported, and each of the OS results tended to be prolonged [92].Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)A phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with PTX (CALGB9730 study), subset analysis of PS 2 showed that 1-year survival rate was improved in the combination arm [18% versus 10%, HR 0.60 (95%CI: 0.40\u20130.91), p\u2009=\u20090.016] [93]. In ECOG1599 study comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM in patients with PS 2, OS was 6.2\u00a0months and 6.9 months, respectively, and these regimens were considered as feasible [94]. In a randomized phase II trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM with GEM, OS and PFS tended to be longer [OS: 6.7\u00a0months versus 4.8\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.49), PFS: 4.1\u00a0months versus 3.0\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.36)] [95]. Recently, a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with PEM was conducted [96]. This study had some limitations: only 205 patients were enrolled, which was relatively small as a phase III trial, and the inclusion of squamous cell lung cancer was allowed. However, OS was significantly improved in the combination arm [9.3\u00a0months versus 5.3 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.46\u20130.83), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. PFS was also improved [5.8\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.35\u20130.63), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Regarding toxicity, anemia and neutropenia were common in the combination arm and treatment-related death was observed in 3.9% of the patients.Based on this evidence, platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2. The guideline committee calls attention to the clinicians that this evidence is limited, and most regimens in these trials were CBDCA-based or reduced-dosed.

In an interim analysis, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [8.8 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.52 (95%CI: 0.43\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (secondary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [median not reached versus 11.3 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001].

Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study).

On the other hand, treatment-related deaths were higher in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm (3.6% versus 2.1%).\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER131 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX (arm C) were reported [23]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [6.3 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. However, improvement of OS (another co-primary endpoint) was not shown at the time of this interim analysis [14.0 months versus 13.9 months, HR 0.96 (95%CI: 0.78\u20131.18), p\u2009=\u20090.6931]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC1/2 or IC1/2, PFS tended to be longer, but OS was not prolonged [PFS: 6.0 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.70(95%CI: 0.53\u20130.92); and OS: 12.4 months versus 16.6 months, HR 1.34 (95%CI: 0.95\u20131.90)]. In patients with PD-L1 with TC0 and IC0, results were similar in PFS and OS [PFS: 5.7 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.64\u20131.03); and OS: 13.8 months versus 12.5 months, HR 0.86 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.15)]. Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [2, 75\u201377] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study; and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [75, 77]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum- containing chemotherapy is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown.

Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PS 2, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown.

An individual-patient data meta-analysis that containing these two studies compared six courses with five or fewer courses demonstrated that PFS was significantly prolonged by six courses of treatment, but OS was similar [99].\n            Recent phase III trials mostly defined the maximum number of courses of platinum-based chemotherapy as four to six. In a phase III trial comparing CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (JMDB study), the median number of courses of CDDP treatment was five in both arms [76].\n            Based on this evidence, six or fewer courses of platinum-based chemotherapy are strongly recommended.

In addition, one of the analyses reported prolongation of OS [100, 101]. On the other hand, toxicity\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3, such as proteinuria, hypertension, hemorrhagic events, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and treatment-related death, were significantly increased by adding bevacizumab [100\u2013102].In a phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX (ECOG4599 study), prolongation of OS and PFS was demonstrated [PFS: 6.2 months versus 4.5 months, HR 0.66 (95%CI: 0.57\u20130.77), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 12.3 months versus 10.3 months, HR 0.79 (95%CI: 0.67\u20130.92), p\u2009=\u20090.003] [103]. ORR was also improved. On the other hand, in another phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (AVAiL study), PFS was prolonged, but OS was similar [104]. In a Japanese phase II trial (JO19907 study) using the same regimen as in ECOG4599, ORR and PFS were better [ORR: 60.7% versus 31.0%, PFS: 6.9 months versus 5.9 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI 0.42\u20130.89), p\u2009=\u20090.009], but OS was not prolonged [22.8 months versus 23.4 months, HR 0.99 (0.65\u20131.50)] [105]. In China, a phase III trial (BEYOND study) also using the same regimen as in ECOG4599 was conducted [106]. That trial demonstrated prolongation of both PFS and OS [PFS: 9.2 months versus 6.5 months, HR 0.40 (95%CI: 0.29\u20130.54), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 24.3 months versus 17.7 months, HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.93), p\u2009=\u20090.0154].Based on this evidence, addition of bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and <\u200975\u00a0years old.

In another combined analysis, of ECOG4599 and the PointBreak study, benefits of OS and PFS were less, especially in patients who were >\u200975\u00a0years old [108]. In a retrospective study conducted in the US (ARIES study), efficacy was similar between patients age below 65, between 65 and 75, and those above 75 years, but arterial thrombosis\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 tended to be increased in the elderly subset (1.5% <\u200965 years, 2.9% \u2265\u200965 years, and 3.5% \u2265\u200975\u00a0years) [109]. In a cohort study conducted in Europe (SAiL study), efficacy was similar between patients aged below and above 70 years, but hemorrhagic events tended to be increased in the elderly subset (3.5% <\u200970 years, 5.3% \u2265\u200970\u00a0years). In Japan, there are no sufficient data of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in the elderly.Based on this evidence, not to add bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old.

In the maintenance arm, QOL was not deteriorated. Toxicity was higher, but manageable. Another phase III trial compared maintenance PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab with bevacizumab after CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (AVAPERL study) [113]. In that trial, PFS was significantly prolonged [7.4 months versus 3.7 months, HR 0.48 (95%CI: 0.44\u20130.75), p\u2009<\u20090.0001], but OS was not significant.Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, continuation maintenance with pemetrexed is strongly recommended.We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.

However, there was a limitation that crossover rate to PEM in the placebo arm was low (18%).Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of platinum-based chemotherapy without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, switch maintenance with pemetrexed is weakly recommended.

However, considering milder toxicity of these agents compared with cytotoxic drugs, many guideline committee members supported PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as an option for this population. On the other hand, ORR of these drugs was 10\u201320% in the previous reports. Once they are not effective, the guideline committee also recommends a prompt change to cytotoxic chemotherapy.Based on this evidence, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is strongly recommended in patients who progressed with the first-line treatment.

Regarding evidence of DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM, refer to CQ 30.\n            In a phase III trial comparing PEM with DTX, non-inferiority of OS was not demonstrated [8.3 months versus 7.9 months, HR 0.99 (95%CI: 0.80\u20131.20)], but seemed similar. Regarding toxicity, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (grade 3\u20134) and alopecia (any grade) were increased in DTX arm. In non-squamous cell lung cancer subset, OS was longer in PEM arm [9.3 months versus 8.0 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI 0.61-1.00), p\u2009=\u20090.076] [126, 127].\n            An East Asian phase III trial comparing S-1 with DTX in patients with PS 0\u20132 as their second- or third-line treatment was conducted [128]. Non-inferiority of OS was demonstrated [12.8 months versus 12.5 months, HR 0.95 (95%CI 0.83\u20131.07), p\u2009=\u20090.38]. ORR and PFS were similar (ORR: 8.3% versus 9.9%, mPFS: 2.9 months in both arms). Regarding toxicity, neutropenia\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 and febrile neutropenia were higher in DTX arm (0.9% versus 13.6% and 5.4% versus 47.7%, respectively), while diarrhea\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 and oral mucositis were higher in S-1 arm (37.2% versus 18.2% and 23.9% versus 14.5%, respectively).\n            Based on this evidence, DTX+/-RAM, PEM, or S-1 is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20132 as their second- or further-line treatment.

ORR and PFS were also prolonged (ORR: 23% versus 14%, mPFS: 4.5 months versus 3.0 months). Regarding toxicity, neutropenia\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3, febrile neutropenia, platelet decreased (any grade), and mucositis were higher in DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM arm. Hypertension\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 was 6% and most hemorrhagic events were grade 1\u20132.In a Japanese randomized phase II trial (JVCG study), PFS tended to be longer [5.2 months versus 4.2 months, HR 0.83 (95%CI 0.59\u20131.16)] [130]. Tendency in ORR and OS were similar (ORR: 28.9% versus 18.5%, OS 15.2 months versus 13.9 months). Febrile neutropenia was commonly observed in DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM arm (34% versus 19%).Based on this evidence, addition of RAM to DTX is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131.

This study included both EGFR-mutated and wild-type patients.\n            On the contrary, in another phase III trial, which compared erlotinib with DTX in patients who were EGFR wild-type (TAILOR study), OS was significantly prolonged in DTX arm [8.2 months versus 5.4 months, HR 0.73 (95%CI 0.53-1.00), p\u2009=\u20090.05] [132]. In Japan, erlotinib was compared with DTX in a phase III trial [133]. In a subset of EGFR wild-type patients, PFS was superior in DTX arm [2.9 months versus 1.3 months, HR 1.57 (95%CI 1.18\u20132.11), p\u2009<\u20090.01].\n            Recently, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM demonstrated superiority to DTX, and S-1 demonstrated non-inferiority to DTX. Considering this situation, efficacy of erlotinib is relatively low. In addition, those patients who were EGFR wild-type had some clinical risk factors of interstitial lung disease with EGFR-TKI.\n            Based on this evidence, not to administer erlotinib is weakly recommended in patients who are EGFR wild-type or unknown.

In another meta-analysis, comparing second-generation agent with third-generation agent as a part of a platinum-based regimen, the latter was found to be superior, with ORR of 12% and 1-year survival rate of 6% [2]. In a Japanese phase III trial (FACS study), four regimens of platinum agents plus third-generation agents were compared, and their efficacies were similar [75].\n            Newer agents demonstrated the efficacy in several phase III studies, but some showed their efficacy on specific histology types. PEM is one typical example and is approved for non-squamous cell lung cancer. In study JMDB, comparing cisplatin (CDDP)\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009gemcitabine (GEM), efficacy results were similar in overall population. However, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM showed better OS in non-squamous cell lung cancer [11.8 versus 10.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.70\u20130.94), p\u2009=\u20090.005], while inferior OS was shown in squamous cell lung cancer [9.4 months versus 10.8 months, HR 1.23 (95%CI: 1.00\u20131.51), p\u2009=\u20090.05] [76]. Even though this was a subset analysis, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM are considered one of the preferred regimens for non-squamous cell lung cancer in terms of efficacy and safety. Regarding CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM, although there has been no phase III trial to investigate its OS benefit, it is commonly used due to its milder non-hematologic toxicity than CDDP. In randomized studies comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009DTX, or CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab, superiority in OS or safety was not demonstrated [77\u201379]. On the other hand, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of OS seemed to be similar between CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [79], and PFS of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab tended to be better than CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [80]. Based on these results, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM can be considered as a first-line treatment regimen.\n            For squamous cell lung cancer, a Japanese phase III trial comparing CDGP\u2009+\u2009DTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX was conducted [81]. OS was significantly prolonged in CDGP arm [13.6 months versus 11.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.02), p\u2009=\u20090.037]. Regarding toxicity, leukopenia, neutropenia, and platelet count decrease were common in CDGP arm, while nausea, fatigue, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were common in CDDP arm. This was the only regimen to show OS superiority in Japan.\n            In other phase III trials of S-1, non-superiority was demonstrated comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX against CDDP\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX [82, 83]. In a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX, significant ORR improvement was demonstrated [33.0% versus 25.0 months, response rate ratio 1.31 (95%CI: 1.08\u20131.59), p\u2009=\u20090.005] [84]. These regimens can be used regardless of histology.\n            Based on this evidence, combination of platinum agent and third- or later-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and younger than 75\u00a0years old.

They also reported that instrumental ADL, not chronological age, was associated with better prognosis. Another report mentioned that octogenarian patients did not show worse OS than younger patients (7\u00a0months versus 11 months, p\u2009=\u20090.20) and they also had similar safety result, even when they had PS of 0\u20131 [86]. These reports suggest that elderly patients should not be excluded from anti-cancer treatment due to their chronological age.\n            \nPhase III trials demonstrated that vinorelbine (VNR) prolonged OS compared with BSC, and also showed that GEM had similar efficacy to VNR [87, 88]. In a Japanese phase III trial (WJTOG9904 study) comparing DTX with VNR, PFS was significantly prolonged in DTX arm [5.5 months versus 3.1 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.82), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS was favorable in DTX arm, but without statistical significance [14.3 months versus 9.9 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.56\u20131.09), p\u2009=\u20090.138] [89].\n\n            Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old.

The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)For elderly NSCLC patients, two phase III trials comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy with third-generation drug monotherapy were reported, and most of the participants were \u2265\u200975\u00a0years old. Of those, the Japanese study (JCOG-0803/WJOG-4307L) compared weekly CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX with DTX [90]. Interim analysis showed that combination treatment was not superior to monotherapy in OS [13.3\u00a0months versus 14.8 months, HR 1.18 (95% CI: 0.83\u20131.69)], which resulted in early termination. Study IFCT0501 compared CBDCA\u2009+\u2009weekly PTX with GEM or VNR [91]. PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in combination arm [PFS: 6.0\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.62), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 10.3\u00a0months versus 6.2 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.78), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. However, these results were not more satisfactory than DTX monotherapy in a Japanese trial, and treatment-related deaths were relatively high in combination arm (4.4%). In addition, dosing of combination arm was unfamiliar in Japanese clinical practice. These results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.\n\n            Based on this evidence, CBDCA doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old.

In a subset of a meta-analysis comparing chemotherapy with BSC, OS was prolonged by chemotherapy regardless of PS [6% improvement in 1-year OS rate in patients with PS\u2009\u2265\u20092 (14% versus 8%)] [1].\n            \nA meta-analysis comparing the third-generation drugs (DTX, PTX, VNR, or GEM) with BSC demonstrated 7% of improvement in 1-year OS rate [2]. In this study, about 30% of patients had PS 2. From the three trials that were included in this meta-analysis, subset analyses of patients with PS 2 were reported, and each of the OS results tended to be prolonged [92].Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)A phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with PTX (CALGB9730 study), subset analysis of PS 2 showed that 1-year survival rate was improved in the combination arm [18% versus 10%, HR 0.60 (95%CI: 0.40\u20130.91), p\u2009=\u20090.016] [93]. In ECOG1599 study comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM in patients with PS 2, OS was 6.2\u00a0months and 6.9 months, respectively, and these regimens were considered as feasible [94]. In a randomized phase II trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM with GEM, OS and PFS tended to be longer [OS: 6.7\u00a0months versus 4.8\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.49), PFS: 4.1\u00a0months versus 3.0\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.36)] [95]. Recently, a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with PEM was conducted [96]. This study had some limitations: only 205 patients were enrolled, which was relatively small as a phase III trial, and the inclusion of squamous cell lung cancer was allowed. However, OS was significantly improved in the combination arm [9.3\u00a0months versus 5.3 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.46\u20130.83), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. PFS was also improved [5.8\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.35\u20130.63), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Regarding toxicity, anemia and neutropenia were common in the combination arm and treatment-related death was observed in 3.9% of the patients.Based on this evidence, platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2. The guideline committee calls attention to the clinicians that this evidence is limited, and most regimens in these trials were CBDCA-based or reduced-dosed.

In an interim analysis, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [8.8 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.52 (95%CI: 0.43\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (secondary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [median not reached versus 11.3 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 1\u201349%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 9.0 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.55 (95%CI: 0.37\u20130.81); and OS: median not reached versus 12.9 months, HR 0.55 (95%CI: 0.34\u20130.90)]. In patients with PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 6.1 months versus 5.1 months, HR 0.75 (95%CI: 0.53\u20131.05); and OS: 15.2 months versus 12.0 months, HR 0.59 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.92)]. Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (arm C) were reported [21] PFS (one of co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [8.3 months versus 6.8 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.74), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS (another co-primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [19.2 months versus 14.7 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64-96), p\u2009=\u20090.02]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC1/2 or IC1/2, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 8.3 months versus 6.6 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.41\u20130.77); and OS: 20.3 months versus 16.4 months, HR 0.80 (95%CI: 0.55\u20131.15)]. In patients with PD-L1 with TC0 and IC0, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 7.1 months versus 6.9 months, HR 0.77 (95%CI: 0.61\u20130.99); and OS: 17.1 months versus 14.1 months, HR 0.82 (95%CI: 0.62\u20131.08)]. Main adverse events were appetite loss, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were slightly higher (58.5% versus 50.0%). In chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, immune-related adverse events such as skin rash, liver dysfunction, thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, and colitis were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            \n(a-2)Squamous cell lung cancer.\n\n            A phase III trial comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (KEYNOTE-407 study) [22]. In this trial, 559 patients were randomized. In an interim analysis, PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [6.4 months versus 4.8 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.70), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (another primary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [15.9 months versus 11.3 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.49\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.0008]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 1\u201349%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 7.2 months versus 5.2 months, HR 0.56 (95%CI: 0.39\u20130.80); and OS: 14.0 months versus 11.6 months, HR 0.57 (95%CI: 0.57\u20130.90)]. In patients with PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 6.3 months versus 5.3 months, HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.47\u20130.98); and OS: 15.9 months versus 10.2 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.98)]. Main adverse events were anemia, appetite loss, neutropenia, and nausea in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (69.8% versus 68.2%). On the other hand, treatment-related deaths were higher in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm (3.6% versus 2.1%).\n            Another phase III trial, comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, was conducted in stage IV, squamous cell lung cancer patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER131 study). Results of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX plus atezolizumab (arm B) and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX (arm C) were reported [23]. PFS (one of the co-primary endpoints) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm [6.3 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60\u20130.85), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. However, improvement of OS (another co-primary endpoint) was not shown at the time of this interim analysis [14.0 months versus 13.9 months, HR 0.96 (95%CI: 0.78\u20131.18), p\u2009=\u20090.6931]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 with TC1/2 or IC1/2, PFS tended to be longer, but OS was not prolonged [PFS: 6.0 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.70(95%CI: 0.53\u20130.92); and OS: 12.4 months versus 16.6 months, HR 1.34 (95%CI: 0.95\u20131.90)]. In patients with PD-L1 with TC0 and IC0, results were similar in PFS and OS [PFS: 5.7 months versus 5.6 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.64\u20131.03); and OS: 13.8 months versus 12.5 months, HR 0.86 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.15)]. Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [2, 75\u201377] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study; and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [75, 77]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum- containing chemotherapy is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation78%(21/27)22%(6/27)000\n\n            \n(b)As four phase III trials comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor with platinum-based chemotherapy allowed enrollment of patients with PS 0\u20131 [20\u201323], there has been no efficacy or safety data of platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in stage IV NSCLC patients with PS 2. Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PS 2, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown. The guideline committee finally determined that there is insufficient evidence to draw a firm conclusion on this CQ. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation0074%(20/27)22%(6/27)4%(1/27)\n\n          \n          \n            CQ 24\n            What is the recommended number of courses of platinum-based chemotherapy?\n            Recommendation:\n            Six or fewer courses of platinum-based chemotherapy are strongly recommended.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: C\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            Comments:\n            Two phase III trials comparing three or four courses of combination chemotherapy consisting of platinum and third-generation agent with six courses of the same regimen both showed that 1-year survival and OS were similar, while toxicity was milder with the former [97, 98]. An individual-patient data meta-analysis that containing these two studies compared six courses with five or fewer courses demonstrated that PFS was significantly prolonged by six courses of treatment, but OS was similar [99].\n            Recent phase III trials mostly defined the maximum number of courses of platinum-based chemotherapy as four to six. In a phase III trial comparing CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (JMDB study), the median number of courses of CDDP treatment was five in both arms [76].\n            Based on this evidence, six or fewer courses of platinum-based chemotherapy are strongly recommended.

In addition, one of the analyses reported prolongation of OS [100, 101]. On the other hand, toxicity\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3, such as proteinuria, hypertension, hemorrhagic events, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and treatment-related death, were significantly increased by adding bevacizumab [100\u2013102].In a phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX (ECOG4599 study), prolongation of OS and PFS was demonstrated [PFS: 6.2 months versus 4.5 months, HR 0.66 (95%CI: 0.57\u20130.77), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 12.3 months versus 10.3 months, HR 0.79 (95%CI: 0.67\u20130.92), p\u2009=\u20090.003] [103]. ORR was also improved. On the other hand, in another phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (AVAiL study), PFS was prolonged, but OS was similar [104]. In a Japanese phase II trial (JO19907 study) using the same regimen as in ECOG4599, ORR and PFS were better [ORR: 60.7% versus 31.0%, PFS: 6.9 months versus 5.9 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI 0.42\u20130.89), p\u2009=\u20090.009], but OS was not prolonged [22.8 months versus 23.4 months, HR 0.99 (0.65\u20131.50)] [105]. In China, a phase III trial (BEYOND study) also using the same regimen as in ECOG4599 was conducted [106]. That trial demonstrated prolongation of both PFS and OS [PFS: 9.2 months versus 6.5 months, HR 0.40 (95%CI: 0.29\u20130.54), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 24.3 months versus 17.7 months, HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.93), p\u2009=\u20090.0154].Based on this evidence, addition of bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and <\u200975\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation27%(7/26)73%(19/26)000\n\n            \n(b)ElderlyIn a subset analysis of ECOG4599 study, the elderly population (>\u200970\u00a0years old) did not benefit from addition of bevacizumab, but showed increase of neutropenia, bleeding, and proteinuria\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 [107]. In another combined analysis, of ECOG4599 and the PointBreak study, benefits of OS and PFS were less, especially in patients who were >\u200975\u00a0years old [108]. In a retrospective study conducted in the US (ARIES study), efficacy was similar between patients age below 65, between 65 and 75, and those above 75 years, but arterial thrombosis\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 tended to be increased in the elderly subset (1.5% <\u200965 years, 2.9% \u2265\u200965 years, and 3.5% \u2265\u200975\u00a0years) [109]. In a cohort study conducted in Europe (SAiL study), efficacy was similar between patients aged below and above 70 years, but hemorrhagic events tended to be increased in the elderly subset (3.5% <\u200970 years, 5.3% \u2265\u200970\u00a0years). In Japan, there are no sufficient data of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in the elderly.Based on this evidence, not to add bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as C and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation004%(1/26)96%(25/26)0\n\n            \n(c)PS 2Regarding bevacizumab, as most of the clinical trials and observational studies consisted of patients with PS 0\u20131, there are few data regarding efficacy and toxicity in patients with PS 2 [109, 110].

Switch maintenance involves the introduction of a new agent. Continuation maintenance involves the continuation of an agent other than a platinum agent.\n            Comments:\n            \nIn a phase III trial of continuation maintenance with PEM after CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM (PARAMOUNT study), PFS and OS were significantly prolonged [PFS: 4.1 months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.73), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64\u20130.96), p\u2009=\u20090.0195] [112]. In the maintenance arm, QOL was not deteriorated. Toxicity was higher, but manageable. Another phase III trial compared maintenance PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab with bevacizumab after CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (AVAPERL study) [113]. In that trial, PFS was significantly prolonged [7.4 months versus 3.7 months, HR 0.48 (95%CI: 0.44\u20130.75), p\u2009<\u20090.0001], but OS was not significant.Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, continuation maintenance with pemetrexed is strongly recommended.We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(26/26)0000\n\n            \n(b)In a phase III trial of switch maintenance with PEM after platinum-doublet chemotherapy, PFS and OS were significantly prolonged [PFS: 4.3 months versus 2.6 months, HR 0.50 (95%CI: 0.42\u20130.61), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; and OS: 13.4 months versus 10.6 months, HR 0.79 (95%CI: 0.65\u20130.95), p\u2009=\u20090.012] [114]. However, there was a limitation that crossover rate to PEM in the placebo arm was low (18%).Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of platinum-based chemotherapy without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, switch maintenance with pemetrexed is weakly recommended. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2.

Regarding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, clinical trials enrolled mainly patients with PS 0\u20131. Efficacy and safety data were unknown in patients with PS 3\u20134. In a phase III trial, erlotinib was compared with BSC in patients with poor PS or concomitant disease (TOPICAL study [117]). Median age of participants was 77, 30% had PS 3, and 52% were EGFR wild-type. OS (primary endpoint) was not prolonged [3.7 months versus 3.6 months, HR 0.94 (95%CI: 0.81\u20131.10), p\u2009=\u20090.46].\n            Based on this evidence, not to administer any chemotherapy is strongly recommended. We judged quality of evidence as D and strength of recommendation as 1.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation0000100%(25/25)\nCQ 20\n            Is cytotoxic chemotherapy recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with PS 0\u20131 and younger than 75\u00a0years old, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown?\n            Recommendation:\n            Combination of platinum agent and third- or later-generation drug is strongly recommended.\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate 93%\n            Comments:\n            A meta-analysis demonstrated that platinum-based chemotherapy significantly prolonged OS compared with BSC [1]. In another meta-analysis, comparing second-generation agent with third-generation agent as a part of a platinum-based regimen, the latter was found to be superior, with ORR of 12% and 1-year survival rate of 6% [2]. In a Japanese phase III trial (FACS study), four regimens of platinum agents plus third-generation agents were compared, and their efficacies were similar [75].\n            Newer agents demonstrated the efficacy in several phase III studies, but some showed their efficacy on specific histology types. PEM is one typical example and is approved for non-squamous cell lung cancer. In study JMDB, comparing cisplatin (CDDP)\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009gemcitabine (GEM), efficacy results were similar in overall population. However, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM showed better OS in non-squamous cell lung cancer [11.8 versus 10.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.70\u20130.94), p\u2009=\u20090.005], while inferior OS was shown in squamous cell lung cancer [9.4 months versus 10.8 months, HR 1.23 (95%CI: 1.00\u20131.51), p\u2009=\u20090.05] [76]. Even though this was a subset analysis, CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM are considered one of the preferred regimens for non-squamous cell lung cancer in terms of efficacy and safety. Regarding CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM, although there has been no phase III trial to investigate its OS benefit, it is commonly used due to its milder non-hematologic toxicity than CDDP. In randomized studies comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009DTX, or CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab, superiority in OS or safety was not demonstrated [77\u201379]. On the other hand, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of OS seemed to be similar between CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [79], and PFS of CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab tended to be better than CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab [80]. Based on these results, CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM can be considered as a first-line treatment regimen.\n            For squamous cell lung cancer, a Japanese phase III trial comparing CDGP\u2009+\u2009DTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX was conducted [81]. OS was significantly prolonged in CDGP arm [13.6 months versus 11.4 months, HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.65\u20131.02), p\u2009=\u20090.037]. Regarding toxicity, leukopenia, neutropenia, and platelet count decrease were common in CDGP arm, while nausea, fatigue, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were common in CDDP arm. This was the only regimen to show OS superiority in Japan.\n            In other phase III trials of S-1, non-superiority was demonstrated comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX against CDDP\u2009+\u2009S-1 with CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX [82, 83]. In a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009nab-PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX, significant ORR improvement was demonstrated [33.0% versus 25.0 months, response rate ratio 1.31 (95%CI: 1.08\u20131.59), p\u2009=\u20090.005] [84]. These regimens can be used regardless of histology.\n            Based on this evidence, combination of platinum agent and third- or later-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and younger than 75\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation93%(25/27)7%(2/27)000\nCQ 21\n            Is cytotoxic chemotherapy recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown?\n            Recommendation:\n            \nMonotherapy using third-generation drug is strongly recommended.\n\n            Recommendation: 1\n            Evidence level: A\n            Agreement rate 100%\n            \n(b)CBDCA doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended.\n\n            Recommendation: 2\n            Evidence level: B\n            Agreement rate 74%\n            Comments:\n            In a post hoc analysis of a phase III trial of first-line treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy, efficacy was similar between those who were younger than 65\u00a0years and who were 65\u00a0years of age or older [85]. They also reported that instrumental ADL, not chronological age, was associated with better prognosis. Another report mentioned that octogenarian patients did not show worse OS than younger patients (7\u00a0months versus 11 months, p\u2009=\u20090.20) and they also had similar safety result, even when they had PS of 0\u20131 [86]. These reports suggest that elderly patients should not be excluded from anti-cancer treatment due to their chronological age.\n            \nPhase III trials demonstrated that vinorelbine (VNR) prolonged OS compared with BSC, and also showed that GEM had similar efficacy to VNR [87, 88]. In a Japanese phase III trial (WJTOG9904 study) comparing DTX with VNR, PFS was significantly prolonged in DTX arm [5.5 months versus 3.1 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI: 0.45\u20130.82), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. OS was favorable in DTX arm, but without statistical significance [14.3 months versus 9.9 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI: 0.56\u20131.09), p\u2009=\u20090.138] [89].\n\n            Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)For elderly NSCLC patients, two phase III trials comparing platinum-doublet chemotherapy with third-generation drug monotherapy were reported, and most of the participants were \u2265\u200975\u00a0years old. Of those, the Japanese study (JCOG-0803/WJOG-4307L) compared weekly CDDP\u2009+\u2009DTX with DTX [90]. Interim analysis showed that combination treatment was not superior to monotherapy in OS [13.3\u00a0months versus 14.8 months, HR 1.18 (95% CI: 0.83\u20131.69)], which resulted in early termination. Study IFCT0501 compared CBDCA\u2009+\u2009weekly PTX with GEM or VNR [91]. PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in combination arm [PFS: 6.0\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42\u20130.62), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 10.3\u00a0months versus 6.2 months, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.52\u20130.78), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. However, these results were not more satisfactory than DTX monotherapy in a Japanese trial, and treatment-related deaths were relatively high in combination arm (4.4%). In addition, dosing of combination arm was unfamiliar in Japanese clinical practice. These results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.\n\n            Based on this evidence, CBDCA doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and older than 75\u00a0years old. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 1.

In a subset of a meta-analysis comparing chemotherapy with BSC, OS was prolonged by chemotherapy regardless of PS [6% improvement in 1-year OS rate in patients with PS\u2009\u2265\u20092 (14% versus 8%)] [1].\n            \nA meta-analysis comparing the third-generation drugs (DTX, PTX, VNR, or GEM) with BSC demonstrated 7% of improvement in 1-year OS rate [2]. In this study, about 30% of patients had PS 2. From the three trials that were included in this meta-analysis, subset analyses of patients with PS 2 were reported, and each of the OS results tended to be prolonged [92].Based on this evidence, monotherapy using a third-generation drug is strongly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as A and strength of recommendation as 2. The results of voting by committee members to determine this recommendation are described below.\n\n            Involved members regarding this voting: sub-committee on chemotherapy (medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients)\n            \nBenefit with strong recommendationBenefit with weak recommendationUnable to determine recommendationNo benefit or risk with weak recommendationNo benefit or risk with strong recommendation100%(27/27)0000\n\n            \n(b)A phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with PTX (CALGB9730 study), subset analysis of PS 2 showed that 1-year survival rate was improved in the combination arm [18% versus 10%, HR 0.60 (95%CI: 0.40\u20130.91), p\u2009=\u20090.016] [93]. In ECOG1599 study comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM in patients with PS 2, OS was 6.2\u00a0months and 6.9 months, respectively, and these regimens were considered as feasible [94]. In a randomized phase II trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009GEM with GEM, OS and PFS tended to be longer [OS: 6.7\u00a0months versus 4.8\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.49), PFS: 4.1\u00a0months versus 3.0\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.36)] [95]. Recently, a phase III trial comparing CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PEM with PEM was conducted [96]. This study had some limitations: only 205 patients were enrolled, which was relatively small as a phase III trial, and the inclusion of squamous cell lung cancer was allowed. However, OS was significantly improved in the combination arm [9.3\u00a0months versus 5.3 months, HR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.46\u20130.83), p\u2009=\u20090.001]. PFS was also improved [5.8\u00a0months versus 2.8 months, HR 0.46 (95%CI: 0.35\u20130.63), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Regarding toxicity, anemia and neutropenia were common in the combination arm and treatment-related death was observed in 3.9% of the patients.Based on this evidence, platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 2. We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 2. The guideline committee calls attention to the clinicians that this evidence is limited, and most regimens in these trials were CBDCA-based or reduced-dosed.

In an interim analysis, PFS (primary endpoint) was significantly prolonged in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm [8.8 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.52 (95%CI: 0.43\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. OS (secondary endpoint) was also significantly prolonged [median not reached versus 11.3 months, HR 0.49 (95%CI: 0.38\u20130.64), p\u2009<\u20090.0001]. In a subset analysis of PD-L1 1\u201349%, both PFS and OS were prolonged [PFS: 9.0 months versus 4.9 months, HR 0.55 (95%CI: 0.37\u20130.81); and OS: median not reached versus 12.9 months, HR 0.55 (95%CI: 0.34\u20130.90)].

Main adverse events were nausea, anemia, fatigue, and constipation in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, and adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were similar (67.2% versus 65.8%). On the other hand, in chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab arm, acute kidney injury and immune-related adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were observed in 5.2% and 8.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial lung disease were reported. Careful management should be applied.\n            Another phase III trial comparing platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy was conducted in stage IV, non-squamous NSCLC patients with PS 0\u20131 (IMPOWER150 study).

Adverse events\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 were higher (69% versus 58%) in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm.\n            Regarding elderly patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old, these four trials [2, 75\u201377] allowed registration of this population. In two trials using atezolizumab, subgroup analyses were reported. Both trials showed that PFS was better in the chemotherapy plus atezolizumab arm, even in the elderly [9.7\u00a0months versus 6.8\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower150 study; and 7.0\u00a0months versus 5.6\u00a0months (HR 0.78) in the IMpower131 study] [75, 77]. However, safety data were not reported in this population. Careful management should be applied.\n            Based on this evidence, addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum- containing chemotherapy is strongly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown.

Basically, there are some safety concerns regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy in this population. Thus, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy may not be tolerable.Based on this, there is no clear evidence to recommend the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PS 2, when their tumor is driver oncogene-negative and PD-L1 is <\u200950%, or unknown.

An individual-patient data meta-analysis that containing these two studies compared six courses with five or fewer courses demonstrated that PFS was significantly prolonged by six courses of treatment, but OS was similar [99].\n            Recent phase III trials mostly defined the maximum number of courses of platinum-based chemotherapy as four to six. In a phase III trial comparing CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (JMDB study), the median number of courses of CDDP treatment was five in both arms [76].\n            Based on this evidence, six or fewer courses of platinum-based chemotherapy are strongly recommended.

In addition, one of the analyses reported prolongation of OS [100, 101]. On the other hand, toxicity\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3, such as proteinuria, hypertension, hemorrhagic events, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and treatment-related death, were significantly increased by adding bevacizumab [100\u2013102].In a phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX with CBDCA\u2009+\u2009PTX (ECOG4599 study), prolongation of OS and PFS was demonstrated [PFS: 6.2 months versus 4.5 months, HR 0.66 (95%CI: 0.57\u20130.77), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 12.3 months versus 10.3 months, HR 0.79 (95%CI: 0.67\u20130.92), p\u2009=\u20090.003] [103]. ORR was also improved. On the other hand, in another phase III trial comparing bevacizumab and CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM with CDDP\u2009+\u2009GEM (AVAiL study), PFS was prolonged, but OS was similar [104]. In a Japanese phase II trial (JO19907 study) using the same regimen as in ECOG4599, ORR and PFS were better [ORR: 60.7% versus 31.0%, PFS: 6.9 months versus 5.9 months, HR 0.61 (95%CI 0.42\u20130.89), p\u2009=\u20090.009], but OS was not prolonged [22.8 months versus 23.4 months, HR 0.99 (0.65\u20131.50)] [105]. In China, a phase III trial (BEYOND study) also using the same regimen as in ECOG4599 was conducted [106]. That trial demonstrated prolongation of both PFS and OS [PFS: 9.2 months versus 6.5 months, HR 0.40 (95%CI: 0.29\u20130.54), p\u2009<\u20090.001; and OS: 24.3 months versus 17.7 months, HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.93), p\u2009=\u20090.0154].Based on this evidence, addition of bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients with PS 0\u20131 and <\u200975\u00a0years old.

In another combined analysis, of ECOG4599 and the PointBreak study, benefits of OS and PFS were less, especially in patients who were >\u200975\u00a0years old [108]. In a retrospective study conducted in the US (ARIES study), efficacy was similar between patients age below 65, between 65 and 75, and those above 75 years, but arterial thrombosis\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 tended to be increased in the elderly subset (1.5% <\u200965 years, 2.9% \u2265\u200965 years, and 3.5% \u2265\u200975\u00a0years) [109]. In a cohort study conducted in Europe (SAiL study), efficacy was similar between patients aged below and above 70 years, but hemorrhagic events tended to be increased in the elderly subset (3.5% <\u200970 years, 5.3% \u2265\u200970\u00a0years). In Japan, there are no sufficient data of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in the elderly.Based on this evidence, not to add bevacizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is weakly recommended in patients\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years old.

In the maintenance arm, QOL was not deteriorated. Toxicity was higher, but manageable. Another phase III trial compared maintenance PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab with bevacizumab after CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (AVAPERL study) [113]. In that trial, PFS was significantly prolonged [7.4 months versus 3.7 months, HR 0.48 (95%CI: 0.44\u20130.75), p\u2009<\u20090.0001], but OS was not significant.Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of CDDP\u2009+\u2009PEM without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, continuation maintenance with pemetrexed is strongly recommended.We judged quality of evidence as B and strength of recommendation as 1.

However, there was a limitation that crossover rate to PEM in the placebo arm was low (18%).Based on this evidence, in patients who received four courses of platinum-based chemotherapy without disease progression and with tolerable toxicity, switch maintenance with pemetrexed is weakly recommended.

In TAX-320 study, DTX 75\u00a0mg/m2 showed improvement in ORR, PFS rate at 26 weeks, and OS rate at 1\u00a0year compared with VNR or IFM, although they were not statistically significant [123]. In another study, comparing DTX 75\u00a0mg/m2 with BSC, MST and OS rate at 1\u00a0year were superior in DTX arm (7.5\u00a0months versus 4.6 months, 37% versus 19%, respectively), and QOL was also improved [124]. In a Japanese phase II trial, 60\u00a0mg/m2 of DTX showed relatively similar efficacy (ORR 18.2% and OS 7.8\u00a0months) [125]. Regarding evidence of DTX\u2009+\u2009RAM, refer to CQ 30.\n            In a phase III trial comparing PEM with DTX, non-inferiority of OS was not demonstrated [8.3 months versus 7.9 months, HR 0.99 (95%CI: 0.80\u20131.20)], but seemed similar. Regarding toxicity, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (grade 3\u20134) and alopecia (any grade) were increased in DTX arm.

Studies with nivolumab or atezolizumab were conducted regardless of PD-L1 expression (CheckMate-017 study, CheckMate-057 study, OAK study [118\u2013120]), while a study of pembrolizumab was conducted only in patients whose tumor expressed PD-L1\u2009>\u20091% (KEYNOTE-010 study [121]).These trials enrolled patients with PS 0\u20131; thus, efficacy and safety data of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with PS 2 in the second-line setting were unclear. However, considering milder toxicity of these agents compared with cytotoxic drugs, many guideline committee members supported PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as an option for this population. On the other hand, ORR of these drugs was 10\u201320% in the previous reports.
