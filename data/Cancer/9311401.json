    "description": "Introduction\n      Lung cancer led to 1.8 million deaths in 2020, and remains the leading cause of cancer\u2010related deaths globally [1]. Notable therapeutic improvements, such as the introduction of immunotherapy, have led to improved outcomes in a limited number of patients with late\u2010stage (stage IV) lung cancer; however, prognosis remains poor for the majority of lung cancer patients [2]. Low\u2010dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening (LCS) offers a promising solution to the early detection of lung cancer, and subsequently could significantly reduce lung cancer mortality. Multiple LCS studies have provided indisputable evidence for the benefits of LDCT LCS [3, 4]. However, LDCT LCS programs are yet to be implemented on a large scale globally. This review will highlight both the benefits and future challenges associated with the large\u2010scale implementation of LCS programs. We will examine the existing supporting evidence for LDCT LCS, gathered during extensive national LCS trials. Additionally, we will outline important obstacles that still need to be overcome, such as optimal selection of screening population, screening interval, the most appropriate nodule management protocol, cost effectiveness, infrastructure, participant compliance, and incorporation of smoking cessation programs. All of the aforementioned are crucial factors in the successful global implementation of LDCT LCS.\nLDCT LCS trial evidence\n      Various randomized control trials (RCTs) have now taken place in both the United States and Europe to evaluate the effectiveness of LDCT LCS, many of which show promising results.\n      The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Nederlands\u2010Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) trial are two trials with adequate power to evaluate reduction in lung cancer mortality, both of which showed LDCT screening could significantly reduce lung cancer mortality in a high\u2010risk population [3, 5, 6]. The NLST began in 2002 and recruited 53,454 participants, aged 55\u201374 years, who were either current or former smokers with at least 30\u2010pack\u2010years smoking history and who were at high risk of developing lung cancer. Participants were randomized into either a LDCT or chest X\u2010ray screening group and underwent annual screening over 3 years. This trial reported an overall 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8\u201326.7; p = 0.004) reduction in lung cancer mortality after 6.5\u2010years follow\u2010up when using LDCT compared to chest X\u2010ray for LCS [3]. In contrast, the NELSON trial compared LDCT screening at baseline, year 1, year 3, and year 5.5 to no screening. This study, which began its first recruitment in 2003, included 15,792 participants aged 50\u201374 years with a high risk of developing lung cancer\u2014both smokers and former smokers with \u226530 pack\u2010years smoking history. In 2020, the NELSON trial published their final results, reporting a cumulative rate ratio for lung cancer death of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61\u20130.94; p = 0.01) in the screening arm relative to the control arm after a follow\u2010up of 10 years [4].\n      Additional RCTs that have taken place in Europe, despite being underpowered for the evaluation of lung cancer mortality reduction, have shown similar encouraging results. The Multicentric Italian Lung Detection (MILD) trial compared LDCT screening to no intervention in participants aged \u226549\u00a0years with \u226520 pack\u2010years smoking history, and found a significant 39% reduction in the cumulative risk of lung cancer mortality at 10 years in the LDCT arm of the trial (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI, 0.30\u20130.95; p = 0.02) [7]. The German Lung Cancer Screening Intervention (LUSI) RCT also compared LDCT to no intervention, and found a statistically significant reduction in lung cancer mortality in women (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10\u20130.96; p = 0.04) in the LDCT arm [8]. Numerous other trials also showed a nonsignificant reduction in lung cancer mortality when comparing LDCT screening to either chest X\u2010ray or no intervention [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

After including the NELSON results, the evidence was graded as high and the recommendation followed for annual LCS with LDCT in adults aged 50\u201380 years who have a 20 pack\u2010year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person develops a health problem substantially limiting life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery [14].\nOptimal selection of a screening population\n      Appropriate selection of a high\u2010risk population for LDCT LCS is imperative for screening to be effective and to reduce associated harms, such as radiation exposure. Most LDCT LCS trials have selected participants based on age and smoking status, and as mentioned previously, they have shown significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when using LDCT screening. However, age and smoking status are not the only lung cancer risk factors. Family history, genetic polymorphisms, existing respiratory illnesses, ionizing radiation, occupational exposures, and air pollution have all been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer [15]. Consequently, multiple lung cancer risk\u2010prediction models have been developed and externally validated [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. So far, the UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) trial is the only RCT to use a lung cancer risk\u2010prediction model to select a high\u2010risk population for an LCS trial [23]. The UKLS trial included participants aged 50\u201375 years, with \u22655% risk of developing lung cancer within 5 years based on the LLPv2 risk model. This risk model was externally validated on data from three independent studies and showed modest to good discrimination, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.67\u20130.82. The following risk factors are included in the model to determine a 5\u2010year risk of lung cancer: age, sex, history of malignancy, smoking duration, family history of lung cancer including age of onset, asbestos exposure, and history of pneumonia [24]. The PLCOM2012 risk model has also shown promising results in calculating a 6\u2010year risk of lung cancer. After external validation, this model shows good discrimination with an AUC of 0.797. When compared to the NLST criteria for selecting a high\u2010risk population, the PLCOM2012 risk model had both a higher sensitivity (83.0% vs. 71.1%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and positive predictive value (4.0% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.01), and no loss of sensitivity [22]. Therefore, the use of a risk\u2010prediction model for participant selection in an LCS program could improve effectivity and research should now be focused on further fine tuning and independent validation of existing risk\u2010prediction models. An overview of the variables included in the various lung cancer risk\u2010prediction models can be seen in Fig.\u00a01.\n      \n        Fig. 1\n        \n          Summary of variables included in existing lung cancer risk\u2010prediction models. BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; PY, pack\u2010years.\nLDCT\u2010screening frequency\n      LDCT LCS, as with any screening program, does not come without possible harm, one of which is radiation exposure that participants receive during their scan. Therefore, it is important to consider factors that affect the benefit\u2013harm ratio of LCS, one of which is screening interval. A short screening interval could lead to a reduction in interval cancers (cancers detected between screening rounds), and in turn also a reduction in the detection of late\u2010stage lung cancer. However, a short interval does involve increased radiation exposure, costs, and a possible increase in false\u2010positive results, hence the importance of finding the appropriate balance.\n      The NLST had annual screening over a period of 3 years [25], whereas the NELSON trial used screening intervals of 1 year, then 2 years, and then 2.5 years. After an interval of 2.5 years, more interval cancers were detected, of which significantly more were late stage. Consequently, it was concluded that a screening interval of 2.5 years likely leads to a decrease in effectivity of a screening trial [26]. However, the use of annual versus biennial screening is still being debated. The MILD trial compared annual versus biennial screening, and found no significant difference in the number of interval cancers [27].\n      Based on existing evidence from LCS trials and modeling studies from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) [28], Canada and the United States recommend annual screening intervals [28, 29]. However, in favor of conserving costs, other countries may choose biennial screening. Baldwin et\u00a0al. suggest several approaches for selecting screening intervals [30]. The first is adjusting screening frequency based on a person's lung cancer risk, meaning those with a higher 5\u2010year risk of lung cancer would have a shorter screening interval. The second is adjusting screening frequency based on the presence of baseline lung nodules and new nodules detected. However, as the others state, this is not supported by evidence from existing LCS trials.\nLung\u2010nodule management\n      For LCS to be effective, lung\u2010nodule management needs to be optimal. Based on existing LDCT\u2010screening trial data, approximately 50% of the screened participants have \u2265 1 nodule detected at baseline [2, 31, 32]. Importantly, more than half of the nodules detected are small in size\u2014<50 mm3 or maximum diameter <5 mm [33, 34, 35]\u2014and lung cancer probability does not correlate with the number of nodules detected [36]. Furthermore, in the NELSON trial, 5%\u20137% of participants who underwent LDCT screening had a new solid nodule at follow\u2010up. Even when small in size, these new nodules had a higher risk of malignancy; however, the number of new nodules did not directly relate to malignancy risk [37, 38]. These results suggest that each lung nodule should be assessed on an independent basis, for which multiple lung\u2010nodule management guidelines have been introduced.\n      Lung nodules are assessed predominantely based on size, growth, and type. During the NLST, lung\u2010nodule size measurement was based on maximum diameter. This was also recommended in the early version (1.0) of the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung\u2010RADS) guideline and the Fleischner Society guidelines [39, 40]. However, the NLST reported a substantial number of false\u2010positive results (24%), which is thought to be largely due to the use of maximum diameter measurements. This hypothesis was supported when the NELSON trial reported a reduction in false\u2010positive results through the use of volumetric size measurements [4, 41]. Henceforth, volume\u2010based lung\u2010nodule measurement has been recommended in/added to subsequent guidelines\u2014Lung\u2010RADS v1.1, European Position Statement on Lung Cancer (EUPS), British Thoracic Society guidelines, and NELSON\u2010Plus protocol [2, 42, 43, 44]. Nodule growth at follow\u2010up screening can also be more accurately detected when using volumetric measurements in place of diameter, and can be used for the calculation of volume doubling time (VDT) [45]. VDT represents the exponential growth of a lung nodule, and can subsequently be used for determining nodule management and follow\u2010up.\n      The nodule type has also been shown to be consequential to the risk of malignancy. Nodules can be classified into calcified and noncalcified, with the latter being further classified into solid and subsolid (part\u2010solid and pure\u2010ground glass). Solid nodules are most prevalent in lung cancer screening. However, subsolid nodules are associated with a higher malignancy risk, albeit they are usually detected at a premalignant or early stage [46, 47, 48]. Furthermore, a nodule's risk of malignancy can also be related to other distinguishing characteristics, such as location and attachment. In the NELSON trial for example, 82.2% of adenocarcinomas were detected in the periphery (outer one\u2010third of the hilar\u2010costal diameter) of the lungs and were attached to the pleura compared to 17.8% detected in the middle or centrally (inner two\u2010thirds of the hilar\u2010costal diameter). Additionally, 45.0% of all lung cancers were situated in the right upper lobe [49]. Thus, these results affirm the suggestion that nodule management should be decided on an independent nodule to nodule basis. Computed tomography (CT) images of solid and subsolid nodules can be seen in Fig.\u00a02.\n      \n        Fig. 2\n        \n          Computed tomography images showing solid and subsolid lung nodules: (a) mixed ground\u2010glass malignant (invasive adenocarcinoma) nodule peripherally situated in the left upper lobe measuring 25\u00a0mm max. diameter. (b) Mixed ground\u2010glass malignant (invasive adenocarcinoma) nodule situated peripherally in the left upper lobe measuring 14\u00a0mm max. diameter. (c) Solid benign nodule is situated peripherally in the left lower lobe measuring 248\u00a0mm3. (d) Pure ground\u2010glass malignant (adenocarcinoma in situ) nodule situated peripherally in the right upper lobe measuring 14\u00a0mm max. diameter.\nCost effectiveness of LDCT LCS\n      Numerous LCS cost\u2010effectiveness studies have been performed and results have been variable. A health technology assessment performed by Snowsill et\u00a0al. in 2018 evaluated the use of LDCT in screening for lung cancer in high\u2010risk UK populations and concluded that the cost effectiveness and clinical effectiveness remained uncertain [50]. A more recently published microsimulation modelling study by Du et\u00a0al. in 2020 based on a Dutch population found LDCT LCS to be cost effective in a high\u2010risk population. They reported LDCT LCS was most cost effective when performed annually in males aged 55\u201380 years who were heavy smokers, and biennially in females aged 50\u201380 years who were heavy smokers [51]. Similar results were found in a cost\u2010effectiveness analysis performed in Switzerland [52], and to a lesser degree in a German population [53].\n      Outside of Europe, similar analyses have been performed. In the United States, Criss et\u00a0al. used four independently developed microsimulation models to evaluate the cost effectiveness of LCS according to the maximum age recommendations of the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) (80 years), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (77 years), and the NLST (74 years). They reported all of the aforementioned screening strategies to be cost effective, with incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $96,700, $68,600, and $49,200, respectively\u2014all of which fall under the willingness\u2010to\u2010pay threshold in the United States of $100,000 per quality\u2010adjusted\u2010life\u2010year (QALY) [54]. In Canada, Ten Haaf et\u00a0al. found LDCT screening of persons aged 55\u201375 with a smoking history of \u226540 pack years resulted in a cost\u2010effectiveness ratio of $41,136 Canadian dollars per life\u2010years gained, again falling under the threshold of $50,000 Canadian dollars [55], whereas a simulation study in an Australian population based on NLST selection criteria found LDCT screening unlikely to be cost effective. They reported an ICER of $233,000 Australian dollars per QALY gained, falling above the willingness\u2010to\u2010pay threshold in Australia of $30,000\u2013$50,000 Australian dollars per QALY [56].\n      The cost effectiveness of LDCT LCS undoubtedly varies according to the country in which screening is to be implemented. This suggests that the implementation strategy of the LCS program should be specific to the country in which it is to be implemented. Cost\u2010effectiveness analyses should therefore now be focused on country\u2010specific health and social care infrastructure and perspectives.\nArtificial intelligence in LCS\n      Implementing LDCT LCS globally is no easy feat, essentially due to the substantial increase in workload that radiologists face. Radiologists are under ever\u2010increasing pressure in the clinic due to significant workforce shortages and an unrelenting demand for radiological services [57]. Demand will only increase with the implementation of CT LCS, and consequently a solution is required. Artificial intelligence (AI) could offer the solution.\n      \n        AI and lung\u2010nodule detection\n        AI systems that can be used in LCS have shown significant improvement over the decades. Different methods of using an AI system to assist a human reader have been investigated\u2014as a first reader, second reader, or a concurrent reader [58]. AI as a first reader is the optimal strategy when looking to reduce the radiologists\u2019 workload, as the human reader only reviews the nodules deemed clinically significant by the AI system. However, this method requires the highest degree of accuracy to avoid dangerous false\u2010negative (undetected clinically significant nodules) results. AI as second reader works to improve the overall performance of the human reader. The human reader performs an independent initial read, followed by an AI\u2010system read, and subsequently comparisons are made to identify missed or misclassified nodules. Lastly, a concurrent read involves the human reader using the entire read of the AI system to assist with their final interpretation.\n        Computer\u2010aided detection (CAD) systems that can act as a \u201csecond reader\u201d for the radiologist have shown promise in improving the accuracy of nodule detection [59]. Rubin et\u00a0al. showed that CAD used as a second reader for pulmonary nodule detection substantially increased mean sensitivity from 63% (range, 56%\u201367%) to 76% (range, 73%\u201378%) when compared to a conventional double human read [60]. Liang et\u00a0al. retrospectively compared four CAD systems to radiologists\u2019 reads performed in the I\u2010ELCAP study. They showed that CAD systems were able to identify up to 70% of lung cancers that were missed by radiologists, but missed 20% of lung cancers that were identified by radiologists. These results also suggest that the use of these CAD systems as a second reader would be advantageous in LDCT LCS [61]. This promising result has also been replicated in numerous other publications [62, 63, 64].\n        Concurrent reading using CAD systems has also been proven to be effective. Silva et\u00a0al. investigated the use of a CAD system for the detection of subsolid nodules in the MILD trial. In this study, CAD had a higher sensitivity than visual readings; however, human visual confirmation of CAD markings was required to reduce the number of false\u2010positive findings. This outcome suggests that a concurrent reading using both CAD and human visual reading provides the optimal detection of subsolid lung nodules [65].\n        Despite significant supporting evidence showing the value of CAD systems in detection of pulmonary nodules, they are yet to be implemented in clinical practice. This is largely due to suboptimal sensitivity and specificity outcomes associated with the existing systems. Continuous fine tuning of existing CAD systems will hopefully lead to a reduction in false\u2010negative and positive results, and in turn they could be successfully implemented in LDCT LCS programs.\n      \n      \n        AI and lung\u2010nodule classification\n        A different approach to the use of AI in LDCT LCS is lung\u2010nodule classification using radiomics or deep learning (DL) models to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules. Radiomics are computer algorithms that can extract a large amount of quantitative data from regions of interest on CT scans. These data can, for example, include variables relating to shape, voxel gray level intensity, and spatial relationships. Thus, the aim of radiomics in LCS is to develop new imaging biomarkers that could help differentiate between malignant and benign nodules [66]. Liu et\u00a0al. used radiomic models to differentiate between adenocarcinomas and benign lesions detected using LDCT, and found a higher specificity and equivalent sensitivity when compared to the Lung\u2010RADS classification system [67]. Radiomics could also help with the timely planning of individual\u2010based LCS intervals, as previously suggested by Wang et\u00a0al. This group proposed a radiomics\u2010based follow\u2010up schedule and assessed its performance in comparison to five existing management guidelines. They reported that their proposed radiomic\u2010based schedule performed better than the five existing guidelines when looking at timely lung cancer diagnosis and preventing unnecessary follow\u2010up screening [68]. Similarly, DL models show potential in the field of LCS. Heuvelmans et\u00a0al. trained a lung cancer prediction convolutional neural network (LCP\u2010CNN) using NLST data to predict the malignancy score for lung nodules. The LCP\u2010CNN performance was excellent in ruling out benign lung nodules when tested independently in a European trial dataset [69]. Baldwin et\u00a0al. tested the same LCP\u2010CNN model in a UK dataset, and compared it with the Brock University model for the estimation of lung\u2010nodules malignancy risk. They found that LCP\u2010CNN was better able to discriminate between benign and malignant nodules than the Brock model [70]. Liu et\u00a0al. compared the performance of a DL model to that of radiologists. Their results showed that the performance of the DL model was not dependent on the radiation dose, patient age, or the CT scanner used, and when used by a radiologist their performance improved and overall reading time decreased [71].\n        Alternatively, in place of AI differentiating between benign and malignant lung nodules, workload reduction can be achieved by correctly classifying nodules by size. A recent study on the performance of AI for categorization of lung nodules based on volumetric size measurement showed that AI could outperform four experienced radiologists when looking at negative misclassifications, resulting in a possible workload reduction of up to 86.7% [72].\nAI and lung\u2010nodule detection\n        AI systems that can be used in LCS have shown significant improvement over the decades. Different methods of using an AI system to assist a human reader have been investigated\u2014as a first reader, second reader, or a concurrent reader [58]. AI as a first reader is the optimal strategy when looking to reduce the radiologists\u2019 workload, as the human reader only reviews the nodules deemed clinically significant by the AI system. However, this method requires the highest degree of accuracy to avoid dangerous false\u2010negative (undetected clinically significant nodules) results. AI as second reader works to improve the overall performance of the human reader. The human reader performs an independent initial read, followed by an AI\u2010system read, and subsequently comparisons are made to identify missed or misclassified nodules. Lastly, a concurrent read involves the human reader using the entire read of the AI system to assist with their final interpretation.\n        Computer\u2010aided detection (CAD) systems that can act as a \u201csecond reader\u201d for the radiologist have shown promise in improving the accuracy of nodule detection [59]. Rubin et\u00a0al. showed that CAD used as a second reader for pulmonary nodule detection substantially increased mean sensitivity from 63% (range, 56%\u201367%) to 76% (range, 73%\u201378%) when compared to a conventional double human read [60]. Liang et\u00a0al. retrospectively compared four CAD systems to radiologists\u2019 reads performed in the I\u2010ELCAP study. They showed that CAD systems were able to identify up to 70% of lung cancers that were missed by radiologists, but missed 20% of lung cancers that were identified by radiologists. These results also suggest that the use of these CAD systems as a second reader would be advantageous in LDCT LCS [61]. This promising result has also been replicated in numerous other publications [62, 63, 64].\n        Concurrent reading using CAD systems has also been proven to be effective. Silva et\u00a0al. investigated the use of a CAD system for the detection of subsolid nodules in the MILD trial. In this study, CAD had a higher sensitivity than visual readings; however, human visual confirmation of CAD markings was required to reduce the number of false\u2010positive findings.

Several factors can affect participant recruitment and adherence, such as socio\u2010economic status, age, gender, smoking status, and family history of lung cancer.\n      Ali et\u00a0al. analyzed barriers to participation in the UKLS trial. They found that persons who declined participation were more likely: female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), individuals >65 years of age (OR 0.73, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), current smokers (OR 0.70, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), of lower socioeconomic status (OR 0.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and had higher affective risk perception (OR 0.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) [73]. A study by Lopez\u2010Olivo et\u00a0al. looked at participant adherence to LCS in the United States. They found current smokers were less likely than former smokers to adhere to LCS (OR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62\u20130.80), and persons who had completed \u22654 college years showed increased adherence than those who had not (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1\u20132.1) [74]. Kim et\u00a0al. analyzed adherence in participants screened for lung cancer within the Lung Population\u2010based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR) Consortium. In a multivariable analysis, they found that Black participants had a lower adherence in comparison to White patients (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66\u20130.94), and former smokers had increased adherence when compared with current smokers (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19\u20131.49) [75]. A summary of factors associated with participant recruitment and adherence can be seen in Fig.\u00a03.\n      \n        Fig. 3\n        \n          Summary of factors associated with participant recruitment and adherence in low\u2010dose computed tomography lung cancer screening programs.\n        \n        \n      \n      To overcome participant recruitment and adherence issues, various techniques have been investigated. Lam et\u00a0al. reported interventions, including dedicated program coordinators, reminder letters and calls, and mobile CT scanners, helped to reduce nonadherence in LDCT LCS [76]. For the successful implementation of LCS, adherence issues must be overcome. Further research into recruitment and adherence interventions would therefore be beneficial before LCS is implemented widespread.\nIncorporation of smoking cessation programs\n      LCS should not replace preventative measures such as smoking cessation programs. Nevertheless, lung cancer mortality cannot be reduced by preventative measures alone. Therefore, it has been recommended that smoking cessation programs be integrated into LCS. The EUPS suggested smoking cessation guidance be given to all current smokers recruited in LCS programs [43].\n      When association between smoking abstinence and mortality in NLST participants has been assessed, it is reported that lung cancer mortality reduction is greater when abstinence is combined with LCS [77, 78]. Ashraf et\u00a0al. examined the smoking habits of Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) participants and reported an increase in the annual point prevalence quit rate from 11% to 24% over the five screening rounds, with no relapse amongst ex\u2010smokers [79]. Similar positive effects of smoking cessations programs were also found in the ITALUNG trial. Pistelli et\u00a0al. report a threefold significantly greater probability of quitting smoking when participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program. Furthermore, smoking cessation was associated with male gender, lower pack\u2010years, and the presence of pulmonary nodules at baseline [80]. In UKLS participants, LCS also provided a teachable moment, with smoking cessation rates of 14% versus 8% at baseline in the screened versus control group, respectively (OR 2.38; 95% CI, 1.56\u20133.64, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In this trial, participants requiring additional investigations had an increased likelihood of quitting long term when compared with the control group (OR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.62\u20133.22, p = 0.007) [81]. In the NELSON trial, the screening group also reported high smoking abstinence rates (14.5%); however, higher rates were still seen in the control group [82].\n      LCS offers a teachable moment for smoking cessation and therefore the integration of cessation programs should be considered. Further research into the optimal strategy for such programs is still necessary, along with further behavioral research.\nImplementation pilots and studies\n      Multiple countries, including the UK, Croatia, and Poland, have now started pilot testing LCS programs [83, 84, 85]. However, as previously discussed, there are many factors that affect successful implementation, and implementation will require continuous monitoring to maintain optimal standards. Henceforth, the 4\u2010IN\u2010THE\u2010LUNG\u2010RUN project (an acronym for Towards Individually tailored Invitations, screening INtervals and INtegrated comorbidity reducing strategies in LCS) has been set up with the ultimate goal of implementing a Europe\u2010wide, cost\u2010effective volume\u2010based CT LCS program for high\u2010risk individuals, taking into consideration individuals\u2019 backgrounds and gender [86]. The 4\u2010IN\u2010THE\u2010LUNG\u2010RUN project is a multicentered implementation trial, and will include participants from five European countries. It is hoped that this trial will provide answers to the remaining questions surrounding LCS implementation in Europe.\nConclusion\n      LCS through the use of LDCT can reduce lung cancer mortality. This has now been undeniably proven in multiple RCTs. Therefore, LDCT LCS in high\u2010risk populations is on the brink of implementation. However, to achieve optimal outcomes, research into factors associated with LDCT\u2010screening implementation is still necessary. Shifting the focus to this type of research will help to achieve the fundamental goal of implementing accessible, affordable, and applicable CT screening programs in Europe for high\u2010risk individuals. Once implemented, continuous monitoring of participant eligibility, lung cancer detection rate, false\u2010positive/negative rates, LCS interval, adherence and referral rate, and CT radiation exposure will be required to ensure efficacy.\nConflict of interest\n      The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nAuthor contributions\n      Harriet L.
