    "description": "Introduction\n      Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.[1] Owing to the lack of early symptoms, over 80% of lung cancer cases present with advanced/metastatic diseases.[2] Metastases spread from an initial primary tumor to distant sites where secondary tumors are seeded, and represent the main cause of cancer-related mortality.[3] Given that early stage cancer remains asymptomatic, most patients with lung cancer present with locally advanced, or widely metastatic tumors upon diagnosis, resulting in reduced life expectancy.[4] Despite remarkable advances in standard therapy, treatment remains complex and comprises surgical resection, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies. The dormancy of metastatic cancer cells within the metastatic microenvironment is a primary contributor to treatment failure as most current available therapeutic strategies target actively proliferating cells.[5] Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches must be established to deliver drugs based on a specific metastasis cascade phase.\n      Immunotherapy has proven to be a promising option for targeting metastasis as the activity of the immune system is less influenced by cancer cell metabolism.[6] Additionally, metastatic cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), including circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), are readily cleared by the host immune response.[7] However, the antitumor immune response is restricted by immunosuppressive TMEs characterized by low pH, a reductive environment, high-level reactive oxygen species and glutathione, a hypoxic status, overexpressed enzymes, high-level adenosine triphosphate,[8] and abnormal expression levels of stress proteins,[9] thus facilitating tumor metastasis.[10] Mechanically, tumor cells can achieve immune escape by targeting platelets and macrophages.[11] Therefore, immunotherapy aimed at either activating the immune response or inhibiting immunosuppressive activity is a promising strategy for controlling metastasis and has revolutionized the metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment landscape.[4] The ability of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to restore the T cell-mediated antitumor response has transformed current approaches for treating multiple solid tumors, including lung cancer.[4] In 2015, nivolumab, a fully human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) interaction, became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved for NSCLC treatment.[12] Subsequently, over the past 5 years, an increasing number of ICIs have been approved for monotherapy or combinatorial therapy with other agents for metastatic lung cancer [Table 1].\n      \n        Table 1\n        \n          FDA-approved immunotherapies targeting metastatic lung cancer in the clinical stage over the past 5 years (2017\u20132022).\n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Generic name (brand name)\n              Description\n              Trial name (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier)\n              Disease setting\n              FDA approval\n              Study phase\n              Approval year\n              Reference\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)\n              Humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody\n              KEYNOTE-042 (NCT02220894)\n              Stage III NSCLC not candidate for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or mNSCLC;

(2) targeting established metastases by remodeling the TME.[2] Notably, nanomedicine-based strategies have faced some limitations, including infusion reactions,[15] biological barriers to drug delivery,[16] inefficient targeting of nanomaterials to the desired tissues and cells, inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, variability among patients, and toxicity.[17] Nonetheless, various nanomedicines have been approved for marketing or are currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials for metastatic lung cancer [Table 2].\n      \n        Table 2\n        \n          Nanomedicine-based therapy for metastatic lung cancer approved for marketing or under clinical trial.\n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Name\n              Description\n              Nanoparticle-associated advantage\n              Patient population\n              Therapy approval\n              Primary outcome\n              Most common grade \u22653 AEs\n              Study phase/FDA approval year\n              Ref./Clinical Trials.gov Identifier\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Nab-paclitaxel\n              Low-dose nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel\n              Enhanced immune response to tislelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody)\n              29 Patients aged \u226565 years with advanced NSCLC\n              \u22651st Line of chemotherapy or targeted therapy\n              Median PFS = 9.5 months, OS = 16.5 months\n              Grade 3 AEs (n = 3, 10.3%)\n              II\n              \n[96]\n\n            \n            \n              Genexol-PM\n              Cremophor EL-free polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel\n              Improved delivery\n              43 Patients with advanced NSCLC\n              First-line treatment\n              Median PFS = 4.0 months (95% CI 2.0\u20136.0 months), median OS = 14.8 months (95% CI 9.1\u201320.5 months)\n              Neutropenia (n = 7, 16%), pneumonia (n = 5, 12%)\n              II\n              \n[97]\n\n            \n            \n              Abraxane/ABI-007\n              Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel\n              Improved solubility and delivery\n              1052 Untreated patients with stages IIIB\u2013IV NSCLC\n              First-line treatment\n              Overall response rate higher than that for solvent-based paclitaxel (33% vs. 25%, P = 0.005)\n              Grade \u22653 AEs (4%)\n              III/2012\n              \n[98]\n\n            \n            \n              NBTXR3\n              Hafnium oxide nanoparticles\n              Enhanced radiation\n              Patients with metastatic lung cancer\n              Radiotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody\n              \u2013\n              \u2013\n              I/II\n              NCT03589339\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            AE: Adverse event;

We also briefly discuss the challenges in this research area and future clinical translation.\nRole of the Microenvironment in Lung Cancer Metastasis\n      Tumor metastasis occurs in a series of discrete steps: (1) local tumor invasion from the primary tumor into the surrounding stroma through basement membrane degradation; (2) tumor cell migration, and survival, into the blood or lymphatic vessels (i.e., CTCs); (3) initial extravasation and survival of tumor cells in a supportive tissue microenvironment in preparation for metastatic tumor cells (i.e., premetastatic niche); (4) formation and progression of distant metastases.[2] Metastasis is an inefficient process with <0.1% of tumor cells surviving for 24 h and <0.01% undergoing metastasis after entering the circulation.[20,21] Research on NSCLC metastasis has focused on both non-tumor cell components and extracellular matrix components comprising the TME.[22] Micro-environmental interactions of solid cancer assist each of these steps.[23] Therefore, reconstruction of the TME could help regulate tumor cells from the source in a holistic manner, rather than single targeting.\n      The TME of solid cancer contains tumor cells and host stromal cells and proceeds through three phases, namely, elimination, equilibrium, and escape.[23] During the elimination phase, the innate and adaptive immune responses cooperate to recognize and kill cancer cells. Tumors capable of surviving this phase enter the equilibrium phase, wherein the tumor presents a partially immune indolent state. Finally, cancer cell growth is unrestricted due to the immunosuppressive TME, leading to metastasis in the escape phase.[24] Following adaptation to the new microenvironment of the primary tumor, metastatic tumor cells can disseminate and colonize to form secondary tumors in the organs, such as the brain, bones, liver, adrenal gland, and lymph nodes [Figure 1].\n      \n        Figure 1\n        \n          Steps and micro-environmental interactions of lung cancer metastasis.

Thus, characterizing the mechanisms responsible for the cooperation of tumor cells with the TME will contribute to the prevention of tumor metastasis in primary tumors and metastatic organs.\n      \n        Figure 2\n        \n          Nanotechnology-enabled immunotherapy by harnessing immune cells in primary and secondary lung cancer.

In fact, MSN carrying anti-PD-L1 antibody and indoximod were established to bind Annexin A1 expressed on caveolae of luminal tumor endothelial cells. Endocytosis of the NPs is initiated via caveolae, and the subsequent transcellular trafficking delivers nanocarriers that accumulate in the TME.[33] The MSN loaded with anti-PD-L1 antibody and indoximod elicits superior results than combination therapy of free drugs, leading to significant inhibition of orthotopic lung cancers with satisfying in vivo biocompatibility and tolerable toxicity.[33]\n      \n      \n        Regulating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway\n        Activating the STING pathway in the TME generates a strong antitumor response.[34] MnIIIPC@DTX@PLGA@Mn2+@HA, a new nanotechnology platform comprising photothermal therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, activates tumor immunity through cGAS-STING via releasing Mn2+ in A549 NSCLC cells, ultimately exerting synergistic therapeutic effects against NSCLC.[35] The immunogenicity of chlorin e6 (Ce6)-mediated photodynamic therapy is limited by its poor solubility, rapid clearance, and insufficient accumulation in lung cancer.[36] Meanwhile, the nanocarrier iron oxide (IO)\u2013polyaniline-based glyco (PG)\u2013GLU containing Ce6 potently promotes Ce6 accumulation in lung cancer tissues, damages DNA, activates the cGAS/STING axis, and upregulates the level of IFN-\u03b2, high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), ultimately improving the immunogenicity of LLC and augmenting efficacy with little adverse effects in LLC-bearing mice.[36]\n      \n      \n        Promoting polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages\n        Emerging evidence has demonstrated that macrophages manifest a pro-tumor phenotype after entering the TME owing to their pro-tumor role and simultaneous immunosuppression.[37] Mechanistically, macrophages expressing the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure facilitate Treg proliferation and IL-10 production, reduce CD8+ T cell activities, and block NK cell activation,[38] thus providing opportunities for M1 TAM-polarized cancer immunotherapy. For instance, the gold (Au)-based Au@PG NPs exhibit an M1 macrophage phenotype, accompanied by immunogenic cytokine release (reduced levels of immunosuppressive IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, and increased levels of immunogenic IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1).[39] The gold (Au)-based Au@PG NPs lead to tumor remodeling by switching the TME from cold to hot, thus contributing to the CTL response and tumor suppression without significant cytotoxicity. These results support the potential of Au@PG NPs in lung cancer immunotherapy.[39] In addition, toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 agonists, such as polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly [I:C]), are reportedly emerging as immunotherapy adjuvants for cancer.[40] Indeed, TLR3 agonist poly (I:C) NPs improve drug potency to induce M1 macrophages up to 100-fold via inducing autocrine type I IFNs and potentiating the synergistic interaction with TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 in an LLC murine model.[41]\n      \n      \n        Activating mature dendritic cells (DCs)\n        Immature DCs release transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and boost fork-head box P3 (FOXP3)+ Tregs, which in turn suppress CD8+ CTLs.[42] Multiple strategies have been established to target DCs to improve tumor immunotherapy.[43] Bio-compatible poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol NPs loaded with a doxorubicin (DOX) cytostatic agent and immune adjuvants (the endosomal TLR3 agonist poly [I:C] and TLR7/8 agonist R848, macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 chemokine), strongly stimulate DC activation, secrete IL-12, and increase CD8+ CTLs.[44] This leads to stronger tumor inhibition and longer overall survival relative to that of free components in a TC-1-bearing mouse model. Meanwhile, a cancer vaccine adjuvanted with nanoemulsion carrying R848 elicits potent local and systemic antitumor immunity,[45] leading to the reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME by activating tumor-specific T cells and reversing T cell exhaustion in subcutaneous and orthotopic lung cancer-bearing mice.[45] Moreover, its combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies synergistically prevents tumor recurrence and prolongs survival.[45] Additionally, DOX-loaded biomimetic hybrid nanovesicles (DOX@LINV) are an emerging drug delivery vehicle with augmented antitumor immune activity[46] that can be used for effective combination immunochemotherapy by applying artificial liposomes with tumor-derived nanovesicles.[46] The combination of DOX@LINV with ICIs boosts the antitumor effect, with 33.3% of mice being tumor-free following activation of DCs and subsequent triggering of antigen-specific T cell immunity. Additionally, the selective cell cytotoxicity of DOX@LINV on cancer cells instead of DC cells renders it a promising cancer-targeting therapeutic nanomedicine.[46]\n      \n      \n        Harnessing NK cells\n        NK cells also exert immune-suppressive effects in response to dysfunctional phenotypes, such as downregulated NK cell-activating receptors, loss of degranulation potential, decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression, and activated lung-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells.[47] However, the capacity of NK cells to constitute the first line of defense, linking innate and adaptive immune responses, renders them an ideal platform against cancer.[48] For instance, a magnetic nano-system for the delivery of Fe3O4@polydopamine-carrying NK cells reportedly suppresses tumor growth with no significant inflammatory, apoptotic, or necrotic cells in major organs, accompanied by decreased Ki-67 expression and augmented apoptosis in A549 lung cancer cells.[49]\n      \n      \n        Exploring other stromal cells\n        Additionally, CAFs are predominant cells accounting for almost 70% of cells within NSCLC stroma.[50] Moreover, neutrophils are the most prevalent immune cell type in the lung TME.[51] Given that tumor-associated neutrophils, TAMs, and MDSCs represent tumor-associated myeloid cells in the TME, NPs with unique physical properties of these cells that can efficiently and specifically penetrate the TME also warrant further investigation.\nBoosting CD8+ T lymphocyte cytotoxicity\n        The main hallmark of the immunosuppressive TME is the inactivation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).[26] Cationic NPs (PPCN) delivering both the herbal medicine podophyllotoxin and microRNA (miR)-424 to target PDL1 messenger RNA led to reduced PD-L1 production and enhanced CTL-mediated attack of cancer cells.[27] Consequently, the miR-424@PPCN complexes significantly suppressed tumor growth compared with either miR-424 or PPCNs alone in H460-bearing mice, without significant toxicity, and the survival of mice was extended.[27] Moreover, hyaluronic acid-cisplatin/polystyrene-polymetformin nano-prodrug treatment induced longer overall survival of Lewis lung cancer (LLC)-bearing mice compared to the parental drug, with tolerable systemic toxicity.[28] This effect partially resulted from an immune-active TME with increased proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, reduced number of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and elevated interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels.[29] Hyaluronic acid-cisplatin and polystyrene-polymetformin synergistically induce LLC cell apoptosis.[29]\nBlocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions\n        Tumors can trigger immune-suppressive signaling, such as cyclooxygenase 2, prostaglandin E2, PD-L1, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, thereby suppressing the activity of CD8+ CTLs.[4] Thus, self-assembled lipid bilayer NPs encapsulating podophyllotoxin reportedly inhibit PD-L1 expression and promote intratumoral CTL infiltration in lung cancer.[30] These effects lead to significant tumor growth inhibition by blunting tumor immune escape, yielding extended survival with reduced systemic toxicity of podophyllotoxin.[30] Moreover, the FX@HP nanocomplex comprising fluorinated polymerized C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 antagonism (FX) and paclitaxel-carried human serum albumin (HP) used for pulmonary delivery of anti-PD-L1 small-interfering (si) RNA, also induces CTL infiltration, enhances calreticulin expression by tumor cells, and reduces myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)/Treg abundance in the TME, thus achieving greater tumor inhibition and a longer survival time than the control polyethyleneimine/siPD-L1 group in orthotopic lung tumors.[31] Tumor immune-modulatory therapies that induce immunogenic cell death or inhibit immunosuppressive signaling may be rendered more effective via NP-based targeted delivery than systemic administration of the drug when combined with the blockade of immunosuppressive signaling.[32] For instance, cisplatin, the first approved platinum drug, upregulates PD-L1 expression in a time-dependent manner.[28] Poly(L-glutamic acid)-graft-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) complex NPs containing cisplatin improve the therapeutic response of PD-1/PD-L1 blockades partly via sustained elevated tumor PD-L1 expression in an LLC tumor mouse model.[28]\nTargeting endothelial cells\n        Endothelial cells influence vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis in tumors via multiple cell types, including tumor cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).[4] Therefore, endothelial cells can function as promising targets of cancer immunotherapy. In fact, MSN carrying anti-PD-L1 antibody and indoximod were established to bind Annexin A1 expressed on caveolae of luminal tumor endothelial cells. Endocytosis of the NPs is initiated via caveolae, and the subsequent transcellular trafficking delivers nanocarriers that accumulate in the TME.[33] The MSN loaded with anti-PD-L1 antibody and indoximod elicits superior results than combination therapy of free drugs, leading to significant inhibition of orthotopic lung cancers with satisfying in vivo biocompatibility and tolerable toxicity.[33]\nRegulating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway\n        Activating the STING pathway in the TME generates a strong antitumor response.[34] MnIIIPC@DTX@PLGA@Mn2+@HA, a new nanotechnology platform comprising photothermal therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, activates tumor immunity through cGAS-STING via releasing Mn2+ in A549 NSCLC cells, ultimately exerting synergistic therapeutic effects against NSCLC.[35] The immunogenicity of chlorin e6 (Ce6)-mediated photodynamic therapy is limited by its poor solubility, rapid clearance, and insufficient accumulation in lung cancer.[36] Meanwhile, the nanocarrier iron oxide (IO)\u2013polyaniline-based glyco (PG)\u2013GLU containing Ce6 potently promotes Ce6 accumulation in lung cancer tissues, damages DNA, activates the cGAS/STING axis, and upregulates the level of IFN-\u03b2, high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), ultimately improving the immunogenicity of LLC and augmenting efficacy with little adverse effects in LLC-bearing mice.[36]\nPromoting polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages\n        Emerging evidence has demonstrated that macrophages manifest a pro-tumor phenotype after entering the TME owing to their pro-tumor role and simultaneous immunosuppression.[37] Mechanistically, macrophages expressing the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure facilitate Treg proliferation and IL-10 production, reduce CD8+ T cell activities, and block NK cell activation,[38] thus providing opportunities for M1 TAM-polarized cancer immunotherapy. For instance, the gold (Au)-based Au@PG NPs exhibit an M1 macrophage phenotype, accompanied by immunogenic cytokine release (reduced levels of immunosuppressive IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, and increased levels of immunogenic IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1).[39] The gold (Au)-based Au@PG NPs lead to tumor remodeling by switching the TME from cold to hot, thus contributing to the CTL response and tumor suppression without significant cytotoxicity. These results support the potential of Au@PG NPs in lung cancer immunotherapy.[39] In addition, toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 agonists, such as polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly [I:C]), are reportedly emerging as immunotherapy adjuvants for cancer.[40] Indeed, TLR3 agonist poly (I:C) NPs improve drug potency to induce M1 macrophages up to 100-fold via inducing autocrine type I IFNs and potentiating the synergistic interaction with TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 in an LLC murine model.[41]\nActivating mature dendritic cells (DCs)\n        Immature DCs release transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and boost fork-head box P3 (FOXP3)+ Tregs, which in turn suppress CD8+ CTLs.[42] Multiple strategies have been established to target DCs to improve tumor immunotherapy.[43] Bio-compatible poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol NPs loaded with a doxorubicin (DOX) cytostatic agent and immune adjuvants (the endosomal TLR3 agonist poly [I:C] and TLR7/8 agonist R848, macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 chemokine), strongly stimulate DC activation, secrete IL-12, and increase CD8+ CTLs.[44] This leads to stronger tumor inhibition and longer overall survival relative to that of free components in a TC-1-bearing mouse model. Meanwhile, a cancer vaccine adjuvanted with nanoemulsion carrying R848 elicits potent local and systemic antitumor immunity,[45] leading to the reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME by activating tumor-specific T cells and reversing T cell exhaustion in subcutaneous and orthotopic lung cancer-bearing mice.[45] Moreover, its combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies synergistically prevents tumor recurrence and prolongs survival.[45] Additionally, DOX-loaded biomimetic hybrid nanovesicles (DOX@LINV) are an emerging drug delivery vehicle with augmented antitumor immune activity[46] that can be used for effective combination immunochemotherapy by applying artificial liposomes with tumor-derived nanovesicles.[46] The combination of DOX@LINV with ICIs boosts the antitumor effect, with 33.3% of mice being tumor-free following activation of DCs and subsequent triggering of antigen-specific T cell immunity. Additionally, the selective cell cytotoxicity of DOX@LINV on cancer cells instead of DC cells renders it a promising cancer-targeting therapeutic nanomedicine.[46]\nHarnessing NK cells\n        NK cells also exert immune-suppressive effects in response to dysfunctional phenotypes, such as downregulated NK cell-activating receptors, loss of degranulation potential, decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression, and activated lung-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells.[47] However, the capacity of NK cells to constitute the first line of defense, linking innate and adaptive immune responses, renders them an ideal platform against cancer.[48] For instance, a magnetic nano-system for the delivery of Fe3O4@polydopamine-carrying NK cells reportedly suppresses tumor growth with no significant inflammatory, apoptotic, or necrotic cells in major organs, accompanied by decreased Ki-67 expression and augmented apoptosis in A549 lung cancer cells.[49]\nExploring other stromal cells\n        Additionally, CAFs are predominant cells accounting for almost 70% of cells within NSCLC stroma.[50] Moreover, neutrophils are the most prevalent immune cell type in the lung TME.[51] Given that tumor-associated neutrophils, TAMs, and MDSCs represent tumor-associated myeloid cells in the TME, NPs with unique physical properties of these cells that can efficiently and specifically penetrate the TME also warrant further investigation.\nNanomedicine-based Strategy for Hijacking Circulation Cells\n      Based on the classic \u201cseed and soil\u201d hypothesis, CTCs may detach from the primary tumor, travel through the circulatory and lymphatic systems, shelter in a suitable TME for survival, and form secondary tumors, just like \u201cseeds\u201d germinating in a friendly \u201csoil\u201d (premetastatic niche).[52] Nevertheless, therapeutic outcomes of metastatic cancers remain poor, primarily owing to the poor detection and capture of CTCs in blood.[53] Despite being protected by platelets from immune elimination, CTCs are susceptible to immune clearance by NK cells, macrophages, T helper cells, and CTLs.[54] Thus, immunotherapeutic strategies tracing and inhibiting invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation, and infiltration of CTCs through TME modulation have tremendous potential as targets for lung cancer metastasis.[54]\n      However, to date, most NP-based platforms are focused on effectively capturing and detecting lung CTCs based on their positivity for CTC biomarkers, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecules, and cytokeratins.[55\u201357] Other strategies targeting CTCs, including blocking the immune checkpoint on CTCs, targeting the affinity between CTCs and platelets or neutrophils, and enhancing CTC apoptosis, should be further utilized to develop nanomedicine-based immunotherapy for treating lung cancer.[54,58]\nNanomedicine-based Strategy for Remodeling the Microenvironment in Distant Metastatic Organs\n      Prevention of initial metastasis at an early stage is ideal for cancer treatment. However, a large number of patients with a tumor are initially diagnosed at a metastatic stage.[59] While CTCs enter adjacent blood or lymphatic vessels, premetastatic niches are formed in distant sites following stimulation by inflammatory cytokines,[60] extracellular vesicles by bone marrow-derived DCs from a primary lung tumor,[61] and by sensing tumor exosomal RNAs via TLR3,[62] thereby providing a suitable TME for tumor progression. Thus, remodeling the inflammatory TME in premetastatic sites can impede CTC colonization.\n      After reaching secondary distant metastatic sites, CTCs extravasate from the blood circulation through enhanced endothelial intercellular gaps via endothelial morphologic changes.[63] Owing to their deformation capability facilitating the movement of CTCs through capillary beds,[64] capillary-rich organs, such as the liver, lungs, brain, and bones, are frequent sites of cancer metastases.[19] The proliferation and growth of CTCs in secondary sites can be further fueled by inflammatory factors and growth factors in the TME.[65] CTCs that survive in secondary organs (i.e., DTCs) can remain in the bone marrow for years, with only approximately 50% of patients presenting with overt metastasis [Figure 1].[66]\n      Analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in matched primary and metastatic foci, from patients with NSCLC, demonstrated a more immune tolerogenic TME with a lower level of CTLs in the secondary organs, e.g., lungs, brain, liver, distant lymph nodes, kidneys, and bones.[4] To activate a robust immunosupportive TME against cancer metastasis, it is critical to deliver sufficient immunostimulatory components, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), into desired regions, e.g., lymph nodes.[67] Owing to the capability of nanoplatforms, or the drugs they carry, to remodel the TME, significant focus has been placed on nanomedicine leveraging immune cells that participate in the metastatic process.[25] Cancer immunotherapies, such as cancer vaccines, artificial APC-based therapy, ICIs, and cell-based therapies, have achieved clinical efficiency with low toxicity by boosting antigen immunogenicity.[68,69] These NPs targeting different lung cancer-associated metastatic organs release various agents to targeted areas with excellent serum stability [Table 4].\n      \n        Table 4\n        \n          Nanomedicine therapies for lung cancer metastasis in

Pleural metastasis\n        Lung carcinomas frequently metastasize to the pleura. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a relatively common and fatal complication of terminal lung malignancies.[70] Meanwhile, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) is a second messenger that activates STING signaling, thus stimulating innate immunity.[71] cGAMP is susceptible to degradation by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, in MPE and serum.[72] In a mouse MPE model bearing LLC with MPE and multifocal tumors on the pleural surface, intrapleural injection of phosphatidylserine-coated liposomes in conjunction with a PD-L1 inhibitor reduced MPE volume.[70] Phospholipid-coated liposomes also demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in treating MPE, promoting CD8+ CTLs and NK cells via targeted activation of STING signaling in macrophages and DCs.[70] Moreover, combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a synergistic effect, including reducing MPE volume and suppressing tumor growth in the pleural cavity and lung parenchyma.\n      \n      \n        Liver metastasis\n        Liver metastases are commonly detected in lung cancer.[73] Ferumoxytol has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat iron deficiency; however, it can also polarize macrophage differentiation toward pro-inflammatory M1 TAMs.[74] Ferumoxytol NPs can be applied to protect against liver metastasis from small cell lung cancer by potentiating macrophage-modulating cancer immunotherapies with tolerable toxicity.[74] Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of hyaluronic acid-poly(ethyleneimine) NPs carrying miR-125b leads to a >6-fold higher ratio of M1/M2 macrophages and 300-fold elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (M1 marker)/Arg-1 (M2 marker) ratio in TAMs relative to the control group in the macrophage-ablated lungs of NSCLC mouse models.[75]\n      \n      \n        Pulmonary metastasis\n        Pulmonary metastasis is common in adenocarcinomas and small cell lung cancer.[76] NPs encapsulating human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were prepared and incorporated into a thermosensitive hydrogel to develop bFGF-NPs within a hydrogel composite (bFGF-NPs/hydrogel). The bFGF-NPs/hydrogel remarkably improved immunity by suppressing tumor formation, growth, and metastases in an LLC pulmonary metastasis murine model.[77] As mentioned earlier, TLR agonists have received considerable attention as stimulators of both innate and adaptive immunity. Local pulmonary injection of NP-bound TLR9 agonist CpG prolongs the upregulation of antitumor cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, formyl-peptide receptor 2, IL-12p40, and CXCL10, in the lungs.[78] They also augment CD8+ CTL and NK cell infiltration in two orthotopic metastatic mouse models of NSCLC-344SQ (lung adenocarcinoma) and KAL-LN2E1 (lung squamous carcinoma).[78] This strategy leads to lower toxicity and more effective inhibition of the tumor burden than soluble CpG.\n      \n      \n        Lymph node metastasis\n        Lymph node metastasis of lung cancer is an important factor associated with prognosis. Given that cancer cells can enter the circulation and form distant secondary tumors through lymph nodes, novel strategies blocking lymphatic metastasis should be investigated. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4), also called VEGF recptor 3, is a VEGF-C and D receptor that exerts critical effects in boosting tumor metastasis via triggering lymphangiogenesis in solid tumors.[79] Hence, T4 phage NPs with a cell-surface expression of mouse Flt4 (mFlt4) were constructed as recombinant vaccines,[79] which were found to suppress lung metastasis and inhibit lymphangiogenesis by generating specific anti-mFlt4 antibody-producing B cells.[79]\n      \n      \n        Abdominal metastasis\n        Forming therapeutic combinations based on biomedical nanotechnology is an effective approach for lung cancer metastasis treatment. Typically, abdominal metastasis of lung cancer has an unfavorable prognosis, with a median survival of <2 months.[80] However, celastrol NP-encapsulating M1-like macrophages (NP@M1) used in a combined therapeutic platform play dual roles, including facilitating the M1-like state and extending M1 TAM status. Moreover, the exocytosed celastrol NPs can directly kill cancer cells, thus inhibiting abdominal metastasis.[80] Additionally, NBTXR3, a radio-enhancer NP, has been approved for pre-operative local control of locally metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.[81] NBTXR3 evokes obvious abscopal effects in anti-PD-1-sensitive and anti-PD-1-resistant lung carcinoma, thus exhibiting potential for treating patients with metastatic lung cancer, despite sensitivity (or resistance) to immunotherapies, by facilitating CD8+ T cell infiltration.[81]\n        Despite the tremendous body of existing research related to organ-specific metastasis, a large number of patients suffer from metastasis in multiple organs. Therefore, identifying triggers of metastasis that are common to different cell types, organs, and tumor types, as well as the design of relevant nanotherapeutics, should be considered.\nPleural metastasis\n        Lung carcinomas frequently metastasize to the pleura. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a relatively common and fatal complication of terminal lung malignancies.[70] Meanwhile, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) is a second messenger that activates STING signaling, thus stimulating innate immunity.[71] cGAMP is susceptible to degradation by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, in MPE and serum.[72] In a mouse MPE model bearing LLC with MPE and multifocal tumors on the pleural surface, intrapleural injection of phosphatidylserine-coated liposomes in conjunction with a PD-L1 inhibitor reduced MPE volume.[70] Phospholipid-coated liposomes also demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in treating MPE, promoting CD8+ CTLs and NK cells via targeted activation of STING signaling in macrophages and DCs.[70] Moreover, combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a synergistic effect, including reducing MPE volume and suppressing tumor growth in the pleural cavity and lung parenchyma.\nLiver metastasis\n        Liver metastases are commonly detected in lung cancer.[73] Ferumoxytol has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat iron deficiency; however, it can also polarize macrophage differentiation toward pro-inflammatory M1 TAMs.[74] Ferumoxytol NPs can be applied to protect against liver metastasis from small cell lung cancer by potentiating macrophage-modulating cancer immunotherapies with tolerable toxicity.[74] Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of hyaluronic acid-poly(ethyleneimine) NPs carrying miR-125b leads to a >6-fold higher ratio of M1/M2 macrophages and 300-fold elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (M1 marker)/Arg-1 (M2 marker) ratio in TAMs relative to the control group in the macrophage-ablated lungs of NSCLC mouse models.[75]\nPulmonary metastasis\n        Pulmonary metastasis is common in adenocarcinomas and small cell lung cancer.[76] NPs encapsulating human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were prepared and incorporated into a thermosensitive hydrogel to develop bFGF-NPs within a hydrogel composite (bFGF-NPs/hydrogel). The bFGF-NPs/hydrogel remarkably improved immunity by suppressing tumor formation, growth, and metastases in an LLC pulmonary metastasis murine model.[77] As mentioned earlier, TLR agonists have received considerable attention as stimulators of both innate and adaptive immunity. Local pulmonary injection of NP-bound TLR9 agonist CpG prolongs the upregulation of antitumor cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, formyl-peptide receptor 2, IL-12p40, and CXCL10, in the lungs.[78] They also augment CD8+ CTL and NK cell infiltration in two orthotopic metastatic mouse models of NSCLC-344SQ (lung adenocarcinoma) and KAL-LN2E1 (lung squamous carcinoma).[78] This strategy leads to lower toxicity and more effective inhibition of the tumor burden than soluble CpG.\nLymph node metastasis\n        Lymph node metastasis of lung cancer is an important factor associated with prognosis. Given that cancer cells can enter the circulation and form distant secondary tumors through lymph nodes, novel strategies blocking lymphatic metastasis should be investigated. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4), also called VEGF recptor 3, is a VEGF-C and D receptor that exerts critical effects in boosting tumor metastasis via triggering lymphangiogenesis in solid tumors.[79] Hence, T4 phage NPs with a cell-surface expression of mouse Flt4 (mFlt4) were constructed as recombinant vaccines,[79] which were found to suppress lung metastasis and inhibit lymphangiogenesis by generating specific anti-mFlt4 antibody-producing B cells.[79]\nAbdominal metastasis\n        Forming therapeutic combinations based on biomedical nanotechnology is an effective approach for lung cancer metastasis treatment. Typically, abdominal metastasis of lung cancer has an unfavorable prognosis, with a median survival of <2 months.[80] However, celastrol NP-encapsulating M1-like macrophages (NP@M1) used in a combined therapeutic platform play dual roles, including facilitating the M1-like state and extending M1 TAM status. Moreover, the exocytosed celastrol NPs can directly kill cancer cells, thus inhibiting abdominal metastasis.[80] Additionally, NBTXR3, a radio-enhancer NP, has been approved for pre-operative local control of locally metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.[81] NBTXR3 evokes obvious abscopal effects in anti-PD-1-sensitive and anti-PD-1-resistant lung carcinoma, thus exhibiting potential for treating patients with metastatic lung cancer, despite sensitivity (or resistance) to immunotherapies, by facilitating CD8+ T cell infiltration.[81]\n        Despite the tremendous body of existing research related to organ-specific metastasis, a large number of patients suffer from metastasis in multiple organs. Therefore, identifying triggers of metastasis that are common to different cell types, organs, and tumor types, as well as the design of relevant nanotherapeutics, should be considered.\nChallenges Facing Nano-immunotherapy in Lung Cancer Metastasis\n      Owing to the high levels of incurability with current therapeutics, novel and effective approaches are required to treat metastatic cancer. The applications of immunotherapy nanotechnology for cancer metastasis treatment may represent a promising therapeutic strategy due to the pivotal role of tumor immunology in metastasis.[11] However, attempts at further improving clinical application remain challenging.\n      First, owing to the properties of metastatic tumors, namely their small size, un-vascularized nature, high multiplicity, and dispersal in different organs, the permeability and retention effect of NPs is significantly stunted in metastatic sites than in primary solid tumors.[20] Moreover, the heterogeneity of tumors, including differences between primary and metastatic tumors, between patients, and within the same patient with different disease stages, may limit the antimetastatic capability.[82] Thus, an efficient approach for treating primary lung cancer may be ineffective for secondary tumors. These hurdles might be overcome by further modulating the TME and enhancing the immune response to block the metastatic stages, particularly, the development of CTCs and DTCs.[11]\n      For immunotherapy, most NPs and immunotherapy studies have largely been based on a background of melanomas,[83] thus limiting our understanding of their application and the availability of comprehensive data for lung cancer research. Therefore, balancing antitumor immune responses and immune escape, while minimizing possible adverse effects in lung cancer must be investigated for the broad applicability of nanomedicine-based immunotherapy in future clinical practice.\n      Regarding nanomedicine, many parameters, including encapsulation efficiency, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo toxicity, require further optimization. To date, nanomedicine-based immunotherapy primarily focuses on treating primary lung tumors[84]; however, it is critical to leverage nanotechnology for combating tumor cell dispersion at each stage. In addition, safety issues regarding the application of combinatorial therapies comprising several drugs or strategies, as well as the complications associated with particle compositions, limit the translational applicability of nanotherapeutics.\n      Moreover, early and accurate diagnosis of metastatic foci remains challenging. Emerging molecular detection may improve the current scenario by producing synthetic markers for biochemical amplification. Novel systems with new functions, such as advances in targeting metastatic foci and their earlier diagnosis via more sensitive and effective techniques, warrant further investigation.\nConclusions\n      Immunotherapy has demonstrated extremely promising therapeutic potential compared with other conventional modalities; however, it also faces challenges such as rapid in vivo clearance and off-target effects. To condition the TME relegating tumor cells to be highly responsive to immunotherapy, the application of nanomedicine in rendering immune cell participation in the metastatic process is particularly attractive owing to the well-established immunosuppressive nature of the metastatic TME.\n      The TME of the metastatic tumor is complex; thus, combinational immunotherapeutic strategies, such as combinations of ICIs and chimeric antigen receptor-based therapy or chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, are suitable approaches to tackle this issue. However, to boost synergistic effects and avoid obvious side effects, combinational therapy must be carefully designed according to the property of the NPs and TME. Thus, multifunctional materials must be further developed.\n      The application of nanomedicine to inhibit metastasis has attracted tremendous attention, though such research remains in its infancy. The biological mechanisms driving metastasis may be addressed by applying NP strategies. Strategies should also be established to blunt the pro-metastasis TME or reverse the pro-metastasis phenotype effects of tumor stroma cells.\n      In the future, simple designs and large-scale production of nanomedicine must be considered for clinical translation. These will rely on the integrative study of promising biomedical discoveries in cancer metastasis and technological innovations in nanoscience. In addition, phospholipid-based formulations with the highest translational potential, such as liposomes and micelles, should be further explored and produced on an industrial scale since excipients in the formulation have been previously approved by the United States FDA. Furthermore, novel techniques and criteria for tumor metastasis evaluation are required.\nFunding\n      This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (No. 82202989); the Regional Innovation Cooperation Project of Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No. 2021YFQ0029); the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (Nos. 2019YFS0111 and 2022YFS2019); the Postdoctoral Research Project of West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China (No. 2021HXBH045); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (awarded to LZ); the Special Funding for Postdoctoral Research Projects in Sichuan Province (awarded to LZ); and the Sichuan University Postdoctoral Interdisciplinary Innovation Fund (awarded to LZ).\nConflicts of interest\n      None.",
