    "description": "Objectives\n          Breast cancer screening guidelines could provide valuable tools for clinical decision making by reviewing the available evidence and providing recommendations. Little information is known about how many countries have issued breast cancer screening guidelines and the differences among existing guidelines. We systematically reviewed current guidelines and summarized corresponding recommendations, to provide references for good clinical practice in different countries.\nMethods\n          Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 27th, 2021 were conducted and supplemented by reviewing the guideline development organizations. The quality of screening guidelines was assessed from six domains of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation \u2161 (AGREE \u2161)\u00a0instrument by two appraisers. The basic information and recommendations of the issued guidelines were extracted and summarized.\n3\n      Results\n      A total of 7417 citations were included during the preliminary literature search process, but most were excluded after deleting duplicates and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 23 guidelines were identified for further review (Fig. 1).\n      \n        3.1\n        Guideline characteristics\n        Table 1 displays the general characteristics of 23 included guidelines that were published between 2010 and 2021 [[7], [8], [9],[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]]. The majority of guidelines (17 of 23) were drawn from developed countries or regions. Guidelines from the United States accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 39.1%. One was developed by WHO, and four in Europe (Fig. 2). 12 of 23 guidelines have been updated.Table 1Characteristics of 23 included guidelines on screening for breast cancer.Table 1Countries/RegionsPublication yearsPublication organizationsNames of guidelinesNumber of updated versionsPublication years of old versionsGlobal [16]2014WHOWHO position paper on mammography screeningNoneNoneThe United States [17]2019ACPScreening for Breast Cancer in Average-Risk Women: A Guidance Statement From the American College of Physicians12007The United States [18]2019NCCNBreast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, Version 1.201991998 2003 2006 2010 2013 2015 2016 2017 2018The United States [19]2017ACRACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae Breast Cancer Screening21998 2013The United States [20]2018ACRBreast Cancer Screening in Women at Higher-Than-Average Risk: Recommendations From the ACRNoneNoneThe United States [21]2017ACRBreast Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Women: Recommendations From the ACR Commission on Breast ImagingNoneNoneThe United States [22]2010ACR and SBIBreast Cancer Screening With Imaging: Recommendations From the Society of Breast Imaging and the ACR on the Use of Mammography, Breast MRI, Breast Ultrasound, and Other Technologies for the Detection of Clinically Occult Breast CancerNoneNoneThe United States [7]2016USPSTFScreening for Breast Cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement31996 2002 2009The United States [23]2015ACSBreast Cancer Screening for Women at Average Risk 2015 Guideline Update From the American Cancer Society31992 1997 2003The United States [24]2019ACOGBreast Cancer Risk Assessment and Screening in Average-Risk Women32003 20112017Europe [25]2020ECIBCBreast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis: A Synopsis of the European Breast GuidelinesNoneNoneEurope [8]2019ESMOEarly breast cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up12015Europe [26]2010EUSOMAMagnetic resonance imaging of the breast: Recommendations from the EUSOMA working groupNoneNoneCanada [27]2018CTFPHCRecommendations on screening for breast cancer in women aged 40\u201374 years who are not at increased risk for breast cancer31994 2001 2011Germany [28]2018AWMF, DKG,\u00a0and DKHThe Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Breast Cancer12012Australia [29]2015Cancer AustraliaEarly detection of breast cancer22009 2004Singapore [30]2010MOHCancer screeningNoneNoneMalaysia [31]2019MOHManagement of Breast Cancer (3rd Edition)22002 2010Japan [9]2016NCC JapanThe Japanese Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening22013 2015China [32]2021NCC ChinaChina\u00a0Guideline\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Screening\u00a0and Early Detection\u00a0of Female\u00a0Breast\u00a0Cancer\u00a0(2021,\u00a0Beijing)NoneNoneHong Kong, China [33]2018CEWGRecommendations on prevention and screening for breast cancer in Hong KongNoneNoneBrazil [34]2018MOHGuidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Brazil.

The average AGREE II scores varied from 33.3% to 87.5%. 12 guidelines were scored over 60.0% [[7], [8], [16], [17], [23], [24], [25], [27], [30], [31], [32], [34]]. Among these, the guideline issued by Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) [27] was scored the highest (87.5%), followed by European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) [25], American Cancer Society (ACS) [23], United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) [7], and WHO [16]. The highest domain score was \"clarity of presentation\" (domain 4), with an average score of 81.9%, followed by \"scope and purpose\" (domain 1). The domain with the lowest score was \"applicability\" (domain 5) with an average score of 21.3%, followed by \"stakeholder involvement\" (domain 2).Fig. 3Quality of the included guidelines for the six domains of the AGREE \u2161 instrument.(Abbreviations: ACOG: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; ACP: American College of Physicians; ACR: American College of Radiology; ACS: American Cancer Society; AWMF: German Association of Scientific Medical Societies; CBR: Brazilian College of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging; CEWG: Cancer Expert Working Group; CTFPHC: Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care; ECIBC: European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer; ESMO: European Society for Medical Oncology; EUSOMA: European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists; MOH: Ministry of Health; NCC: National\u2002Cancer\u2002Centre; NCCN: National Comprehensive Cancer Network; SBI: Society of Breast Imaging; USPSTF: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; WHO: World Health Organization).Fig. 3\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Strength of recommendations and quality of evidence\n        17 of 23 guidelines reported eight applied grading systems. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) was the common system that was applied in six guidelines [16,23,25,27,32,34]. Four guidelines used the self-designated grading system [8,9,18,30]. The details about the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence varied in different grading systems.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [18] and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [24] suggested starting screening at age 25 by clinical encounter or clinical breast examination (CBE).\n          Nine of 23 guidelines did not recommend an upper age limit for breast cancer screening [8,9,16,18,20,25,27,31,32]. Some guidelines, including American College of Radiology (ACR) [21], ACR and Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) [22], and ACS [23] suggested that the age to end screening should be determined based on the women's health status, for example, stopping screening for women with life expectancy lower than 5\u20137 years or 10 years. Other guidelines, like USPSTF [7], American College of Physicians (ACP) [17], and Brazilian College of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging (CBR)/Brazilian Society for Breast Disease (SBM)/Brazilian Federation of Gynecological and Obstetrical Associations (FEBRASGO) [35] did not recommend breast cancer screening for women aged over 75 years unless their life expectancy were higher than 7 years or 10 years. German Association German Cancer Society of Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF)/German Cancer Society (DKG)/German Cancer Aid (DKH) [28] and MOH of Singapore [30] recommended stopping screening at age 70.\n        \n        \n          3.4.2\n          Screening methods and intervals\n          Mammography (MAM) was recommended as the primary screening modality for average-risk women by all included guidelines [[7], [8], [9], [16], [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [34], [35]]. Most guidelines suggested annual or biennial mammographic screening [7,16,17,29,31]. Three guidelines recommended screening every 1\u20132 years [[8], [23], [32]]. Some guidelines agreed that screening intervals should be determined based on age [18,24]. ACS [23] recommended screening with MAM annually for women aged 40\u201354 years and every 1\u20132 years for women aged 55 years or older. ECIBC [25] recommended screening every 2\u20133 years for women aged 40\u201349 years and for women aged 70\u201374 years. For the priority screening groups (women aged 50\u201369 years), annual screening was not recommended, and biennial screening is better than triennial screening.\n          The recommendations of each guideline on CBE and ultrasound (US) were different in detail. NCCN [18] and ACOG [24] suggested that CBE should be given every 1\u20133 years for women aged 25\u201339 years and annually for women older than 40 years, but ACS [23] and CTFPHC [27] did not recommend CBE as a primary screening method. Among the included screening guidelines, only National Cancer Centre (NCC) of China [32] recommended screening every 1\u20132 years for women older than 45 years using US alone.\n          All guidelines did not recommend using breast self-examination (BSE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) to screen for average-risk women because of lacking evidence of benefit.\n        \n      \n      \n        3.5\n        The screening recommendations for women at higher risk\n        Risk factors of breast cancer identified in the guidelines mainly fell within five categories which could be broadly summarized as the personal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast cancer; the family history of breast cancer; the known genetic predisposition of breast cancer; the history of mantle or chest radiation therapy; and dense breasts. For women at higher risk, there was a consensus among most guidelines that annual MAM screening or annual MRI screening should be given and the starting age should be earlier than the average-risk group (Table 4; Fig. 5).Table 4The screening recommendations in high-risk\u2002women in eligible guidelines.Table 4Risk factorsGuidelinesScreening ageScreening methods and intervalsPersonal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast cancerNCCN, 2019 [18]Form the time of diagnosis but no less than 30 for MAM and no less than 25 for MRI\u25a0Breast awareness and clinical encounter: every 6\u201312 months;\u25a0MAM: annual, with consideration of tomosynthesis;\u25a0MRI: annualACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]From the time of diagnosisMRI: annualACR and SBI, 2010 [22]From the time of diagnosis\u25a0MAM: annual;\u25a0Either MRI or US: annualMOH of Singapore, 2010 [30]NRMAM: annual [Grade D]MOH of Malaysia, 2019 [31]40\u201359 years, 30\u201339 years (may be considered)MAM: annual\u226560 yearsMAM: biennialNCC China, 2021 [32]NRMAM and US: annualCEWG, 2018 [33]From 35 yearsMAM: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]From diagnosis onward\u25a0MAM: annual [category C recommendation];\u25a0MRI: annual [category C recommendation]Family history of breast cancerNCCN, 2019 [18]Begin at the age identified as being at increased riskBreast awareness and clinical encounter: every 6\u201312 monthsStart from 10 years prior to the diagnosis of youngest family member but not less than 30DM: annual, with consideration of tomosynthesisBegin 10 years prior to the diagnosis of youngest family memberMRI: annualESMO, 2019 [8]NRMAM and MRI: annual (concomitant or alternating) [\u2162, A]NCC China, 2020 [32]NRMAM and US: annualCEWG, 2018 [33]Begin at age 35 or 10 years prior to the age at diagnosis of the youngest-affected relative (for those with family history), whichever is earlier, but not earlier than age 30.MAM: annualKnown genetic predisposition of breast cancerACR, 2017 [19]NR\u25a0MAM or DBT is recommended;\u25a0MRI may be considered as an adjunct to MAM or DBT;\u25a0US is recommended when the patient cannot tolerate MRIACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]30 yearsDM+/DBT: annual25\u201330 yearsMRI: annualACR and SBI, 2010 [22]Start by age 30 but not before age 25MAM: annualEUSOMA, 2010 [26]Start from 30 years;Before 30 years [discuss, mutation carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (start from 25 to 29) and TP53 (start from 20)]MRI: annualMOH of Singapore, 2010 [30]Start at age 25\u201330 years for BRCA mutation carriers and their untested first-degree relatives, or as early as 5\u201310 years before the age of onset of breast cancer in the youngest family member in those with family history of breast cancer but no proven mutation\u25a0BSE: monthly [Grade D];\u25a0CBE: 6 monthly [Grade D];\u25a0MAM and MRI: annual [Grade D]MOH of Malaysia, 2019 [31]30\u201349 yearsMRI: annual40\u201369 yearsMAM: annual\u226570 yearsMAM: biennialNCC China, 2020 [32]NRMRI: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]From 30 yearsMAM annual [category B recommendation]From 25 yearsMRI annual [category A recommendation]History of mantle or chest radiation therapyNCCN, 2019 [18]Start from 10 years after radiation exposureBreast awareness and clinical encounter: every 6\u201312 monthsStart from 10 years after radiation exposure but not less than age 30DM: annual, with consideration of tomosynthesisStart from 10 years after radiation exposure but not less than age 25MRI: annualStart from 10 years after radiation exposure for women\u00a0younger\u00a0than\u00a025 years\u00a0who have\u00a0received\u00a0prior\u00a0thoracic\u00a0irradiationBreast awareness, counseling on risk and an annual clinical encounterACR, 2017 [19]Start from age 25 or 8 years after radiation therapy, whichever is laterMAMACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]Start from age 25 or 8 years after radiation therapy, whichever is laterDM+/DBT: annualNCC China, 2020 [32]NRMRI: annualCEWG, 2018 [33]Begin at age 35\u25a0MAM: annual;\u25a0Consider MAM\u00a0+\u00a0MRI: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]Start from the 8th year after radiotherapy onward, but not begin before age 30MAM: annual [category C recommendation]Start from the 8th year after radiotherapy onward, but not begin before age 25MRI: annual [category C recommendation]Dense breastsACR, 2017 [19]NRConsider: USACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]NR\u25a0MRI: annual;\u25a0The addition of US to MAM may be usefulACR and SBI, 2010 [22]NRConsider: US as an adjunct to MAMChina NCC, 2020 [32]NRMAM and US: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]NRConsider: US as an adjunct to MAMAbbreviations: ACR: American College of Radiology;

Especially for patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer, close monitoring of the contralateral breast was recommended. NCCN [18] also recommended breast awareness and clinical encounter every 6\u201312 months for this group of women. NCC of China [32] recommended MAM and US as screening methods for women at higher risk of breast cancer.\n        \n        \n          3.5.2\n          Women with the family history of breast cancer\n          For women with a family history suspicious of the inherited predisposition of breast cancer, two guidelines recommended that an annual MAM or annual MRI began 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the youngest-affected relative but not before the age of 30 [18,33]. NCCN [18] also recommended regular clinical visits every 6\u201312 months once the women were identified as begin at increased risk of breast cancer.\n        \n        \n          3.5.3\n          Women with the known genetic predisposition of breast cancer\n          Women with breast cancer susceptibility\u00a0gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) mutations, or untested but have first-degree relatives (mothers, sisters, or daughters) who are proven to have BRCA mutations, have a higher risk for breast cancer. Two guidelines recommended that women with gene mutations should start to undertake annual MAM or annual MRI at 25\u201330 years [22,30]. European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA) [26] recommended that annual MRI screening was performed for women carrying BRAC at 25\u201329 years, and those carrying TP53 at 20 years. MOH of Malaysia [31] provided age-specific recommendations for women carrying gene mutations, specifically, annual MRI for 30\u201349 years, annual MAM for 40\u201369 years, and biennial MAM for 70 years and above. For other recommended screening methods, ACR [19] recommended MRI as an adjunct to MAM or DBT and recommended US when the patient cannot tolerate MRI. MOH of Singapore [30] also recommended monthly BSE and 6 monthly CBE.\n        \n        \n          3.5.4\n          Women with the history of mantle or chest radiation therapy\n          For women with a history of mantle or chest radiation therapy that occurred before the age of 30 years or had a cumulative dose of 10\u00a0Gy radiation, most guidelines recommended starting regular screening 8 or 10 years after radiation therapy [[18], [19], [20],35]. Recommended screening strategies included annual MAM (not before age 30), annual MRI (not before age 25), or annual digital mammography (DM) (with or without digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)). NCCN [18] also recommended increasing breast awareness or clinical encounters every 6\u201312 months.\n        \n        \n          3.5.5\n          Women with dense breasts\n          For women with dense breasts, ACR [20] recommended MRI should be performed annually. NCC of China [32] recommended screening with MAM and US annually. US (as adjunctive screening tools) was recommended for high-risk women who may be suitable for MRI but can not be accepted for any reason [20]. Two guidelines [[22], [35]] also recommended US as an adjunctive examination to MAM in asymptomatic women with dense breasts.\n5\n      Conclusions\n      In summary, this study reviewed and compared the latest international breast screening guidelines for women both at average risk and at higher risk. The majority of guidelines were issued by developed countries, containing roughly the same but not identical recommendations for breast cancer on screening age, methods, and intervals. Most guidelines recommended annual or biennial mammographic screening for average-risk populations aged between 40 and 74 years and early annual MAM or annual MRI for high-risk populations. Current guidelines varied in methodological quality and increased efforts are needed to develop high-quality guidelines to provide more powerful supporting evidence for guidelines users. LMICs lacked published tailored clinical practice guideline. Therefore, we encourage policymakers and clinicians to use the evidence-based guidelines with higher AGREE \u2161 scores considering local adaption.\n1\n      Introduction\n      In 2021, breast cancer has overtaken lung cancer to be the world's most commonly diagnosed cancer, accounting for the severe burden globally, especially among women [1]. Screening for breast cancer is an effective measure to detect early-stage disease and improve the survival rate of cancer patients [[2], [3]]. Population-based breast cancer screening programs have been implemented in many developed countries over the last decades, which contributed to reducing the mortality and the advanced cancer rate [[4], [5], [6]].\n      Screening guidelines could provide valuable tools for clinical decision making by reviewing the available evidence and providing recommendations. To date, several breast cancer screening guidelines have been issued in many developed countries [[7], [8], [9]]. However, the recommendations about screening age, methods, and intervals varied from different guidelines due to different institutions, based evidence, and development processes. This may confuse the clinical practice when they are applied to other countries. To our knowledge, it is currently unknown how many countries have issued breast cancer screening guidelines and the differences among these issued guidelines. Additionally, previous systematic reviews of international breast cancer screening guidelines were limited by publication date and screening population and did not systematically review screening recommendations for the population with different breast cancer risks [[10], [11], [12]].\n      Accordingly, our study reviewed existing breast cancer screening guidelines and summarized corresponding recommendations, in order to provide references for good clinical practice in different countries.\n2\n      Material and methods\n      \n        2.1\n        Data sources and searches\n        A search strategy was designed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 27th, 2021 using variations on the search terms \"breast cancer\", \"screening\" and \"guidelines/recommendations\" (Appendix A). We also sought the additional guidelines by searching guideline development organizations, such as Guideline International Network (GIN), World Health Organization (WHO), Cancer Australia, Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia, and China Guideline Clearinghouse (CGC). Moreover, we meticulously examined the references of documents obtained above to further access potentially eligible articles.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Study selection and data extraction\n        The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram is presented in Fig. 1. Two reviewers (MYC and WHR) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the included guidelines. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Finally, both reviewers determined the included guidelines based on the full text. We included guidelines following inclusion criteria: (1) originally published guidelines, consensus, or position papers related to breast cancer screening; (2) the latest versions of the updated guidelines; (3) English or Chinese guidelines; and (4) full text was available. We excluded guidelines if they were: summaries or interpreted versions of guidelines.Fig. 1Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.Fig. 1\n        Two independent reviewers (MYC and WHR) extracted information using a predesigned template. The information extracted included: (1) basic information (countries or regions, publication years, publication organizations, names of guidelines, number of updated versions, and publication years of old versions); (2) screening recommendations for the population at average risk and higher risk (screening age, screening methods, screening intervals, level of evidence, and strength of recommendation).\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Quality assessment\n        The methodological\u00a0quality of guidelines was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation \u2161 (AGREE \u2161)\u00a0instrument. This is a standardized tool for evaluating the methodological framework of guideline development which consists of 23 main items in six domains (scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence) and two global rating items [13]. Each item is rated on a seven-point Likert-type scale from one (strongly disagree) to seven (strongly agree) according to the criteria and considerations articulated in the User's Manual. Scores are assigned depending on the completeness and quality of reporting. Scores increase as more criteria are met and considerations are addressed. Domain scores are calculated by summing up all the scores of the individual items in that domain and by scaling the total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain. Two reviewers (MYC and WHR) independently scored each guideline. Evaluation results were compared and discrepancies of more than two points per item were discussed to reach a consensus. According to prior studies, the quality of guidelines was classified as high if the total score was 60% or higher and low if the score was less than 60% [14,15].\n2.1\n        Data sources and searches\n        A search strategy was designed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 27th, 2021 using variations on the search terms \"breast cancer\", \"screening\" and \"guidelines/recommendations\" (Appendix A). We also sought the additional guidelines by searching guideline development organizations, such as Guideline International Network (GIN), World Health Organization (WHO), Cancer Australia, Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia, and China Guideline Clearinghouse (CGC). Moreover, we meticulously examined the references of documents obtained above to further access potentially eligible articles.\n2.2\n        Study selection and data extraction\n        The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram is presented in Fig. 1. Two reviewers (MYC and WHR) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the included guidelines. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Finally, both reviewers determined the included guidelines based on the full text. We included guidelines following inclusion criteria: (1) originally published guidelines, consensus, or position papers related to breast cancer screening; (2) the latest versions of the updated guidelines; (3) English or Chinese guidelines; and (4) full text was available. We excluded guidelines if they were: summaries or interpreted versions of guidelines.Fig. 1Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.Fig. 1\n        Two independent reviewers (MYC and WHR) extracted information using a predesigned template. The information extracted included: (1) basic information (countries or regions, publication years, publication organizations, names of guidelines, number of updated versions, and publication years of old versions); (2) screening recommendations for the population at average risk and higher risk (screening age, screening methods, screening intervals, level of evidence, and strength of recommendation).\n3.2\n        Quality assessment\n        The included 23 guidelines were appraised using AGREE II Criteria (Fig. 3). The average AGREE II scores varied from 33.3% to 87.5%. 12 guidelines were scored over 60.0% [[7], [8], [16], [17], [23], [24], [25], [27], [30], [31], [32], [34]]. Among these, the guideline issued by Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) [27] was scored the highest (87.5%), followed by European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) [25], American Cancer Society (ACS) [23], United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) [7], and WHO [16]. The highest domain score was \"clarity of presentation\" (domain 4), with an average score of 81.9%, followed by \"scope and purpose\" (domain 1). The domain with the lowest score was \"applicability\" (domain 5) with an average score of 21.3%, followed by \"stakeholder involvement\" (domain 2).Fig. 3Quality of the included guidelines for the six domains of the AGREE \u2161 instrument.(Abbreviations: ACOG: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; ACP: American College of Physicians; ACR: American College of Radiology; ACS: American Cancer Society; AWMF: German Association of Scientific Medical Societies; CBR: Brazilian College of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging; CEWG: Cancer Expert Working Group; CTFPHC: Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care; ECIBC: European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer; ESMO: European Society for Medical Oncology; EUSOMA: European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists; MOH: Ministry of Health; NCC: National\u2002Cancer\u2002Centre; NCCN: National Comprehensive Cancer Network; SBI: Society of Breast Imaging; USPSTF: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; WHO: World Health Organization).Fig. 3\n3.1\n        Guideline characteristics\n        Table 1 displays the general characteristics of 23 included guidelines that were published between 2010 and 2021 [[7], [8], [9],[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]]. The majority of guidelines (17 of 23) were drawn from developed countries or regions. Guidelines from the United States accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 39.1%. One was developed by WHO, and four in Europe (Fig. 2). 12 of 23 guidelines have been updated.Table 1Characteristics of 23 included guidelines on screening for breast cancer.Table 1Countries/RegionsPublication yearsPublication organizationsNames of guidelinesNumber of updated versionsPublication years of old versionsGlobal [16]2014WHOWHO position paper on mammography screeningNoneNoneThe United States [17]2019ACPScreening for Breast Cancer in Average-Risk Women: A Guidance Statement From the American College of Physicians12007The United States [18]2019NCCNBreast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, Version 1.201991998 2003 2006 2010 2013 2015 2016 2017 2018The United States [19]2017ACRACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae Breast Cancer Screening21998 2013The United States [20]2018ACRBreast Cancer Screening in Women at Higher-Than-Average Risk: Recommendations From the ACRNoneNoneThe United States [21]2017ACRBreast Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Women: Recommendations From the ACR Commission on Breast ImagingNoneNoneThe United States [22]2010ACR and SBIBreast Cancer Screening With Imaging: Recommendations From the Society of Breast Imaging and the ACR on the Use of Mammography, Breast MRI, Breast Ultrasound, and Other Technologies for the Detection of Clinically Occult Breast CancerNoneNoneThe United States [7]2016USPSTFScreening for Breast Cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement31996 2002 2009The United States [23]2015ACSBreast Cancer Screening for Women at Average Risk 2015 Guideline Update From the American Cancer Society31992 1997 2003The United States [24]2019ACOGBreast Cancer Risk Assessment and Screening in Average-Risk Women32003 20112017Europe [25]2020ECIBCBreast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis: A Synopsis of the European Breast GuidelinesNoneNoneEurope [8]2019ESMOEarly breast cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up12015Europe [26]2010EUSOMAMagnetic resonance imaging of the breast: Recommendations from the EUSOMA working groupNoneNoneCanada [27]2018CTFPHCRecommendations on screening for breast cancer in women aged 40\u201374 years who are not at increased risk for breast cancer31994 2001 2011Germany [28]2018AWMF, DKG,\u00a0and DKHThe Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Breast Cancer12012Australia [29]2015Cancer AustraliaEarly detection of breast cancer22009 2004Singapore [30]2010MOHCancer screeningNoneNoneMalaysia [31]2019MOHManagement of Breast Cancer (3rd Edition)22002 2010Japan [9]2016NCC JapanThe Japanese Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening22013 2015China [32]2021NCC ChinaChina\u00a0Guideline\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Screening\u00a0and Early Detection\u00a0of Female\u00a0Breast\u00a0Cancer\u00a0(2021,\u00a0Beijing)NoneNoneHong Kong, China [33]2018CEWGRecommendations on prevention and screening for breast cancer in Hong KongNoneNoneBrazil [34]2018MOHGuidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Brazil.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [18] and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [24] suggested starting screening at age 25 by clinical encounter or clinical breast examination (CBE).\n          Nine of 23 guidelines did not recommend an upper age limit for breast cancer screening [8,9,16,18,20,25,27,31,32]. Some guidelines, including American College of Radiology (ACR) [21], ACR and Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) [22], and ACS [23] suggested that the age to end screening should be determined based on the women's health status, for example, stopping screening for women with life expectancy lower than 5\u20137 years or 10 years. Other guidelines, like USPSTF [7], American College of Physicians (ACP) [17], and Brazilian College of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging (CBR)/Brazilian Society for Breast Disease (SBM)/Brazilian Federation of Gynecological and Obstetrical Associations (FEBRASGO) [35] did not recommend breast cancer screening for women aged over 75 years unless their life expectancy were higher than 7 years or 10 years. German Association German Cancer Society of Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF)/German Cancer Society (DKG)/German Cancer Aid (DKH) [28] and MOH of Singapore [30] recommended stopping screening at age 70.\n        \n        \n          3.4.2\n          Screening methods and intervals\n          Mammography (MAM) was recommended as the primary screening modality for average-risk women by all included guidelines [[7], [8], [9], [16], [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [34], [35]]. Most guidelines suggested annual or biennial mammographic screening [7,16,17,29,31]. Three guidelines recommended screening every 1\u20132 years [[8], [23], [32]]. Some guidelines agreed that screening intervals should be determined based on age [18,24]. ACS [23] recommended screening with MAM annually for women aged 40\u201354 years and every 1\u20132 years for women aged 55 years or older. ECIBC [25] recommended screening every 2\u20133 years for women aged 40\u201349 years and for women aged 70\u201374 years. For the priority screening groups (women aged 50\u201369 years), annual screening was not recommended, and biennial screening is better than triennial screening.\n          The recommendations of each guideline on CBE and ultrasound (US) were different in detail. NCCN [18] and ACOG [24] suggested that CBE should be given every 1\u20133 years for women aged 25\u201339 years and annually for women older than 40 years, but ACS [23] and CTFPHC [27] did not recommend CBE as a primary screening method. Among the included screening guidelines, only National Cancer Centre (NCC) of China [32] recommended screening every 1\u20132 years for women older than 45 years using US alone.\n          All guidelines did not recommend using breast self-examination (BSE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) to screen for average-risk women because of lacking evidence of benefit.\n3.4.1\n          Screening age\n          The majority of guidelines recommended mammographic screening for average-risk individuals aged 40\u201374 years [[7], [8], [9],16,17,29,35], and recommended women aged 50\u201369 years as the optimal age group for screening with strong recommendation [8,16,25,28,30,34]. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [18] and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [24] suggested starting screening at age 25 by clinical encounter or clinical breast examination (CBE).\n          Nine of 23 guidelines did not recommend an upper age limit for breast cancer screening [8,9,16,18,20,25,27,31,32].

Some guidelines agreed that screening intervals should be determined based on age [18,24]. ACS [23] recommended screening with MAM annually for women aged 40\u201354 years and every 1\u20132 years for women aged 55 years or older. ECIBC [25] recommended screening every 2\u20133 years for women aged 40\u201349 years and for women aged 70\u201374 years. For the priority screening groups (women aged 50\u201369 years), annual screening was not recommended, and biennial screening is better than triennial screening.\n          The recommendations of each guideline on CBE and ultrasound (US) were different in detail. NCCN [18] and ACOG [24] suggested that CBE should be given every 1\u20133 years for women aged 25\u201339 years and annually for women older than 40 years, but ACS [23] and CTFPHC [27] did not recommend CBE as a primary screening method. Among the included screening guidelines, only National Cancer Centre (NCC) of China [32] recommended screening every 1\u20132 years for women older than 45 years using US alone.\n          All guidelines did not recommend using breast self-examination (BSE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) to screen for average-risk women because of lacking evidence of benefit.\n3.5\n        The screening recommendations for women at higher risk\n        Risk factors of breast cancer identified in the guidelines mainly fell within five categories which could be broadly summarized as the personal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast cancer; the family history of breast cancer; the known genetic predisposition of breast cancer; the history of mantle or chest radiation therapy; and dense breasts. For women at higher risk, there was a consensus among most guidelines that annual MAM screening or annual MRI screening should be given and the starting age should be earlier than the average-risk group (Table 4; Fig. 5).Table 4The screening recommendations in high-risk\u2002women in eligible guidelines.Table 4Risk factorsGuidelinesScreening ageScreening methods and intervalsPersonal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast cancerNCCN, 2019 [18]Form the time of diagnosis but no less than 30 for MAM and no less than 25 for MRI\u25a0Breast awareness and clinical encounter: every 6\u201312 months;\u25a0MAM: annual, with consideration of tomosynthesis;\u25a0MRI: annualACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]From the time of diagnosisMRI: annualACR and SBI, 2010 [22]From the time of diagnosis\u25a0MAM: annual;\u25a0Either MRI or US: annualMOH of Singapore, 2010 [30]NRMAM: annual [Grade D]MOH of Malaysia, 2019 [31]40\u201359 years, 30\u201339 years (may be considered)MAM: annual\u226560 yearsMAM: biennialNCC China, 2021 [32]NRMAM and US: annualCEWG, 2018 [33]From 35 yearsMAM: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]From diagnosis onward\u25a0MAM: annual [category C recommendation];\u25a0MRI: annual [category C recommendation]Family history of breast cancerNCCN, 2019 [18]Begin at the age identified as being at increased riskBreast awareness and clinical encounter: every 6\u201312 monthsStart from 10 years prior to the diagnosis of youngest family member but not less than 30DM: annual, with consideration of tomosynthesisBegin 10 years prior to the diagnosis of youngest family memberMRI: annualESMO, 2019 [8]NRMAM and MRI: annual (concomitant or alternating) [\u2162, A]NCC China, 2020 [32]NRMAM and US: annualCEWG, 2018 [33]Begin at age 35 or 10 years prior to the age at diagnosis of the youngest-affected relative (for those with family history), whichever is earlier, but not earlier than age 30.MAM: annualKnown genetic predisposition of breast cancerACR, 2017 [19]NR\u25a0MAM or DBT is recommended;\u25a0MRI may be considered as an adjunct to MAM or DBT;\u25a0US is recommended when the patient cannot tolerate MRIACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]30 yearsDM+/DBT: annual25\u201330 yearsMRI: annualACR and SBI, 2010 [22]Start by age 30 but not before age 25MAM: annualEUSOMA, 2010 [26]Start from 30 years;Before 30 years [discuss, mutation carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (start from 25 to 29) and TP53 (start from 20)]MRI: annualMOH of Singapore, 2010 [30]Start at age 25\u201330 years for BRCA mutation carriers and their untested first-degree relatives, or as early as 5\u201310 years before the age of onset of breast cancer in the youngest family member in those with family history of breast cancer but no proven mutation\u25a0BSE: monthly [Grade D];\u25a0CBE: 6 monthly [Grade D];\u25a0MAM and MRI: annual [Grade D]MOH of Malaysia, 2019 [31]30\u201349 yearsMRI: annual40\u201369 yearsMAM: annual\u226570 yearsMAM: biennialNCC China, 2020 [32]NRMRI: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]From 30 yearsMAM annual [category B recommendation]From 25 yearsMRI annual [category A recommendation]History of mantle or chest radiation therapyNCCN, 2019 [18]Start from 10 years after radiation exposureBreast awareness and clinical encounter: every 6\u201312 monthsStart from 10 years after radiation exposure but not less than age 30DM: annual, with consideration of tomosynthesisStart from 10 years after radiation exposure but not less than age 25MRI: annualStart from 10 years after radiation exposure for women\u00a0younger\u00a0than\u00a025 years\u00a0who have\u00a0received\u00a0prior\u00a0thoracic\u00a0irradiationBreast awareness, counseling on risk and an annual clinical encounterACR, 2017 [19]Start from age 25 or 8 years after radiation therapy, whichever is laterMAMACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]Start from age 25 or 8 years after radiation therapy, whichever is laterDM+/DBT: annualNCC China, 2020 [32]NRMRI: annualCEWG, 2018 [33]Begin at age 35\u25a0MAM: annual;\u25a0Consider MAM\u00a0+\u00a0MRI: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]Start from the 8th year after radiotherapy onward, but not begin before age 30MAM: annual [category C recommendation]Start from the 8th year after radiotherapy onward, but not begin before age 25MRI: annual [category C recommendation]Dense breastsACR, 2017 [19]NRConsider: USACR (High-risk), 2017 [20]NR\u25a0MRI: annual;\u25a0The addition of US to MAM may be usefulACR and SBI, 2010 [22]NRConsider: US as an adjunct to MAMChina NCC, 2020 [32]NRMAM and US: annualCBR, SBM, and FEBRASGO, 2017 [35]NRConsider: US as an adjunct to MAMAbbreviations: ACR: American College of Radiology;

Especially for patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer, close monitoring of the contralateral breast was recommended. NCCN [18] also recommended breast awareness and clinical encounter every 6\u201312 months for this group of women.

NCCN [18] also recommended regular clinical visits every 6\u201312 months once the women were identified as begin at increased risk of breast cancer.\n        \n        \n          3.5.3\n          Women with the known genetic predisposition of breast cancer\n          Women with breast cancer susceptibility\u00a0gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) mutations, or untested but have first-degree relatives (mothers, sisters, or daughters) who are proven to have BRCA mutations, have a higher risk for breast cancer. Two guidelines recommended that women with gene mutations should start to undertake annual MAM or annual MRI at 25\u201330 years [22,30]. European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA) [26] recommended that annual MRI screening was performed for women carrying BRAC at 25\u201329 years, and those carrying TP53 at 20 years. MOH of Malaysia [31] provided age-specific recommendations for women carrying gene mutations, specifically, annual MRI for 30\u201349 years, annual MAM for 40\u201369 years, and biennial MAM for 70 years and above. For other recommended screening methods, ACR [19] recommended MRI as an adjunct to MAM or DBT and recommended US when the patient cannot tolerate MRI.

Recommended screening strategies included annual MAM (not before age 30), annual MRI (not before age 25), or annual digital mammography (DM) (with or without digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)).

Two guidelines [[22], [35]] also recommended US as an adjunctive examination to MAM in asymptomatic women with dense breasts.\n3.5.1\n          Women with the personal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast cancer\n          For women with biopsy-proven Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS), Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH), Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), or invasive breast cancer or ovarian cancer, annual MAM or annual MRI was mainly recommended after diagnosis onward [18,20,22,31,33,35].

A total of 23 guidelines issued between 2010 and 2021 in 11 countries or regions were included in this study. The content and quality varied between the guidelines. The average AGREE \u2161 scores ranged from 33.3% to 87.5%, which is consistent with that reported by Li J et al. [12]. We found discrepancies between guidelines concerning screening age, methods, and intervals. In general, the majority of guidelines agreed upon annual or biennial MAM for average-risk women aged 40 to 74. Annual MAM or annual MRI should be given and start earlier for women at high risk for breast cancer.\n      Our study showed that many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lacked published clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer screening. Most included guidelines in our study were issued by developed countries, mainly in the United States (9/23) and Europe (4/23). One possible explanation is that high-income countries have accumulated more high-quality evidence for developing guidelines by implementing breast cancer screening programs and related research for a long time [[4], [5], [6]]. However, although LMICs have a severe breast cancer burden, few tailored guidelines have been issued due to lacking sufficient national evidence about breast cancer screening and the front-line impact of sparse resources to develop guidelines in these areas [36,37]. Additionally, some LMICs guidelines might be published in local languages and were not picked up in our search. We also found that some guidelines issued by LMICs are often based on evidence from high-income countries. The extent to which these guidelines can be applied to the clinical practice of routine screening in LMICs is unknown.\n      High-quality guidelines are vital to facilitate clinical decision making and to improve health outcomes and health service efficiency. Our findings showed nearly half of the included guidelines were rated as high quality. Most of the guidelines provided a clear description of \"scope and purpose\" as screening for populations with different breast cancer risks, and screening recommendations were described clearly. For these reasons, the domains \"scope and purpose\" and \"clarity of presentation\" received high scores. In contrast, the majority of the guidelines received low scores in the domains of \"rigour of development\" and \"applicability\". According to prior studies [[38], [39]], the domain \"rigour of development\" was the most relevant to the overall quality of the guideline. The main reason was that this domain reflects the evidence collection and synthesis process, as well as the formation and follow-up update of recommendations, which can provide enough information to evaluate whether the guidelines followed the best methodology and developed evidence-based recommendations. Meanwhile, the development process of guidelines is also one of the key reasons causing the variations between the recommendations from different guidance documents. In our study, 17 of 23 guidelines reported using eight different grading systems to evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, which somewhat impeded the implementation of the guidelines and caused confusion in clinical practice. The most important purpose of guidelines is to promote their application to real-world medicine practice. Therefore, guideline developers should clearly describe the promotion conditions and hindrance factors in the implementation of recommendations and their improvement strategies, as well as consider the likely resource implications involved. At the same time, the quality of the \"applicability\" domain also plays a critical role in whether they can be extended to LMICs that might lack indigenous guidelines. Our study showed that the scores of different guidelines varied greatly in the domain \"applicability\". For example, the guideline issued by MOH of Malaysia [31] contained a separate section called \"implementing the guidelines\", which described the types of facilitators and barriers in detail, as well as put forward suggestions to ensure the implementation of the guideline. In contrast, the \"ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae Breast Cancer Screening\" [19] did not mention facilitators and barriers to its application. Based on the above considerations, we considered the guideline developed by MOH of Malaysia with high \"applicability\" rather than ACR.\n      The majority of guidelines recommended mammographic screening for average-risk women aged 40\u201374 years. 50\u201369 years were regarded as the optimal age group for screening due to the steep increase of breast cancer beginning around age 50. In 2019, almost 82% of breast cancer was diagnosed among women aged \u2265 50 years in the United States [40]. Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from developed countries also showed that mammographic screening between 50 and 69 years had the greatest benefit in reducing mortality [[41], [42]]. However, due to the disease burden of breast cancer and the allocation of public health resources vary in different countries, a one-size-fits-all approach to screening is considered inapplicable. In several Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea, the peak age of breast cancer incidence in women mainly ranges from 45 to 69 years old which is more than 10 years earlier than that in Europe and the United States [43,44]. Although some Asian guidelines agreed on beginning screening from the age of 40 or 45 years [9,30,32], high-quality evidence from large population-based RCTs is insufficient. In addition, based on several RCTs conducted in Canada, the UK, and Sweden, ECIBC and CTFPHC did not recommend regular screening begin at 40\u201344 years since the lower absolute benefit and higher overdiagnosis and false positives rate with related biopsies of this age group [2,25,27,[45], [46], [47]]. Furthermore, nine of 23 guidelines did not recommend an upper age limit. However, some guidelines recommended against regular screening for women older than age 70 or 75 years, as the harm potentially exceeds the benefits if screening is continued after these age groups [48]. The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Consequently, the decision to stop screening should be individually based on life expectancy or comorbid conditions.\n      Currently, MAM is widely accepted in developed countries with sufficient evidence to decrease breast cancer mortality among women aged 50\u201374 years and is recommended as a primary screening method in most screening guidelines [49]. Due to relatively high cost and the demand for high-quality radiologists, the application of MAM in low resource areas is limited [50]. Additionally, because higher mammographic density is associated with the masking of breast cancer on a mammogram, the sensitivity of MAM for women with dense breasts is lower than that for women with mainly fatty breasts [51]. Mammographic density among Asian women is higher than among Western women [52]. Several Asian studies have shown that US can improve the detection rate of breast cancer for women with dense breasts [53,54]. However, there is limited evidence for US in breast cancer screening to reduce mortality. Accordingly, the guidelines from European and American countries did not recommend US as the primary technique for breast cancer screening in average-risk population, but mainly as a supplemental method to MAM. Among the included guidelines of the present study, only Chinese guidelines recommended US as the primary screening tool. China has carried out a national breast cancer screening program since 2009. The screening tool of the program was changed from CBE to US in 2012, which provided preliminary evidence for the application of US in breast cancer screening in other Asian countries [55,56].\n      With greater emphasis on more accurate risk management based on patients and more personalized recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, age-oriented screening suggestions have been shifted to risk-based screening recommendations. By accurately identifying women who are above-average risk in the general population, we can provide timely and effective early diagnosis measures. High-risk women identified in the guidelines fell within many categories. The related recommendations for every category of high-risk women were different, which brought some difficulties to the implementation of breast cancer screening for high-risk women in the low resource areas. Thereby, identifying the risk factors of breast cancer by establishing a risk assessment model may be an effective way to prevent breast cancer. Currently, various risk prediction models were developed, such as the Gail model and BOADICEA model, whose application values in different countries are still under evaluation [57,58]. It is reported that China applies risk models as supplementary tools for screening in urban areas [59].\n      Few guidelines provided explicit recommendations for the management of women with positive findings except for NCCN [18] and NCC China [32]. Improper management of abnormal screening results may compromise the effectiveness of breast cancer screening programs. Doubeni et al. performed the PROSPR multi-model microsimulation study, which showed that the relative risk for the late-stage disease was higher when the time for diagnostic testing was delayed after an abnormal mammogram [60]. A previous study observed that low-income women and women of ethnic minority (African-American and Asian women) were less likely to have adequate follow-up abnormal breast cancer screening mammograms [61]. For these reasons, it is necessary to explore different referral and recall standards according to different initial screening results, to make a balance between the anxiety caused by false-positive breast cancer and the benefit of follow-up.\n      The strengths of this systematic review include its originality and the most comprehensive search strategy. This study was the largest and comprehensive systematic review to map the recommendations of the latest international breast screening guidelines. Furthermore, we systemically summarized the screening recommendations for both average-risk women and high-risk women.\n      Our study has some limitations. Even though we performed a comprehensive systematic search, we could not find all relevant guidelines. And we also did not include the breast screening program protocols in some countries. Another limitation was that non-English guidelines were not included in this review due to translation restrictions.\nFunding source\n      This work was supported by 10.13039/100008700International
