    "description": "Electronic supplementary material\n      \n        Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 4808\u00a0kb)\nIntroduction\n      Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to reside in both the necrotic and perivascular regions of the tumour, where glioblastoma (GBM) cells adopt a more stem cell-like phenotype [3, 9, 11]. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing studies have identified four GBM cellular states (MES-like, NPC-like, OPC-like and AC-like) that exist in varying degrees within single tumours [46]. This seminal study highlights the diversity and heterogeneity present within these aggressive tumours and provides a framework for better understanding the genetic diversity, plasticity and influence of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in GBM.\n      Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and basement membrane (BM) formation are key structural components required to support the TME in GBM [25]. The dystrophin\u2013glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a large transmembrane oligomeric complex of sarcolemmal proteins and glycoproteins. A central component of the DGC is the dystroglycan (DG) receptor. DG is an ECM binding receptor best known for its function in bridging the ECM and the cytoskeleton in skeletal myocytes [30]. The DG receptor comprises two non-covalently linked \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. \u03b1DG, the extracellular component, is highly glycosylated. Laminin binds a glycan (carbohydrate) structure attached to \u03b1DG and this interaction is critical in regulating ECM attachment. \u03b2DG, the membrane spanning component, primarily regulates dystrophin attachment to F-actin cables within the cell [18, 19, 32]. Dysregulation of \u03b1DG glycosylation or DG loss leads to various forms of muscular dystrophy, the most well-known being Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [17, 20]. DG has also been shown to be critical for brain development with receptor dysregulation leading to a number of structural and functional brain defects [43, 44]. In comparison to skeletal muscle function, less is known about the role of the DGC in adult brain. DG has been linked to blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) function and is present on the perivascular end feet of astrocytes, where it mediates cell adhesion to vascular ECM proteins [29, 41, 47, 48]. DG also has an established role in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation and function [2, 12, 22, 35]. More recently, Colognato and colleagues revealed that DG is present in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and regulates neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation via suppression of Notch signalling in the postnatal brain [39].\n      Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and integrin family receptors have been well described as having functional roles in GSC niche formation and maintenance. Eph receptors were first described during development and have been shown to be functionally over expressed in a wide variety of human cancers [7, 31, 51]. Our previous work and the findings of others have shown that a particular family member, EphA3, is significantly elevated in MES-like GBM, is most highly expressed on GSCs, particularly in perivascular regions, and is significantly elevated in recurrent disease [13, 24, 54]. Moreover, EphA3 has been shown to be over expressed and functional on mesenchymal stromal cells in the TME of human cancers [58]. Recently, we have shown that EphA3 can be effectively targeted in GBM animal models using pay-loaded antibody therapeutic strategies [50]. Integrin receptors, particularly integrin \u03b16 is also expressed on GSCs in the perivascular niche and functions to promote tumourigenesis [11, 34].\n      The role of \u03b1DG in GSC commitment and its contribution to GBM cellular states is yet to be elucidated. Here, we identify a central role of the \u03b1DG receptor in promoting a GBM MES-like state and maintenance of GSCs in the vascular niche via tight regulation of ERK signalling. Our findings indicate that \u03b1DG is functionally glycosylated and cooperates with EphA3 and integrin \u03b16 receptors to mediate an MES-like state and further acts to anchor GSCs residing in perivascular tumour regions.\nMaterials and methods\n      \n        Experimental model and subject details\n        \n          Human samples\n          Human brain cancer specimens were collected from the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital (RBWH) under Human Ethics approved project HREC/17/QRBW/577: Novel Therapies for Brain Cancer.

Survival plots were generated using Graphpad software. A Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to determine significance between experimental groups.

The correlation coefficient was determined using a Spearman rank.\nResults\n      \n        Elevated dystroglycan correlates with glioma patient outcome and \u03b1DG is abundantly glycosylated in GBM\n        \u03b1DG and \u03b2DG are transcribed from the Dystrophin-Associated Glycoprotein 1 (DAG1) gene. DG is translated as a single pre-pro-polypeptide. The receptor is autocatalytically cleaved into alpha and beta chains that remain non-covalently bound. The mucin-like domain of \u03b1DG becomes heavily glycosylated en-route to the surface membrane. Dystroglycan binds proteins of the extracellular matrix such as laminin by virtue of matriglycan (xylose and glucuronic acid polysaccharide). Receptor glycosylation is essential for proper function, without which \u03b1DG is unable to bind laminin [19, 42]. To determine if DAG1 was important in the context of brain cancer we interrogated both the Rembrandt and TCGA databases to correlate DAG1 gene expression with survival. In the context of GBM specifically and also glioma, patient tumours with elevated DAG1 led to a significantly shorter survival time (Fig.\u00a01a and Online Resource 1a). The Rembrandt database was also used to assess DAG1 gene expression in GBM as well as other forms of malignant brain cancer versus normal brain tissue. This revealed that DAG1 tended to correlate with tumour grade, as expression was highest in GBM compared to oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma cases, while all tumour types were elevated above normal brain tissue (Online Resource 1b). DAG1 expression in GBM was further stratified into molecular subtype [8, 59, 60]. DAG1 expression was highest in classical (CL) subtype GBM while approximately equivalent in other subtypes, mesenchymal (MES), proneural (PN) (Online Resource 1c). To assess the relative mRNA levels of DAG1 in GBM we performed QPCR on 28 GBM tumour specimens from our in-house tumour bank. We compared expression to other receptors (EPHA2, EPHA3 and ITGA6) previously identified as having a role in GSC maintenance. DAG1 levels were equivalent or higher to these receptors in all cases assessed (Fig.\u00a01b).Fig. 1Elevated Dystroglycan Correlates with GBM Patient Outcome and \u03b1DG is Abundantly Glycosylated in GBM. aDAG1 expression was correlated with GBM patient survival using the Rembrandt (n\u2009=\u2009523) and TCGA (n\u2009=\u2009453) databases. b QPCR analysis of DAG1, ITGA6, EPHA2 and EPHA3 mRNA expression in GBM tissue specimens (n\u2009=\u200928). c Flow cytometric analysis for \u03b1DG glycosylation (IIH6 mAb) was performed on primary GBM cell lines grown as serum-free GNS cultures, compared to isotype control.

GBM subtypes: MES mesenchymal, PN proneural, CL classical\n        Importantly, receptor function correlates closely with glycosylation status rather than gene expression. To determine the level of \u03b1DG glycosylation we used a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IIH6), previously developed by Campbell and colleagues, specific to glycan moieties on \u03b1DG with known receptor blocking function [20]. We have developed a GBM patient-derived cell line resource (Q-Cell) [14, 57] in which GBM lines are maintained as glioma neural stem cell (GNS) cultures [52]. This approach promotes a more de-differentiated stem cell-like phenotype in culture. We assessed a panel (n\u2009=\u200920) of subtype classified (n\u2009=\u200912) and unclassified (n\u2009=\u20098) early passage GBM cultures generated in-house. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the majority of the lines expressed high levels of glycosylated \u03b1DG irrespective of GBM molecular subtype (Fig.\u00a01c and Online Resource 1d). A panel of four IDH1 WT GBM lines were selected for further analysis, JK2-(MES), RN1-(MES), SJH1-(PN) and WK1-(CL), \u03b1DG protein expression was confirmed by western blot (WB) (Fig.\u00a01d). We next performed cell fractionation studies followed by WB on the panel of GBM lines, data indicated the majority of the protein was present in the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a01e).\n        A previous report in breast cancer had shown that EphA3 could regulate \u03b1DG [63]. Given these findings we assessed the co-expression of glycosylated \u03b1DG and EphA3 protein levels by flow cytometry. Mean channel fluorescence (mcf) analysis revealed a high correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.899) between glycosylated \u03b1DG and EphA3 in the primary GBM GNS lines tested (n\u2009=\u200910) (Fig.\u00a01f).\n      \n      \n        Glycosylated \u03b1DG is expressed in the vascular niche and discretely on mesenchymal-like glioma tissue\n        To examine the spatial localisation and tumour specificity of glycosylated \u03b1DG (hereafter stated as \u03b1DG for simplicity), we first examined a variant of GBM, gliosarcoma (GS), which undergoes a partial process of de-differentiation with secondary loss of the glial differentiation marker GFAP and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics, a process similar to epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) [45]. GS is characterised histologically by a biphasic pattern of gliomatous glial-like (GFAP+) and sarcomatous mesenchymal-like (MES-like) (vimentin+) tumour elements (morphology shown in Fig.\u00a02a) [27, 45]. Common genetic alterations are found between GBM and GS, and both have a poor prognosis. A known clinical feature of GS is that the mesenchymal tumour compartment is highly migratory and infiltrates ECM protein-rich brain regions such as the leptomeninges [6]. As previously shown by others, the mesenchymal elements stain positive for vimentin [27]. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vimentin, and found a clear separation between glial-rich and predominantly mesenchymal-rich regions (Fig.\u00a02b). We next performed IHC on sequential GS tumour tissue sections to determine the localisation of \u03b1DG, \u03b2DG, EphA2 and EphA3. A representative example shows that \u03b1DG and EphA3 are expressed predominantly in regions, where mesenchymal tumour elements are present and expression is low or absent on the more differentiated GFAP+ glial tumour element (Fig.\u00a02c). This discrete pattern was not evident for EphA2 and \u03b2DG which showed comparable expression in both glial and mesenchymal tumour elements. The observed biphasic tumour tissue pattern in GS also appeared, although less dramatically discrete, in GBM specimens (Online Resource 2a). These regions were smaller and less prominent than in GS tumours, and also showed heterogeneous expression of GFAP, vimentin, EphA2, EphA3 \u03b1DG, CD49f and CD31, indicating that this tumour tissue patterning might also occur in GBM (Online Resource 2b). In addition, immunofluorescent (IF) staining revealed in GBM patient specimens (n\u2009=\u20093) that \u03b1DG staining was strongest in perivascular regions immediately surrounding tumour blood vessels (CD31+) (Fig.\u00a02d and Online Resource 2c).Fig. 2Glycosylated \u03b1DG is expressed in the vascular niche and discretely on Mesenchymal-like glioma tissue. a H&E section of a Gliosarcoma (GS) patient specimen showing characteristic biphasic gliomatous (glial-like) and sarcomatous (mesenchymal-like) tumour elements. b IHC analysis of a GS specimen to identify the mesenchymal-like, vimentin+, tumour element. c IHC analysis of sequential (#1\u20136) GS tissue sections was performed to assess expression patterns of EphA2, EphA3, \u03b1DG, \u03b2DG, CD31 and GFAP. d IF dual staining of a GBM specimen showing localisation of \u03b1DG expression (IIH6\u2014green) surrounding (CD31+\u2014red) tumour blood vessels, nuclei DAPI\u2014blue). See also Online Resource 2 for additional IHC and IF analysis in GBM tissue specimens\n      \n      \n        \u03b1DG interacts with EphA2 and EphA3 receptors and is expressed on GSCs\n        Given the overlapping expression profile of EphA3 and \u03b1DG in GS and GBM tissue we wanted to assess the membrane localisation and potential interaction between these receptors. IF analysis showed a significant overlap in the membrane of EphA2, EphA3 and \u03b1DG in the four primary GBM cell lines tested (Fig.\u00a03a). To assess if these proteins could be complexed together we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of EphA3 in these lines. Results show co-immunoprecipitation of EphA3 with EphA2 and \u03b1DG (Fig.\u00a03b). To further confirm an association between these receptors we performed shRNA mediated EphA3 knockdown (KD) in SJH1 and JK2 cell lines. Following EphA3 KD a commensurate drop in \u03b1DG levels was observed (Online Resource 3a). These data suggest that \u03b1DG and EphA3 are likely associated in the cell membrane.Fig. 3\u03b1DG Interacts with EphA2 and EphA3 Receptors and is Expressed on GSCs. a IF staining was performed to compare membrane localisation of glycosylated \u03b1DG (IIH6 mAb\u2014red), compared to either EphA2 (1F7 mAb\u2014green) or EphA3 (IIIA4 mAb\u2014green), in four primary GBM cultures. b Immunoprecipitation (IP) for EphA3 was performed from 1\u00a0mg of lysate from four early passage primary GBM cultures to compare membrane association of EphA2, EphA3 and glycosylated \u03b1DG. Protein G only was used as a control. c Amnis flow cytometric analysis was performed on a dissociated GBM patient tissue specimen (n\u2009=\u20091) to assess membrane localisation of glycosylated \u03b1DG, with known GSC markers (CD15, CD133, CD49f, EphA2 and EphA3). d Amnis analysis and flow cytometry was performed on primary GBM cultures to assess membrane localisation of glycosylated \u03b1DG, with known GSC markers. e \u03b1DGhigh versus \u03b1DGlow populations were isolated from WK1 cells using FACS and cell morphology and sphere number assessed 7\u00a0days post-sort (*p\u2009<\u20090.05). GBM neuropshere differentiation was induced using 2% FBS, 3\u00a0days post-differentiation glycosylated \u03b1DG expression was assessed by flow cytometry and GSC and diff marker expression assessed by QPCR and compared to undifferentiated cells, see Online Resource 3 for complete analysis. All data presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments\n        We next used Amnis image stream technology, a flow cytometric approach which captures single-cell multi-colour fluorescent images. This approach was used to assess cell-surface co-expression of \u03b1DG with known GSC markers. Initially, this was performed on dissociated GBM patient tumour tissue (n\u2009=\u20091) obtained directly at time of surgery. Results show strong overlapping expression of \u03b1DG with EphA2, EphA3, CD49f (integrin \u03b16), CD133 and CD15 (Fig.\u00a03c). We repeated this analysis using both Amnis and standard flow cytometry using the panel of GBM cell lines (n\u2009=\u20094). Results demonstrated a similar pattern of co-expression of \u03b1DG especially with EphA2, EphA3 and CD49f, this was less pronounced for CD15, CD29 and CD133 (Fig.\u00a03d and Online Resource 3b,c). To assess stemness characteristics in the \u03b1DG high versus low expressing population we sorted WK1 GBM cells using FACS and performed a neurosphere assay. Results show that neurosphere formation was significantly elevated in the \u03b1DGhigh compared to the \u03b1DGlow population. In addition, we observed cell changes in the \u03b1DGlow population; low expressing cells that failed to form neurospheres displayed an attached differentiated cell morphology (Fig.\u00a03e). Post \u03b1DGhigh versus \u03b1DGlow sort we recombined the two cell populations and assessed \u03b1DG expression overtime. Interestingly, 14\u00a0days post-sort both low and high expressing populations were maintained, suggesting that these two unique populations can co-exist in culture for extended periods (Online Resource 3d). \u03b1DG expression and stemness characteristics should be lost following GSC differentiation. To test this we induced differentiation in our neurosphere cultures and 72\u00a0h post-differentiation assessed \u03b1DG expression by flow cytometry and GSC marker expression by QPCR. Results show a marked reduction in \u03b1DG protein expression following differentiation (Fig.\u00a03f), this was accompanied by significant gene downregulation of stemness markers and upregulation of the differentiation markers GFAP, \u03b2III-tubulin (TUBB3) and OLIG2 (Fig.\u00a03g and Online Resource 3e).\n      \n      \n        \u03b1DG blockade induces GSC differentiation\n        To assess the contribution of \u03b1DG glycosylation to the progression of GBM and maintenance of a GSC phenotype, we employed an \u03b1DG mAb (IIH6) which specifically binds and blocks the ability of glycan moieties on \u03b1DG to bind laminin [20]. Following incubation of neurospheres with the IIH6 antibody, we observed a robust and rapid loss of sphere formation compared to cultures incubated with an isotype control mAb in which sphere integrity was maintained. The response was reliably observed in all primary cultures tested (Fig.\u00a04a). The observed differentiation response was dose dependent, while no response was observed with three independent IgM control antibodies (Online Resource 4a). Neurosphere loss is suggestive of differentiation and loss of proliferative ability. Differentiation was confirmed by acquisition of neuronal (\u03b2III-tubulin) and glial (GFAP) lineage markers (Fig.\u00a04b and Online Resource 4b). This differentiation response was quantitated using IncuCyte technology in real time and showed pronounced cell-attachment following IIH6 treatment (Fig.\u00a04c). The observed differentiation response was accompanied with a significant reduction in proliferation (p\u2009<\u20090.01) (Fig.\u00a04d). We observed negligible cell death induction in the short term (48\u00a0h) following antibody treatment (Fig.\u00a04e and Online Resource 4c). Interestingly, the differentiation effects were reversible if antibody was removed within seven days of treatment. If additional IIH6 mAb was added at seven days, the majority of rechallenged tumour cells showed pronounced cell morphology changes and ultimately underwent cell death within two weeks (Fig.\u00a04f). These data highlight the ability of GBM cells to recover during early differentiation but also susceptibility to prolonged terminal differentiation induced by the IIH6 antibody.Fig. 4\u03b1DG Blockade Induces GSC Differentiation. a Four primary GBM neurosphere cultures treated with the \u03b1DG blocking mAb (IIH6, 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) and an equivalent IgM control (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml). Bright field images 24\u00a0h post-treatment showing loss of neurosphere formation and cell adherence. b IF staining was performed 48\u00a0h post IIH6 mAb treatment for the differentiation markers (GFAP-red, \u03b2III-tubulin\u2014green, myelin basic protein (MBP)\u2014red and the nuclear counter-stain DAPI-blue). WK1 data shown see also Online Resource 4b for complete analysis. c IncuCyte analysis was performed to quantitate cell adhesion in real time following IIH6 treatment-blue compared to an equivalent IgM control-red for 7\u00a0days (*p\u2009<\u20090.05). d Cell proliferation was assessed by direct cell counting using a haemocytometer 7\u00a0days post IIH6 treatment compared to IgM control and untreated cells (*p\u2009<\u20090.01). e ApoTox-Glo Triplex assay was used to assess caspase3/7 activity and cell viability 48\u00a0h post IIH6 treatment. WK1 data shown see also Online Resource 4c for complete analysis. f Neurosphere formation was assessed in WK1 cells following IIH6 withdrawal or re-addition following 7\u00a0days initial treatment. Bright field images at 2\u00a0weeks showing neurosphere re-formation following IIH6 withdrawal and cell death following IIH6 rechallenge. Data presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of three independent experiments\n      \n      \n        \u03b1DG controls ERK signalling to regulate GSCs and promote an MES-like GBM state\n        Sustained ERK activation, as distinct from transient signalling, induces translocation of ERKs to the nucleus resulting in pro-differentiation transcriptional changes in neuronal cells [38]. Based upon our previous work and also the studies of others, it appears this mechanism is also observed in a number of cancers including GBM [13, 16]. We, therefore, assessed ERK activation following IIH6 treatment and found that pERK activation was sustained 24\u00a0h post-treatment (Fig.\u00a05a). Analysis of pERK cellular localisation, following IIH6 treatment, showed that activated ERK was predominantly localised the nucleus. The observed response was equivalent to a positive differentiation control (2% FBS), while in control-treated cells, the majority of pERK was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a05b). To examine if this same mechanism was operative in patient tissue and not an artefact of culture we assessed sequential (#1\u20134) GS tumour sections by IHC for \u03b1DG, EphA3, GFAP, pERK and Ki67. Results confirmed co-expression of \u03b1DG and EphA3 in the mesenchymal fraction which was discrete from the more differentiated GFAP+ glial fraction. pERK IHC staining revealed clear co-expression with the GFAP+ glial-predominant tumour regions which also showed less proliferation as shown by very low level Ki67 staining (Fig.\u00a05c). This data confirmed that sustained ERK activation occurs in high-grade glioma tissue and is restricted to the more differentiated, GFAP+, less mitotically active tumour regions.Fig. 5\u03b1DG Controls ERK Signalling to Regulate GSCs and Promote an MES-like GBM State. a ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) was assessed by western blot in WK1 GBM neurospheres following IIH6 (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) treatment for 24\u00a0h, compared an equivalent IgM control mAb (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) and untreated cells. \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. b IF staining was performed 24\u00a0h post IIH6 mAb treatment for pERK1/2\u2014green and \u03b1DG\u2014red to assess nuclear versus cytoplasmic localisation, 2% FBS was used as positive differentiation control. c IHC analysis of sequential (#1\u20134) GS tissue sections was performed to assess discrete expression patterns of \u03b1DG, EphA3, GFAP, pERK and Ki67 (non-sequential). d QPCR analysis of integrin \u03b16A, integrin \u03b16B, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Slug mRNA expression in GBM specimens (n\u2009=\u200928). e Correlation coefficient analysis of mRNA expression of the mesenchymal markers (Slug, Snail, Twist, Vimentin and N-cadherin) and the GSC markers (EphA3, CD15, CD133, CD49f and SOX2) in 6 primary early passage GBM GNS cultures. f QPCR analysis of VEGF-A, BMI-1 and ESRP1 mRNA expression in GBM specimens (n\u2009=\u200928). g ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) was assessed by western blot in WK1 GBM neurospheres following GoH3 (10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) or IIH6 (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) either alone or in combination compared an equivalent control mAb combination IgG2a (10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml)/IgM(50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml), \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. h Cell proliferation was assessed by direct cell counts using a haemocytometer 7\u00a0days post IIH6 treatment alone or combined with GoH3. Data presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments, *p\u2009<\u20090.05\n        A study in breast cancer found that tumour cell populations differ in expression of integrin \u03b16 cytoplasmic domain splice variants; \u03b16A is expressed on epithelial tumour cells while \u03b16B on mesenchymal tumour cells [26]. Data show that \u03b16B is the critical variant driving EMT and cancer stem cell function and promotes tumour initiation. Laminin-integrin interactions can activate ERK but only in cells expressing predominantly \u03b16A with an intact cytoplasmic tail, not \u03b16B [61]. While DG when bound to laminin, can suppress integrin a6-mediated ERK activation [23]. Integrin \u03b16 has previously been demonstrated to be expressed and functional in the GSC niche and is typically active in the process of niche formation and basement membrane attachment [11, 34]. We assessed \u03b16A and \u03b16B mRNA expression via QPCR in 28 GBM specimens. Results show that \u03b16B and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Slug are predominantly expressed, while \u03b16A and the epithelial marker E-cadherin are essentially absent (Fig.\u00a05d). We also investigated the relative mRNA levels of \u03b16A and \u03b16B in 6 primary GBM GNS cell lines and found an average 12.1 fold increase in \u03b16B compared to \u03b16A. This correlated with an average 210 fold increase in the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin compared to the E-cadherin (Online Resource 5a). In addition, \u03b16B correlated highly with mesenchymal and GSC markers in the primary GNS lines tested (n\u2009=\u20096) (Fig.\u00a05e). The oncogene BMI-1 is a stem cell factor and polycomb group family member that functions as a repressor of the splicing factor ESRP-1. Mercurio and colleagues show, in breast cancer, that \u03b16B is positively controlled by autocrine VEGF-A signalling that culminates in transcriptional repression of the RNA-splicing factor ESRP-1 [26]. We, therefore, assessed BMI-1, VEGF-A and ESRP-1 mRNA levels by QPCR in GNS cell lines (n\u2009=\u20096) (data not shown) and GBM tissue (n\u2009=\u200928), this revealed high levels of BMI-1 and VEGF-A, while ESRP-1 levels were undetected (Fig.\u00a05f). This suggests that a similar mechanism to that observed in breast cancer could be operative in GBM. To determine if integrin \u03b16 was responsible for driving sustained ERK activation following IIH6 treatment we performed an integrin \u03b16 shRNA mediated KD compared to control shRNA. These cells were then treated with the IIH6 blocking mAb, KD of integrin \u03b16 did not reverse the differentiation response. A similar response was observed when cells were pre-treated with the integrin \u03b16 blocking mAb GoH3 (Online Resource 5b, c). The GoH3 blocking antibody had little effect when used as a single agent on multiple GNS cell lines and did not appear to induce a differentiation response (data not shown). GoH3 treatment alone appeared to induce very low level ERK activation (Fig.\u00a05g). This was expected given the majority of integrin \u03b16 present is the \u03b16B splice variant with a truncated intracellular tail with reduced ERK signalling capacity. When IIH6 was combined with GoH3 we observed a somewhat more rapid differentiation response, this coincided with an increased level of sustained ERK activation than IIH6 alone 24\u00a0h post-treatment (Fig.\u00a05g), and a greater reduction in cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a05h). Indicating that the sustained ERK activation, observed following IIH6 treatment, was not driven through integrin \u03b16.\n        As described above, EphA3 is co-localised with dystroglycan and integrin \u03b16. Following EphA3 IP we observed co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR in GBM cells, suggesting that EGFR is also present as a part of this complex and may be involved in regulating ERK activation (Online Resource 5d). To test if EGFR was responsible for driving sustained ERK activation following antibody treatment, neurospheres were pre-treated with either Gefitinib (2\u00a0\u00b5M) or Erlotinib (2\u00a0\u00b5M) prior to IIH6 treatment. EGFR inhibition did not prevent the induction of differentiation (Online Resource 5e). Taken together, this data suggests that \u03b1DG when bound to laminin, forms a complex with EphA2, EphA3, integrin \u03b16B, EGFR and likely other receptors to mediate a de-differentiated GSC mesenchymal-like phenotype through tight regulation of ERK signalling.\n      \n      \n        DAG1 down-regulation delays or prevents GBM formation in-vivo\n        To further define DG function in GBM we performed lentiviral DAG1 shRNA mediated KD, using a combination of\u00a0five target-specific 19\u201325 nucleotide sequences against DAG1, four GBM neurospheres lines were tested. Following effective constitutive KD in JK2, RN1 and WK1 cells (Fig.\u00a06a), we observed a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) reduction in proliferation (Fig.\u00a06b) and neurosphere loss typical of differentiating GBM cells (Fig.\u00a06c). In the case of SJH1, we observed a florid response to DAG1 KD; all cells underwent cell death within 7\u201314\u00a0days following KD (Online Resource 6a). Given this rapid response, SJH1 cells were excluded from further analysis. In-vitro DAG1 KD also reduced expression of EphA2, EphA3 and CD49f (integrin \u03b16) while markedly increasing the expression of the glial differentiation marker GFAP, indicating KD was inducing glial lineage differentiation (data shown for JK2) (Online Resource 6b). To explore if DAG1 KD reduced the tumourigenic potential of GBM cells in-vivo we performed orthotopic engraftment of control shRNA versus DAG1 KD cells into the right striatum of NOD/SCID mice. Animals were euthanised when signs of illness or disease burden were observed. The two highest DAG1 expressing lines (WK1-(CL), JK2-(MES)) were selected. Kaplan Meier survival analysis for WK1 showed DAG1 KD significantly increased overall survival p\u2009=\u20090.0266 (n\u2009=\u20094), median survival for control was 94\u00a0days versus DAG1 KD 109\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a06d). qPCR analysis of post-mortem tumour tissue confirmed a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.01) reduction in DAG1 mRNA levels compared to control shRNA engrafted animals (Online Resource 6c). Positive tumour formation was confirmed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in all control and DAG1 KD engrafted animals (Online Resource 6d). Kaplan Meier survival analysis for JK2 showed DAG1 KD significantly increased overall survival p\u2009=\u20090.0043 (n\u2009=\u20097), with no animals reaching survival endpoint, whereas median survival for control group was 195\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a06d). All DAG1 KD animals developed spontaneous thymic lymphoma, which is a common occurrence in this strain, and were euthanised as per our ethical guidelines [53]. Positive tumour formation was confirmed by H&E staining in all control shRNA engrafted animals, while no clinical signs of intracranial tumour formation were observed in DAG1 KD animals or intracranial tumour detected by H&E staining post-mortem (Fig.\u00a06e).Fig. 6DAG1 down regulation delays or prevents GBM formation in-vivo.a IF staining and QPCR was used to assess DAG1 mRNA levels following shRNA mediated KD in primary GBM cell lines. b Cell proliferation was assessed by direct cell counts using a haemocytometer following stable DAG1 KD.

See Online Resource 6d for WK1 H&E images\nElevated dystroglycan correlates with glioma patient outcome and \u03b1DG is abundantly glycosylated in GBM\n        \u03b1DG and \u03b2DG are transcribed from the Dystrophin-Associated Glycoprotein 1 (DAG1) gene. DG is translated as a single pre-pro-polypeptide. The receptor is autocatalytically cleaved into alpha and beta chains that remain non-covalently bound. The mucin-like domain of \u03b1DG becomes heavily glycosylated en-route to the surface membrane. Dystroglycan binds proteins of the extracellular matrix such as laminin by virtue of matriglycan (xylose and glucuronic acid polysaccharide). Receptor glycosylation is essential for proper function, without which \u03b1DG is unable to bind laminin [19, 42]. To determine if DAG1 was important in the context of brain cancer we interrogated both the Rembrandt and TCGA databases to correlate DAG1 gene expression with survival. In the context of GBM specifically and also glioma, patient tumours with elevated DAG1 led to a significantly shorter survival time (Fig.\u00a01a and Online Resource 1a). The Rembrandt database was also used to assess DAG1 gene expression in GBM as well as other forms of malignant brain cancer versus normal brain tissue. This revealed that DAG1 tended to correlate with tumour grade, as expression was highest in GBM compared to oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma cases, while all tumour types were elevated above normal brain tissue (Online Resource 1b). DAG1 expression in GBM was further stratified into molecular subtype [8, 59, 60]. DAG1 expression was highest in classical (CL) subtype GBM while approximately equivalent in other subtypes, mesenchymal (MES), proneural (PN) (Online Resource 1c). To assess the relative mRNA levels of DAG1 in GBM we performed QPCR on 28 GBM tumour specimens from our in-house tumour bank. We compared expression to other receptors (EPHA2, EPHA3 and ITGA6) previously identified as having a role in GSC maintenance. DAG1 levels were equivalent or higher to these receptors in all cases assessed (Fig.\u00a01b).Fig. 1Elevated Dystroglycan Correlates with GBM Patient Outcome and \u03b1DG is Abundantly Glycosylated in GBM. aDAG1 expression was correlated with GBM patient survival using the Rembrandt (n\u2009=\u2009523) and TCGA (n\u2009=\u2009453) databases. b QPCR analysis of DAG1, ITGA6, EPHA2 and EPHA3 mRNA expression in GBM tissue specimens (n\u2009=\u200928). c Flow cytometric analysis for \u03b1DG glycosylation (IIH6 mAb) was performed on primary GBM cell lines grown as serum-free GNS cultures, compared to isotype control. See also Online Research 1d for full analysis. d \u03b1DG glycosylation was assessed by western blot in four primary GBM cell lines. e \u03b1DG glycosylation was assessed by western blot following cell fractionation to compare cytoplasmic versus membrane localisation. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. f Flow cytometric analysis was performed for \u03b1DG glycosylation (IIH6 mAb) and EphA3 (IIIA4 mAb) in 10 early passage primary GBM cultures, mean channel fluorescence (mcf) was used to determine the correlation coefficient between EphA3 and glycosylated \u03b1DG (r\u2009=\u20090.899). GBM subtypes: MES mesenchymal, PN proneural, CL classical\n        Importantly, receptor function correlates closely with glycosylation status rather than gene expression. To determine the level of \u03b1DG glycosylation we used a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IIH6), previously developed by Campbell and colleagues, specific to glycan moieties on \u03b1DG with known receptor blocking function [20]. We have developed a GBM patient-derived cell line resource (Q-Cell) [14, 57] in which GBM lines are maintained as glioma neural stem cell (GNS) cultures [52]. This approach promotes a more de-differentiated stem cell-like phenotype in culture. We assessed a panel (n\u2009=\u200920) of subtype classified (n\u2009=\u200912) and unclassified (n\u2009=\u20098) early passage GBM cultures generated in-house. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the majority of the lines expressed high levels of glycosylated \u03b1DG irrespective of GBM molecular subtype (Fig.\u00a01c and Online Resource 1d). A panel of four IDH1 WT GBM lines were selected for further analysis, JK2-(MES), RN1-(MES), SJH1-(PN) and WK1-(CL), \u03b1DG protein expression was confirmed by western blot (WB) (Fig.\u00a01d). We next performed cell fractionation studies followed by WB on the panel of GBM lines, data indicated the majority of the protein was present in the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a01e).\n        A previous report in breast cancer had shown that EphA3 could regulate \u03b1DG [63]. Given these findings we assessed the co-expression of glycosylated \u03b1DG and EphA3 protein levels by flow cytometry. Mean channel fluorescence (mcf) analysis revealed a high correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.899) between glycosylated \u03b1DG and EphA3 in the primary GBM GNS lines tested (n\u2009=\u200910) (Fig.\u00a01f).\nGlycosylated \u03b1DG is expressed in the vascular niche and discretely on mesenchymal-like glioma tissue\n        To examine the spatial localisation and tumour specificity of glycosylated \u03b1DG (hereafter stated as \u03b1DG for simplicity), we first examined a variant of GBM, gliosarcoma (GS), which undergoes a partial process of de-differentiation with secondary loss of the glial differentiation marker GFAP and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics, a process similar to epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) [45]. GS is characterised histologically by a biphasic pattern of gliomatous glial-like (GFAP+) and sarcomatous mesenchymal-like (MES-like) (vimentin+) tumour elements (morphology shown in Fig.\u00a02a) [27, 45]. Common genetic alterations are found between GBM and GS, and both have a poor prognosis. A known clinical feature of GS is that the mesenchymal tumour compartment is highly migratory and infiltrates ECM protein-rich brain regions such as the leptomeninges [6]. As previously shown by others, the mesenchymal elements stain positive for vimentin [27]. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vimentin, and found a clear separation between glial-rich and predominantly mesenchymal-rich regions (Fig.\u00a02b). We next performed IHC on sequential GS tumour tissue sections to determine the localisation of \u03b1DG, \u03b2DG, EphA2 and EphA3. A representative example shows that \u03b1DG and EphA3 are expressed predominantly in regions, where mesenchymal tumour elements are present and expression is low or absent on the more differentiated GFAP+ glial tumour element (Fig.\u00a02c). This discrete pattern was not evident for EphA2 and \u03b2DG which showed comparable expression in both glial and mesenchymal tumour elements. The observed biphasic tumour tissue pattern in GS also appeared, although less dramatically discrete, in GBM specimens (Online Resource 2a). These regions were smaller and less prominent than in GS tumours, and also showed heterogeneous expression of GFAP, vimentin, EphA2, EphA3 \u03b1DG, CD49f and CD31, indicating that this tumour tissue patterning might also occur in GBM (Online Resource 2b). In addition, immunofluorescent (IF) staining revealed in GBM patient specimens (n\u2009=\u20093) that \u03b1DG staining was strongest in perivascular regions immediately surrounding tumour blood vessels (CD31+) (Fig.\u00a02d and Online Resource 2c).Fig. 2Glycosylated \u03b1DG is expressed in the vascular niche and discretely on Mesenchymal-like glioma tissue. a H&E section of a Gliosarcoma (GS) patient specimen showing characteristic biphasic gliomatous (glial-like) and sarcomatous (mesenchymal-like) tumour elements. b IHC analysis of a GS specimen to identify the mesenchymal-like, vimentin+, tumour element. c IHC analysis of sequential (#1\u20136) GS tissue sections was performed to assess expression patterns of EphA2, EphA3, \u03b1DG, \u03b2DG, CD31 and GFAP. d IF dual staining of a GBM specimen showing localisation of \u03b1DG expression (IIH6\u2014green) surrounding (CD31+\u2014red) tumour blood vessels, nuclei DAPI\u2014blue). See also Online Resource 2 for additional IHC and IF analysis in GBM tissue specimens\n\u03b1DG interacts with EphA2 and EphA3 receptors and is expressed on GSCs\n        Given the overlapping expression profile of EphA3 and \u03b1DG in GS and GBM tissue we wanted to assess the membrane localisation and potential interaction between these receptors. IF analysis showed a significant overlap in the membrane of EphA2, EphA3 and \u03b1DG in the four primary GBM cell lines tested (Fig.\u00a03a). To assess if these proteins could be complexed together we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of EphA3 in these lines. Results show co-immunoprecipitation of EphA3 with EphA2 and \u03b1DG (Fig.\u00a03b). To further confirm an association between these receptors we performed shRNA mediated EphA3 knockdown (KD) in SJH1 and JK2 cell lines. Following EphA3 KD a commensurate drop in \u03b1DG levels was observed (Online Resource 3a). These data suggest that \u03b1DG and EphA3 are likely associated in the cell membrane.Fig. 3\u03b1DG Interacts with EphA2 and EphA3 Receptors and is Expressed on GSCs. a IF staining was performed to compare membrane localisation of glycosylated \u03b1DG (IIH6 mAb\u2014red), compared to either EphA2 (1F7 mAb\u2014green) or EphA3 (IIIA4 mAb\u2014green), in four primary GBM cultures. b Immunoprecipitation (IP) for EphA3 was performed from 1\u00a0mg of lysate from four early passage primary GBM cultures to compare membrane association of EphA2, EphA3 and glycosylated \u03b1DG. Protein G only was used as a control. c Amnis flow cytometric analysis was performed on a dissociated GBM patient tissue specimen (n\u2009=\u20091) to assess membrane localisation of glycosylated \u03b1DG, with known GSC markers (CD15, CD133, CD49f, EphA2 and EphA3). d Amnis analysis and flow cytometry was performed on primary GBM cultures to assess membrane localisation of glycosylated \u03b1DG, with known GSC markers. e \u03b1DGhigh versus \u03b1DGlow populations were isolated from WK1 cells using FACS and cell morphology and sphere number assessed 7\u00a0days post-sort (*p\u2009<\u20090.05). GBM neuropshere differentiation was induced using 2% FBS, 3\u00a0days post-differentiation glycosylated \u03b1DG expression was assessed by flow cytometry and GSC and diff marker expression assessed by QPCR and compared to undifferentiated cells, see Online Resource 3 for complete analysis. All data presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments\n        We next used Amnis image stream technology, a flow cytometric approach which captures single-cell multi-colour fluorescent images. This approach was used to assess cell-surface co-expression of \u03b1DG with known GSC markers. Initially, this was performed on dissociated GBM patient tumour tissue (n\u2009=\u20091) obtained directly at time of surgery. Results show strong overlapping expression of \u03b1DG with EphA2, EphA3, CD49f (integrin \u03b16), CD133 and CD15 (Fig.\u00a03c). We repeated this analysis using both Amnis and standard flow cytometry using the panel of GBM cell lines (n\u2009=\u20094). Results demonstrated a similar pattern of co-expression of \u03b1DG especially with EphA2, EphA3 and CD49f, this was less pronounced for CD15, CD29 and CD133 (Fig.\u00a03d and Online Resource 3b,c). To assess stemness characteristics in the \u03b1DG high versus low expressing population we sorted WK1 GBM cells using FACS and performed a neurosphere assay. Results show that neurosphere formation was significantly elevated in the \u03b1DGhigh compared to the \u03b1DGlow population. In addition, we observed cell changes in the \u03b1DGlow population; low expressing cells that failed to form neurospheres displayed an attached differentiated cell morphology (Fig.\u00a03e). Post \u03b1DGhigh versus \u03b1DGlow sort we recombined the two cell populations and assessed \u03b1DG expression overtime. Interestingly, 14\u00a0days post-sort both low and high expressing populations were maintained, suggesting that these two unique populations can co-exist in culture for extended periods (Online Resource 3d). \u03b1DG expression and stemness characteristics should be lost following GSC differentiation. To test this we induced differentiation in our neurosphere cultures and 72\u00a0h post-differentiation assessed \u03b1DG expression by flow cytometry and GSC marker expression by QPCR. Results show a marked reduction in \u03b1DG protein expression following differentiation (Fig.\u00a03f), this was accompanied by significant gene downregulation of stemness markers and upregulation of the differentiation markers GFAP, \u03b2III-tubulin (TUBB3) and OLIG2 (Fig.\u00a03g and Online Resource 3e).\n\u03b1DG blockade induces GSC differentiation\n        To assess the contribution of \u03b1DG glycosylation to the progression of GBM and maintenance of a GSC phenotype, we employed an \u03b1DG mAb (IIH6) which specifically binds and blocks the ability of glycan moieties on \u03b1DG to bind laminin [20]. Following incubation of neurospheres with the IIH6 antibody, we observed a robust and rapid loss of sphere formation compared to cultures incubated with an isotype control mAb in which sphere integrity was maintained. The response was reliably observed in all primary cultures tested (Fig.\u00a04a). The observed differentiation response was dose dependent, while no response was observed with three independent IgM control antibodies (Online Resource 4a). Neurosphere loss is suggestive of differentiation and loss of proliferative ability. Differentiation was confirmed by acquisition of neuronal (\u03b2III-tubulin) and glial (GFAP) lineage markers (Fig.\u00a04b and Online Resource 4b). This differentiation response was quantitated using IncuCyte technology in real time and showed pronounced cell-attachment following IIH6 treatment (Fig.\u00a04c). The observed differentiation response was accompanied with a significant reduction in proliferation (p\u2009<\u20090.01) (Fig.\u00a04d). We observed negligible cell death induction in the short term (48\u00a0h) following antibody treatment (Fig.\u00a04e and Online Resource 4c). Interestingly, the differentiation effects were reversible if antibody was removed within seven days of treatment. If additional IIH6 mAb was added at seven days, the majority of rechallenged tumour cells showed pronounced cell morphology changes and ultimately underwent cell death within two weeks (Fig.\u00a04f). These data highlight the ability of GBM cells to recover during early differentiation but also susceptibility to prolonged terminal differentiation induced by the IIH6 antibody.Fig. 4\u03b1DG Blockade Induces GSC Differentiation. a Four primary GBM neurosphere cultures treated with the \u03b1DG blocking mAb (IIH6, 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) and an equivalent IgM control (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml).

WK1 data shown see also Online Resource 4b for complete analysis. c IncuCyte analysis was performed to quantitate cell adhesion in real time following IIH6 treatment-blue compared to an equivalent IgM control-red for 7\u00a0days (*p\u2009<\u20090.05). d Cell proliferation was assessed by direct cell counting using a haemocytometer 7\u00a0days post IIH6 treatment compared to IgM control and untreated cells (*p\u2009<\u20090.01). e ApoTox-Glo Triplex assay was used to assess caspase3/7 activity and cell viability 48\u00a0h post IIH6 treatment. WK1 data shown see also Online Resource 4c for complete analysis. f Neurosphere formation was assessed in WK1 cells following IIH6 withdrawal or re-addition following 7\u00a0days initial treatment. Bright field images at 2\u00a0weeks showing neurosphere re-formation following IIH6 withdrawal and cell death following IIH6 rechallenge. Data presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of three independent experiments\n\u03b1DG controls ERK signalling to regulate GSCs and promote an MES-like GBM state\n        Sustained ERK activation, as distinct from transient signalling, induces translocation of ERKs to the nucleus resulting in pro-differentiation transcriptional changes in neuronal cells [38]. Based upon our previous work and also the studies of others, it appears this mechanism is also observed in a number of cancers including GBM [13, 16]. We, therefore, assessed ERK activation following IIH6 treatment and found that pERK activation was sustained 24\u00a0h post-treatment (Fig.\u00a05a). Analysis of pERK cellular localisation, following IIH6 treatment, showed that activated ERK was predominantly localised the nucleus. The observed response was equivalent to a positive differentiation control (2% FBS), while in control-treated cells, the majority of pERK was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a05b). To examine if this same mechanism was operative in patient tissue and not an artefact of culture we assessed sequential (#1\u20134) GS tumour sections by IHC for \u03b1DG, EphA3, GFAP, pERK and Ki67. Results confirmed co-expression of \u03b1DG and EphA3 in the mesenchymal fraction which was discrete from the more differentiated GFAP+ glial fraction. pERK IHC staining revealed clear co-expression with the GFAP+ glial-predominant tumour regions which also showed less proliferation as shown by very low level Ki67 staining (Fig.\u00a05c). This data confirmed that sustained ERK activation occurs in high-grade glioma tissue and is restricted to the more differentiated, GFAP+, less mitotically active tumour regions.Fig. 5\u03b1DG Controls ERK Signalling to Regulate GSCs and Promote an MES-like GBM State. a ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) was assessed by western blot in WK1 GBM neurospheres following IIH6 (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) treatment for 24\u00a0h, compared an equivalent IgM control mAb (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) and untreated cells. \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. b IF staining was performed 24\u00a0h post IIH6 mAb treatment for pERK1/2\u2014green and \u03b1DG\u2014red to assess nuclear versus cytoplasmic localisation, 2% FBS was used as positive differentiation control. c IHC analysis of sequential (#1\u20134) GS tissue sections was performed to assess discrete expression patterns of \u03b1DG, EphA3, GFAP, pERK and Ki67 (non-sequential). d QPCR analysis of integrin \u03b16A, integrin \u03b16B, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Slug mRNA expression in GBM specimens (n\u2009=\u200928). e Correlation coefficient analysis of mRNA expression of the mesenchymal markers (Slug, Snail, Twist, Vimentin and N-cadherin) and the GSC markers (EphA3, CD15, CD133, CD49f and SOX2) in 6 primary early passage GBM GNS cultures. f QPCR analysis of VEGF-A, BMI-1 and ESRP1 mRNA expression in GBM specimens (n\u2009=\u200928). g ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) was assessed by western blot in WK1 GBM neurospheres following GoH3 (10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) or IIH6 (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) either alone or in combination compared an equivalent control mAb combination IgG2a (10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml)/IgM(50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml), \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. h Cell proliferation was assessed by direct cell counts using a haemocytometer 7\u00a0days post IIH6 treatment alone or combined with GoH3. Data presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments, *p\u2009<\u20090.05\n        A study in breast cancer found that tumour cell populations differ in expression of integrin \u03b16 cytoplasmic domain splice variants; \u03b16A is expressed on epithelial tumour cells while \u03b16B on mesenchymal tumour cells [26]. Data show that \u03b16B is the critical variant driving EMT and cancer stem cell function and promotes tumour initiation. Laminin-integrin interactions can activate ERK but only in cells expressing predominantly \u03b16A with an intact cytoplasmic tail, not \u03b16B [61]. While DG when bound to laminin, can suppress integrin a6-mediated ERK activation [23]. Integrin \u03b16 has previously been demonstrated to be expressed and functional in the GSC niche and is typically active in the process of niche formation and basement membrane attachment [11, 34]. We assessed \u03b16A and \u03b16B mRNA expression via QPCR in 28 GBM specimens. Results show that \u03b16B and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Slug are predominantly expressed, while \u03b16A and the epithelial marker E-cadherin are essentially absent (Fig.\u00a05d). We also investigated the relative mRNA levels of \u03b16A and \u03b16B in 6 primary GBM GNS cell lines and found an average 12.1 fold increase in \u03b16B compared to \u03b16A. This correlated with an average 210 fold increase in the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin compared to the E-cadherin (Online Resource 5a). In addition, \u03b16B correlated highly with mesenchymal and GSC markers in the primary GNS lines tested (n\u2009=\u20096) (Fig.\u00a05e). The oncogene BMI-1 is a stem cell factor and polycomb group family member that functions as a repressor of the splicing factor ESRP-1. Mercurio and colleagues show, in breast cancer, that \u03b16B is positively controlled by autocrine VEGF-A signalling that culminates in transcriptional repression of the RNA-splicing factor ESRP-1 [26]. We, therefore, assessed BMI-1, VEGF-A and ESRP-1 mRNA levels by QPCR in GNS cell lines (n\u2009=\u20096) (data not shown) and GBM tissue (n\u2009=\u200928), this revealed high levels of BMI-1 and VEGF-A, while ESRP-1 levels were undetected (Fig.\u00a05f). This suggests that a similar mechanism to that observed in breast cancer could be operative in GBM. To determine if integrin \u03b16 was responsible for driving sustained ERK activation following IIH6 treatment we performed an integrin \u03b16 shRNA mediated KD compared to control shRNA. These cells were then treated with the IIH6 blocking mAb, KD of integrin \u03b16 did not reverse the differentiation response. A similar response was observed when cells were pre-treated with the integrin \u03b16 blocking mAb GoH3 (Online Resource 5b, c). The GoH3 blocking antibody had little effect when used as a single agent on multiple GNS cell lines and did not appear to induce a differentiation response (data not shown). GoH3 treatment alone appeared to induce very low level ERK activation (Fig.\u00a05g). This was expected given the majority of integrin \u03b16 present is the \u03b16B splice variant with a truncated intracellular tail with reduced ERK signalling capacity. When IIH6 was combined with GoH3 we observed a somewhat more rapid differentiation response, this coincided with an increased level of sustained ERK activation than IIH6 alone 24\u00a0h post-treatment (Fig.\u00a05g), and a greater reduction in cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a05h). Indicating that the sustained ERK activation, observed following IIH6 treatment, was not driven through integrin \u03b16.\n        As described above, EphA3 is co-localised with dystroglycan and integrin \u03b16. Following EphA3 IP we observed co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR in GBM cells, suggesting that EGFR is also present as a part of this complex and may be involved in regulating ERK activation (Online Resource 5d). To test if EGFR was responsible for driving sustained ERK activation following antibody treatment, neurospheres were pre-treated with either Gefitinib (2\u00a0\u00b5M) or Erlotinib (2\u00a0\u00b5M) prior to IIH6 treatment. EGFR inhibition did not prevent the induction of differentiation (Online Resource 5e). Taken together, this data suggests that \u03b1DG when bound to laminin, forms a complex with EphA2, EphA3, integrin \u03b16B, EGFR and likely other receptors to mediate a de-differentiated GSC mesenchymal-like phenotype through tight regulation of ERK signalling.\nDiscussion\n      While decades of research have greatly increased our understanding of GBM, this knowledge is yet to translate into meaningful survival benefit for patients. We are now only starting to fully appreciate the true complexity and functional cellular states that reside within these aggressive tumours [46]. This plasticity and complex interaction with the TME is largely responsible for the modest clinical progress achieved to-date. Solid tumours, such as GBM, also harbour populations of cancer cells with stem cell-like abilities. These GSCs have the potential for self-renewal, tumour initiation and recurrence and often reside in necrotic and perivascular regions [28]. A better understanding of GSC biology and the functional elements that drive these dynamic cellular states in GBM will be required before meaningful clinical advances are likely to be made.\n      Dystroglycan biology and function in the brain is relatively understudied and less is known in the context of GBM. Concordant with our findings, Petrucci and colleagues found that transmembrane \u03b2DG was highly expressed on the majority of brain tumour tissue. They reported reduced \u03b1DG expression in two serum grown immortalised GBM cell lines (U87-MG and A172-MG) and showed positive expression in one EphA3+ GBM cell line (U251-MG), which we subsequently confirmed [10]. By flow cytometric analysis, we found significant \u03b1DG expression in 17/20 early passage primary GBM samples grown as serum-free GNS cultures. There appeared to be no correlation of expression with molecular subtype, this was expected as GNS cultures were grown on a basement membrane of laminin or matrigel which tends to promote a more MES-like de-differentiated phenotype irrespective of molecular subtype [5, 59, 62]. Our IHC and IF expression analysis demonstrated strong \u03b1DG expression around brain tumour blood vessels in patient specimens. This perivascular expression pattern confirms those of an earlier study [49]. We also detected abundant \u03b1DG expression in vimentin+, EphA3+, GFAPlow MES-like tumour regions. The number of Ki67 positive cells was elevated in \u03b1DG+/EphA3+/vimentin+ tumour regions compared to other regions, suggesting this tumour compartment was more mitotically active. Furthermore, we noted distinct morphological differences, \u03b1DG+/EphA3+/vimentin+ regions had an elongated, mesenchymal morphology, while negative regions had a more rounded, immotile appearance. While evident in both GBM and the GS tumours, this observation was most marked in GS and is consistent with disease biology, where the vimentin+ MES-like (sarcomatous) tumour cells are highly motile and migrate to BM-rich regions in the brain such as the leptomeninges [36, 37, 45]. GS is an uncommon variant of GBM and, despite exhibiting distinct sarcomatous and gliomatous tumour morphologies, are monoclonal tumours with GBM-associated genetic alterations [6]. While GBM are not epithelial tumours, the mesenchymal differentiation observed in GS tumours has been reported to occur through an EMT-like process [45]. In GBM we observed a similar, less prominent, pattern of MES-like \u03b1DG+/vimentin+ tumour tissue often detected in large tumour sections, indicating that GBM may also undergo a similar EMT-like process. Recently seminal studies from Suva and colleagues have described four states that exist within single GBM tumours to varying degrees. These states (MES-like, NPC-like, OPC-like and AC-like) are all driven by unique elements within the tumour and display unique properties [46]. They show that the MES-like NF1-driven regions express vimentin highly and interact frequently with the TME and immune infiltrate. Similar to our findings, they show that MES-like tissue contained considerable subsets of proliferating cells, reflecting the aggressive nature of the MES-like tumour compartment. Taken together, our data suggests that \u03b1DG, along with EphA3, are critical components of this MES-like tumour state, promoting functional interaction with BM proteins likely within the TME and perivascular niche.\n      We also observed a strong co-expression of \u03b1DG with other known GSC markers. This is not surprising given the recently identified roles of DG in regulating neural stem and progenitor cell commitment in the postnatal SVZ [39]. We found disruption of the strong connection of DG to laminin, either by \u03b1DG mAb blockade or DAG1 downregulation, led to pronounced loss of stem cell-like characteristics and induction of differentiation. Interestingly, the in-vitro effects of \u03b1DG mAb blockade were reversible within one week of treatment, while prolonged treatment resulted in tumour cell death suggestive of irreversible, terminal differentiation. In-vivo DAG1 KD studies were conducted using two models, WK1 (CL) and JK2 (MES), in the later mesenchymal model no tumours were detected in all DAG1 KD animals including a single animal which survived for 598\u00a0days post engraftment. Suggesting a strong reliance on \u03b1DG to tumour progression in this mesenchymal subtype model.\n      The strong link we found between \u03b1DG and EphA3 further confirmed our previous findings connecting EphA3 to an MES-like GSC phenotype [13]. A recent report by Singh and colleagues have shown that EphA3 is significantly elevated in recurrent GBM and cooperates with EphA2 to promote tumourigenesis [54]. Based on these findings, \u03b1DG may also be enriched in recurrent GBM. Sustained ERK activation induces translocation of ERKs to the nucleus resulting in pro-differentiation transcriptional changes in normal neuronal cells and some forms of cancer [16, 38]. In our previous work, we found EphA3 KD in GBM induced sustained ERK activation which induced differentiation and reduced cell growth and tumourigenicity [13]. This appeared true for \u03b1DG, antibody-mediated receptor blockade also led to sustained ERK activation and translocation of ERKs to the nucleus followed by GSC differentiation and ultimately cell death. We also observed this phenomenon in patient tissue, where more differentiated, GFAP+ Ki67low vimentinlow, tumour regions stained positive for phosphorylated ERK1/2, highlighting an active process during disease progression.\n      While the integrin-\u03b16A splice variant, through interaction with laminin, can activate the ERK pathway, our mRNA expression analysis of 28 tumour specimens showed that the integrin-\u03b16B splice variant was predominantly expressed in GBM and correlated with mesenchymal markers. \u03b16B is strongly linked with a mesenchymal stem cell signature in breast cancer [26], and has a truncated intracellular domain which cannot actively signal the ERK pathway [61]. Thus, in GBM when \u03b1DG is bound to BM proteins such as laminin, \u03b2DG most likely sequesters MEK and ERK to prevent ERK pathway activation, [23, 56] (see model Fig.\u00a07). Our findings indicate that the \u03b1-subunit of the DG receptor, when bound to laminin, is predominantly acting as a brake on ERK activation, thereby maintaining GSCs and the MES-like population within BM-rich regions and niches within these tumours.Fig. 7The dystroglycan complex supresses MAPK activation to regulate glioma Stem cell commitment. DG, when bound to laminin, cooperates with EphA3 and integrin \u03b16B in the vascular niche to maintain a GSC mesenchymal phenotype. Functionally, DG and integrin \u03b16B limit sustained ERK activation preventing GSC differentiation. Blockade of \u03b1DG glycosylation sites, using the IIH6 mAb, induced sustained ERK1/2 activation, leading to translocation of ERKs to the nucleus followed by GSC differentiation and reduced GBM aggressiveness\n      DG is expressed widely throughout the body, especially in skeletal muscle, making potential therapeutic targeting of this receptor challenging. It appears that unique brain dystroglycan glycoepitopes have been identified and antibodies raised to recognise these unique glycan moieties [40]. It is conceivable that an \u03b1DG brain-specific targeting antibody could be developed, though targeting of normal brain would still be undesirable. This could be overcome through the use of bi-specific targeting strategies with tumour-specific antigens, such as EphA3.\n      Reduction or loss of DG expression has been reported in several epithelial tumours such as breast, colon, and prostate cancers, implicating the receptor in tumour invasion and dissemination [30, 55]. A potential mechanism to explain this phenomenon is degradation of \u03b2DG by MMPs in the TME [33]. Additionally, defects in \u03b1DG glycosylation may also play a role in cancer progression.\u00a0A number of cancers of epithelial origin show an association between loss of \u03b1DG glycosylation and tumour progression. A report of this mechanism has also been shown for GBM [1]. Among several \u03b1DG glycosylation related genes, LARGE may have a great impact on cancer biology and the silencing of LARGE promotes cancer cell\u00a0migration and anchorage-dependent growth [15, 21]. Contrary to these studies, our findings indicate that glycosylated \u03b1DG maintains a robust MES-like phenotype likely by promoting interaction with BM proteins in the TME and further acts to anchor GSCs within the vascular niche. Given the significant heterogeneity present in GBM, both mechanisms are likely true, where \u03b1DG glycosylation is tuned to maintain MES-like or GSC states, as tumour cells exit these niches, \u03b1DG expression is lost and tumour cell differentiation and state change occurs.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851226/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-019-02069-x",
