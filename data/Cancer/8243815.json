    "description": "Background\n          Prospective evidence on associations between diet quality indices and lung\ncancer risk is limited, particularly among older women.\nObjectives\n          We investigated associations between 4 diet quality indices [Healthy Eating\nIndex-2015 (HEI-2015), Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010),\nalternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop\nHypertension (DASH)] and lung cancer incidence and mortality in the\nWomen's Health Initiative Observational Study.\nMethods\n          Postmenopausal women aged 50\u201379 y at baseline (1993\u20131998) self\nreported their diet intake and information on relevant covariates. We used\nCox proportional hazards regression models to estimate HRs and 95%\nCIs after controlling for age, smoking, and other relevant covariates.\nResults\n          During \u223c17 y of follow-up among 86,090 participants, 1491 lung cancer\ncases and 1393 lung cancer deaths were documented. Dietary indices were not\nassociated with overall lung cancer incidence but were protective against\nsquamous cell carcinoma (12.8% of total lung cancer) cases (HEI-2015:\nHR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.96; AHEI-2010: HR: 0.87; 95% CI:\n0.78, 0.98; aMED: HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.99; DASH: HR: 0.87;\n95% CI: 0.77, 0.98). Among the indices, only HEI-2015 showed an\ninverse trend\n(P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.02) with\noverall lung cancer mortality. Smoking status or participant age at baseline\ndid not modify the association between dietary indices and lung cancer\nincidence or mortality.\nConclusions\n          After comprehensive control of smoking exposure, we found that diet quality\nwas not associated with overall lung cancer among postmenopausal women.\nHowever, a high-quality diet was inversely related to incident lung cancer\nof the squamous cell subtype. Future studies in populations with diverse\nage, smoking history, and dietary intake may further elucidate the relation\nbetween diet quality indices and lung cancer, especially by histological\nsubtype.",
