    "abstract": "Over 80% of women presenting for breast cancer treatment in Uganda have late stage disease, attributable to a dysfunctional referral system, lack of recognition of early signs and symptoms among primary healthcare providers, compounding the poor infrastructure and inadequate human capacity. Deficits in the recognition of breast cancer signs and symptoms, under-utilization of clinical breast examination as a diagnostic and/or screening tool, centralization of diagnostic tests (radiology and pathology), reliance on excisional biopsies rather than needle biopsies, lack of trained professionals and knowledge of the referral system all contribute to significant health system delays. To strengthen referral networks and improve breast cancer early diagnosis in Uganda, national referral hospitals should provide educational programs to primary healthcare providers in community health centers where most women first present with symptoms.",

    "description": "Background.\n          Over 80% of women presenting for breast cancer treatment in Uganda have late stage disease, attributable to a dysfunctional referral system, lack of recognition of early signs and symptoms among primary healthcare providers, compounding the poor infrastructure and inadequate human capacity. Improving the breast healthcare system requires a systemic approach beginning with situation analysis to identify systematic gaps that prevent sustainable improvements in outcome.\nMethods.\n          We performed a situational analysis of the breast healthcare system utilizing methods developed by Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI). Based on our findings, we developed a series of recommendations for health system strengthening for breast cancer early diagnosis based on clinical detection, referral, tissue sampling and diagnosis.\nResults.\n          Deficits in the recognition of breast cancer signs and symptoms, under-utilization of clinical breast examination as a diagnostic and/or screening tool, centralization of diagnostic tests (radiology and pathology), reliance on excisional biopsies rather than needle biopsies, lack of trained professionals and knowledge of the referral system all contribute to significant health system delays.\nConclusions.\n          To strengthen referral networks and improve breast cancer early diagnosis in Uganda, national referral hospitals should provide educational programs to primary healthcare providers in community health centers where most women first present with symptoms. At secondary district-level facilities where imaging and tissue sampling can be performed, the capacity for diagnostic testing could be increased through task shifting of basic interpretation (abnormal versus normal) from specialists to non-specialists using networking technology to facilitate remote oversight from specialists at the national referral hospitals.",
