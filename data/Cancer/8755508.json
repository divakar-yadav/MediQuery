    "description": "Background\n          Recent population-based female breast cancer and prostate cancer polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been developed. We assessed the associations of these PRS with breast and prostate cancer risks for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers.\nMethods\n      Statistical analyses were performed using R-3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (commands can be found in the Supplementary Methods, available online).\n      \n        Study Participants and Genotyping\n        Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers were recruited through 40 studies from 19 countries participating in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (CIMBA) (24). The majority of male carriers were ascertained through families attending cancer genetic clinics (96.9%; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available online). In this setting, individuals are referred to clinical genetics because of strong family or personal cancer history. The first individual in a family, screened for mutations, tends to be an affected individual diagnosed at a young age, most often a female relative with a young age at breast cancer diagnosis (24). When a pathogenic variant is identified, then other family members are tested for the same variant. All participants were aged 18\u2009years or older and provided written informed consent. All studies were approved by local ethical review committees. A total of 1989 male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers of European ancestry were included in the present study, by selecting all available men with a breast or prostate cancer diagnosis and matched controls. Details of matching, genotyping, and quality control processes have been described previously (17) and in Supplementary Table 2 (available online).\n        Data collected included breast or prostate cancer diagnoses; age at diagnosis or interview; prostate cancer Gleason score; breast cancer ER status and grade; and family history of prostate, male breast, and female breast cancers among first- and second-degree relatives. BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants (detailed pathogenicity description: http://cimba.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/files/CIMBA_Mutation_Classification_guidelines_May16.pdf) were categorized according to their known or predicted effect on protein function: class I included loss-of-function variants expected to yield unstable or no protein; class II included variants likely to produce stable mutant proteins (25). Pathology data were obtained from pathology reviews; medical, pathology or tumor registry records; or immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays (26).\n      \n      \n        Polygenic Risk Scores\n        PRS were constructed as the weighted sums of alleles (Supplementary Methods, available online) for 313-SNPs for breast cancer (21) and 147-SNPs for prostate cancer (15) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, available online). Three breast cancer PRS were evaluated, optimized to predict overall (PRSBC), ER-negative (PRSER-), and ER-positive (PRSER+) breast cancer (21). These PRS were scaled to the female population-based control PRS standard deviation (21). The prostate cancer PRS (PRSPC) was scaled to the standard deviation calculated from population-based controls (15).\n      \n      \n        Associations Between PRS and Cancer Risks\n        PRS associations with breast and prostate cancer risks were assessed simultaneously using multinomial logistic regression to estimate per standard deviation odds ratios. Men without breast or prostate cancer diagnoses were considered controls. Breast and prostate cancer cases were defined by considering the first occurring cancer. Instances in which breast and prostate cancers were diagnosed simultaneously were considered as breast cancer cases. Statistical models were adjusted for 3 ancestry informative principal components (proxy adjustment for study and/or country , as a direct adjustment would result in too few controls and cases within each study and/or country; Supplementary Table 1, available online) and age. Models using the combined sample of carriers were adjusted for BRCA1 and BRCA2 status. To account for relatedness, we estimated robust variances by clustering on family membership (27,28). The primary analyses assumed a continuous PRS. Categorical PRS associations were evaluated using the quartiles of the PRS distributions in the combined BRCA1 and BRCA2 carrier controls.\n        Because the distribution of tumor ER status in male carriers may differ from the distributions in the general population (26), we assessed the associations between all 3 versions of the breast cancer PRS with overall breast cancer risk and ER-specific disease. Associations with ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer were assessed simultaneously by considering ER negative, ER positive, or unknown as distinct multinomial outcomes. We also assessed the associations with breast cancer grade-specific risk by considering grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, or unknown grade as separate multinomial outcomes. A case-only logistic regression also was undertaken that considered grades 1 and 2 as controls and grade 3 as cases.\n        To assess the PRSPC association with disease aggressiveness, we partitioned prostate cancers into those with Gleason scores less than 7, 7 or greater, or unknown, and these were used as distinct multinomial outcomes. A case-only logistic regression assessed differences in the associations with Gleason scores less than 7 (controls) and Gleason scores of 7 or greater (cases).\n        Discriminatory ability of each PRS was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Under the sampling design, the majority of male carriers were identified through clinical genetics. Therefore, the majority of both affected and unaffected carriers are expected to have family history of cancer. To determine whether this introduces any biases in the PRS associations, we fitted models that were adjusted for family history in first- and second-degree relatives.\n        To determine whether PRS associations varied by age (continuous), pathogenic variant location, or pathogenic variant effects on protein function (class I or class II variants), we estimated interaction terms between these factors with the PRS, and statistical significance was assessed using likelihood ratio tests (LRT). Pathogenic variants were categorized based on previously reported nucleotide position differences in breast and ovarian, or prostate cancer risks (29\u201331).\n        We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test for PRS heterogeneity across study countries (Supplementary Methods, available online).\n        All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\n      \n      \n        Predicted Age-Specific Absolute and 10-Year Cancer Risks by PRS\n        We predicted absolute risks up to age 85\u2009years and 10-year risks of developing breast and prostate cancers by PRS distribution percentiles, assuming the estimated PRS odds ratio follows a log-linear model across the entire PRS range (Supplementary Methods, available online) (32).\nResults\n      \n        Study Participants and Genotyping\n        After quality control, the analyses included 483 BRCA1 (33 breast and 70 prostate cancer cases) and 1318 BRCA2 (244 breast and 141 prostate cancer cases) carriers of European ancestry (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available online).\n        All SNPs from both PRS were well imputed (r2\u2265 0.76; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, available online). Average PRS were larger for cases compared with controls (Supplementary Table 2, available online).\n      \n      \n        Associations With Breast Cancer Risk\n        The associations between the breast cancer PRS and male breast cancer risk for carriers are shown in Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 (available online). The PRSER+ yielded the strongest associations with overall breast cancer risk for BRCA1 (OR\u2009=\u20091.40, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.83) and BRCA2 (OR\u2009=\u20091.33, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.52) carriers. The PRSBC resulted in nearly identical associations as the PRSER+. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRSER+ associations differed by country (Pheterogeneity \u2265 .48; Supplementary Figure 3, available online). In the joint analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, men in the uppermost PRSER+ quartile had approximately twofold increased breast cancer risk (OR\u2009=\u20092.10, 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.08) compared with men in the lowest quartile (Supplementary Table 6, available online).\n        \n          Table 1.\n          \n            Breast cancer PRS associations with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 and

The number of ER-negative cancers was too small to assess associations with ER-negative disease. There was no statistically significant evidence for differences in the associations of any of the PRS by grade (Table\u00a01; Supplementary Table 6, available online).\n        The ability of PRSER+ to discriminate between controls and breast cancer cases was estimated as an AUC of 0.60 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.69) for BRCA1 and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.55 to 0.63) for BRCA2 carriers.\n      \n      \n        Associations With Prostate Cancer Risk\n        The estimated associations between the PRSPC and prostate cancer risk for male carriers are reported in Table\u00a02 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 7 (available online). The odds ratios per PRSPC standard deviation were estimated to be 1.73 (95% CI = 1.28 to 2.33) for BRCA1 and 1.60 (95% CI = 1.34 to 1.91) for BRCA2 carriers. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRSPC associations differed by country (Pheterogeneity \u2265 .14; Supplementary Figure 4, available online). In the joint analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, men in the top PRSPC quartile had a prostate cancer odds ratio of 3.35 (95% CI = 2.06 to 5.42) compared with men in the lowest quartile (Supplementary Table 7, available online).\n        \n          Table 2.\n          \n            Prostate cancer PRS associations with prostate cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers\n          \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                PRS investigated and outcome\n                \nBRCA1 carriers\n                \nBRCA2 carriers\n              \n              \n                No. of controls\n                No. of cases\n                OR (95% CI)\n                \nP\n\na\n\n\n                No. of controls\n                No. of cases\n                OR (95% CI)\n                \nP\n\na\n\n\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Continuousb\n                380\n                70\n                1.73 (1.28 to 2.33)\n                <.001\n                933\n                141\n                1.60 (1.34 to 1.91)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                Continuous: adjusted for FHc\n                380\n                70\n                1.74 (1.29 to 2.35)\n                <.001\n                933\n                141\n                1.59 (1.32 to 1.90)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                PRSPC association with Gleason score (GS)\u2013specific prostate cancer riskd\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n                \u2003Controls\n                380\n                \u2014\n                1.00 (referent)\n                933\n                \u2014\n                1.00 (referent)\n              \n              \n                \u2003GS < 7\n                \u2014\n                26\n                1.11 (0.70 to 1.77)\n                .66\n                \u2014\n                27\n                1.83 (1.29 to 2.58)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                \u2003GS \u2265 7\n                \u2014\n                21\n                2.09 (1.27 to 3.46)\n                .004\n                \u2014\n                82\n                1.68 (1.32 to 2.13)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                \u2003GS unknown\n                \u2014\n                23\n                2.38 (1.49 to 3.80)\n                <.001\n                \u2014\n                32\n                1.26 (0.95 to 1.68)\n                .11\n              \n              \n                Case-only analysis: GS \u2265 7 vs GS < 7e\n                26\n                21\n                1.87 (1.01 to 3.44)\n                .05\n                27\n                82\n                0.93 (0.63 to 1.37)\n                .72\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \na\n\n              \nP value was calculated using a 2-sided Wald test.

There were no differences in the PRSPC associations with high- or low-Gleason score among BRCA2 carriers (Table\u00a02).\n        The PRSPC discriminatory ability was estimated as an AUC of 0.62 (95% CI = 0.54 to 0.69) for BRCA1 and 0.62 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.67) for BRCA2 carriers.\n      \n      \n        Adjusting for Cancer Family History\n        Adjusting for family history of male breast cancer did not influence the PRSER+ associations with breast cancer risk (Table\u00a01;Supplementary Table 8, available online). However, the odds ratio estimates were somewhat larger when adjusting for female breast cancer family history (Table\u00a01;Supplementary Table 9, available online).\n        The associations of PRSPC

The corresponding risks for BRCA2 carriers were 34.1% and 87.6%. BRCA2 carriers had 10-year risks of 2.1% and 10.1% at the 5th and 95th PRSPC percentiles at age 50\u2009years, respectively. The corresponding risks at age 75\u2009years were 25.5% and 77.0% (Figure\u00a02).\nConclusions\n          Population-based prostate and female breast cancer PRS are associated with a wide range of absolute breast and prostate cancer risks for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. These findings warrant further investigation aimed at providing personalized cancer risks for male carriers and informing clinical management.\nStudy Participants and Genotyping\n        After quality control, the analyses included 483 BRCA1 (33 breast and 70 prostate cancer cases) and 1318 BRCA2 (244 breast and 141 prostate cancer cases) carriers of European ancestry (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available online).\n        All SNPs from both PRS were well imputed (r2\u2265 0.76; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, available online). Average PRS were larger for cases compared with controls (Supplementary Table 2, available online).\nPolygenic Risk Scores\n        PRS were constructed as the weighted sums of alleles (Supplementary Methods, available online) for 313-SNPs for breast cancer (21) and 147-SNPs for prostate cancer (15) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, available online). Three breast cancer PRS were evaluated, optimized to predict overall (PRSBC), ER-negative (PRSER-), and ER-positive (PRSER+) breast cancer (21). These PRS were scaled to the female population-based control PRS standard deviation (21). The prostate cancer PRS (PRSPC) was scaled to the standard deviation calculated from population-based controls (15).\nAssociations Between PRS and Cancer Risks\n        PRS associations with breast and prostate cancer risks were assessed simultaneously using multinomial logistic regression to estimate per standard deviation odds ratios. Men without breast or prostate cancer diagnoses were considered controls. Breast and prostate cancer cases were defined by considering the first occurring cancer. Instances in which breast and prostate cancers were diagnosed simultaneously were considered as breast cancer cases. Statistical models were adjusted for 3 ancestry informative principal components (proxy adjustment for study and/or country , as a direct adjustment would result in too few controls and cases within each study and/or country; Supplementary Table 1, available online) and age. Models using the combined sample of carriers were adjusted for BRCA1 and BRCA2 status. To account for relatedness, we estimated robust variances by clustering on family membership (27,28). The primary analyses assumed a continuous PRS. Categorical PRS associations were evaluated using the quartiles of the PRS distributions in the combined BRCA1 and BRCA2 carrier controls.\n        Because the distribution of tumor ER status in male carriers may differ from the distributions in the general population (26), we assessed the associations between all 3 versions of the breast cancer PRS with overall breast cancer risk and ER-specific disease. Associations with ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer were assessed simultaneously by considering ER negative, ER positive, or unknown as distinct multinomial outcomes. We also assessed the associations with breast cancer grade-specific risk by considering grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, or unknown grade as separate multinomial outcomes. A case-only logistic regression also was undertaken that considered grades 1 and 2 as controls and grade 3 as cases.\n        To assess the PRSPC association with disease aggressiveness, we partitioned prostate cancers into those with Gleason scores less than 7, 7 or greater, or unknown, and these were used as distinct multinomial outcomes. A case-only logistic regression assessed differences in the associations with Gleason scores less than 7 (controls) and Gleason scores of 7 or greater (cases).\n        Discriminatory ability of each PRS was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Under the sampling design, the majority of male carriers were identified through clinical genetics. Therefore, the majority of both affected and unaffected carriers are expected to have family history of cancer. To determine whether this introduces any biases in the PRS associations, we fitted models that were adjusted for family history in first- and second-degree relatives.\n        To determine whether PRS associations varied by age (continuous), pathogenic variant location, or pathogenic variant effects on protein function (class I or class II variants), we estimated interaction terms between these factors with the PRS, and statistical significance was assessed using likelihood ratio tests (LRT). Pathogenic variants were categorized based on previously reported nucleotide position differences in breast and ovarian, or prostate cancer risks (29\u201331).\n        We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test for PRS heterogeneity across study countries (Supplementary Methods, available online).\n        All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\nPredicted Age-Specific Absolute and 10-Year Cancer Risks by PRS\n        We predicted absolute risks up to age 85\u2009years and 10-year risks of developing breast and prostate cancers by PRS distribution percentiles, assuming the estimated PRS odds ratio follows a log-linear model across the entire PRS range (Supplementary Methods, available online) (32).\nAssociations With Breast Cancer Risk\n        The associations between the breast cancer PRS and male breast cancer risk for carriers are shown in Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 (available online). The PRSER+ yielded the strongest associations with overall breast cancer risk for BRCA1 (OR\u2009=\u20091.40, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.83) and BRCA2 (OR\u2009=\u20091.33, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.52) carriers. The PRSBC resulted in nearly identical associations as the PRSER+. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRSER+ associations differed by country (Pheterogeneity \u2265 .48; Supplementary Figure 3, available online). In the joint analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, men in the uppermost PRSER+ quartile had approximately twofold increased breast cancer risk (OR\u2009=\u20092.10, 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.08) compared with men in the lowest quartile (Supplementary Table 6, available online).\n        \n          Table 1.\n          \n            Breast cancer PRS associations with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 and

The number of ER-negative cancers was too small to assess associations with ER-negative disease. There was no statistically significant evidence for differences in the associations of any of the PRS by grade (Table\u00a01; Supplementary Table 6, available online).\n        The ability of PRSER+ to discriminate between controls and breast cancer cases was estimated as an AUC of 0.60 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.69) for BRCA1 and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.55 to 0.63) for BRCA2 carriers.\nAssociations With Prostate Cancer Risk\n        The estimated associations between the PRSPC and prostate cancer risk for male carriers are reported in Table\u00a02 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 7 (available online). The odds ratios per PRSPC standard deviation were estimated to be 1.73 (95% CI = 1.28 to 2.33) for BRCA1 and 1.60 (95% CI = 1.34 to 1.91) for BRCA2 carriers. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRSPC associations differed by country (Pheterogeneity \u2265 .14; Supplementary Figure 4, available online). In the joint analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, men in the top PRSPC quartile had a prostate cancer odds ratio of 3.35 (95% CI = 2.06 to 5.42) compared with men in the lowest quartile (Supplementary Table 7, available online).\n        \n          Table 2.\n          \n            Prostate cancer PRS associations with prostate cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers\n          \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                PRS investigated and outcome\n                \nBRCA1 carriers\n                \nBRCA2 carriers\n              \n              \n                No. of controls\n                No. of cases\n                OR (95% CI)\n                \nP\n\na\n\n\n                No. of controls\n                No. of cases\n                OR (95% CI)\n                \nP\n\na\n\n\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Continuousb\n                380\n                70\n                1.73 (1.28 to 2.33)\n                <.001\n                933\n                141\n                1.60 (1.34 to 1.91)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                Continuous: adjusted for FHc\n                380\n                70\n                1.74 (1.29 to 2.35)\n                <.001\n                933\n                141\n                1.59 (1.32 to 1.90)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                PRSPC association with Gleason score (GS)\u2013specific prostate cancer riskd\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n                \u2003Controls\n                380\n                \u2014\n                1.00 (referent)\n                933\n                \u2014\n                1.00 (referent)\n              \n              \n                \u2003GS < 7\n                \u2014\n                26\n                1.11 (0.70 to 1.77)\n                .66\n                \u2014\n                27\n                1.83 (1.29 to 2.58)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                \u2003GS \u2265 7\n                \u2014\n                21\n                2.09 (1.27 to 3.46)\n                .004\n                \u2014\n                82\n                1.68 (1.32 to 2.13)\n                <.001\n              \n              \n                \u2003GS unknown\n                \u2014\n                23\n                2.38 (1.49 to 3.80)\n                <.001\n                \u2014\n                32\n                1.26 (0.95 to 1.68)\n                .11\n              \n              \n                Case-only analysis: GS \u2265 7 vs GS < 7e\n                26\n                21\n                1.87 (1.01 to 3.44)\n                .05\n                27\n                82\n                0.93 (0.63 to 1.37)\n                .72\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \na\n\n              \nP value was calculated using a 2-sided Wald test.

There were no differences in the PRSPC associations with high- or low-Gleason score among BRCA2 carriers (Table\u00a02).\n        The PRSPC discriminatory ability was estimated as an AUC of 0.62 (95% CI = 0.54 to 0.69) for BRCA1 and 0.62 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.67) for BRCA2 carriers.\nAdjusting for Cancer Family History\n        Adjusting for family history of male breast cancer did not influence the PRSER+ associations with breast cancer risk (Table\u00a01;Supplementary Table 8, available online). However, the odds ratio estimates were somewhat larger when adjusting for female breast cancer family history (Table\u00a01;Supplementary Table 9, available online).\n        The associations of PRSPC with prostate cancer risk remained similar after adjusting for prostate cancer family history (Table\u00a02;Supplementary Table 10, available online).\nPRS Interactions With Age and Gene Pathogenic

However, these differences were not statistically significant (PLRT \u2265 .26).\n        There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRSER+ (PLRT \u2265 .61) or PRSPC (PLRT = .52) associations differed by the pathogenic variant location in the gene (Table\u00a03).\nAbsolute Risks of Developing Breast and Prostate Cancer\n        The absolute risks of developing breast cancer by age 85\u2009years for BRCA2 carriers was predicted to be 7.7% at the 5th and 18.4% at the 95th PRSER+ distribution percentiles (Figure\u00a01).

The corresponding risks for BRCA2 carriers were 34.1% and 87.6%. BRCA2 carriers had 10-year risks of 2.1% and 10.1% at the 5th and 95th PRSPC percentiles at age 50\u2009years, respectively. The corresponding risks at age 75\u2009years were 25.5% and 77.0% (Figure\u00a02).\nDiscussion\n      We evaluated the associations of the most recently developed breast and prostate cancer PRS with site-specific cancer risks in the largest case-control study of male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers available to date. Our findings showed that these PRS, developed using population-based data, are associated with breast and prostate cancer risks for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Despite the modest estimated AUCs, our results demonstrate that because male carriers are already at elevated risks of developing breast and prostate cancers, these PRS can lead to large differences in the absolute cancer risks for carriers across PRS percentiles.\n      PRSBC and PRSER+ were associated with larger odds ratio estimates than PRSER- in predicting breast cancer risk, consistent with the fact that most breast cancers in men are ER positive, including those harboring BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants (26). Similarly, when assessing associations with ER-positive breast cancer risk, PRSBC and PRSER+ showed the strongest associations for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. There were no differences in PRS associations by breast cancer grade.\n      The 147-SNP PRSPC (15) yielded larger per standard deviation odds ratio estimates than a previously evaluated 103-SNP prostate cancer PRS (17). There was some evidence that PRSPC may be associated with a higher odds ratio for more aggressive disease (Gleason score \u22657) for BRCA1 carriers. This pattern was not observed for BRCA2 carriers, who tend to develop more aggressive disease (5). If this finding is replicated by larger studies, the PRS may prove to be useful in cancer prevention and surveillance by identifying BRCA1 carriers at greater risk of developing aggressive prostate cancers.\n      PRS associations with breast or prostate cancer risk, adjusted for family history of male breast or prostate cancer, were similar to unadjusted estimates, suggesting that cancer family history in male relatives does not alter PRS associations. Adjusting for family history of female breast cancer resulted in somewhat larger odds ratio estimates for the breast cancer PRS compared with unadjusted estimates. This observation is consistent with male carriers being identified and recruited into our studies mostly based on their female relatives\u2019 breast cancers.\n      There was little evidence supporting variability in PRS associations by age or pathogenic variant characteristics. However, larger sample sizes are required to reliably assess such differences, and the current analyses were likely underpowered.\n      Previous studies (18,33) suggest the magnitude of the breast cancer PRS associations is attenuated in female BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers compared with associations seen in the general population (21). As seen for female carriers, the estimated breast cancer odds ratios for male carriers were attenuated compared with estimates for women in the general population (21). Similarly, the estimated prostate cancer odds ratio estimate for male carriers was attenuated compared with population-based data (15). Taken together, these observations suggest there is a deviation from the multiplicative model for the joint effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants and the PRS for male and female carriers. These observed attenuations for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers are unlikely to be an overestimation of the effects in the general population [\u201cwinner\u2019s curse\u201d (34)], as they have been validated in independent prospective cohorts (21). The lower odds ratios for the breast and prostate cancer PRS in male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, compared with the general population, may reflect a general attenuation of the effect sizes of common variants on genetic risk in the presence of a pathogenic variant in a high-risk gene (35,36). This supposition may also explain the larger PRS odds ratios for BRCA1 carriers, who are at lower risk compared with BRCA2 carriers (37). However, given the current study design, we cannot rule out that the observed attenuations in effect size are related to ascertainment biases. Although adjusting for family history did not change the odds ratio estimates substantially, residual confounding may still remain. Large-scale population studies will be required to address this. If the attenuations in the PRS effect size are real, they would result in a smaller range of cancer risks for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers compared with using the PRS effect sizes estimated from general population data.\n      Although breast cancer risk stratification might not currently be feasible for men in the general population, male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers may represent a group likely to benefit from a more refined stratification of their individual breast and prostate cancer risks, to better inform their clinical management. At present, limited recommendations based on low-level evidence or expert opinion are available for male carriers. Current guidelines recommend clinical breast examinations beginning at ages 30-35\u2009years and suggest mammographic screening on an individual basis, whereas clinical prostate cancer screening, particularly for BRCA2 carriers, is recommended from ages 40 to 45\u2009years (38\u201340).\n      The PRS percentile-specific absolute risks varied substantially over the PRS distribution, consistent with previous studies in male (17) and female (16,18) BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. At least twofold increased risk is often considered a clinically actionable level for breast and prostate cancers (41). Our findings may inform the development of age-specific clinical recommendations and provide guidance on when to start risk-adapted screening, based on their PRS percentile-specific 10-year risks. Overall, refined risk estimates may be useful to distinguish male carriers at higher risk, who may benefit from enhanced and/or earlier screening, and identify carriers at lower risk, who may opt for more limited or postponed surveillance. Identification of men at lower risk of prostate cancer by PRS stratification has been shown to be useful in reducing overdiagnosis in the general population, resulting in a reduction in the harms associated with prostate-specific antigen testing (42). Similar arguments may apply to male carriers in whom PRS prediction may further improve screening efficacy.\n      Strengths of this study include the fact that this is an independent validation of the most recently derived breast (21) and prostate (15) cancer PRS derived from population-based data. We benefited from the availability of Gleason scores and breast cancer ER status and grade; hence, we could assess subtype-specific associations. Finally, we assumed recent prospectively estimated prostate cancer incidence rates (5) to predict absolute prostate cancer risks, which may be more representative of risks for carriers currently seen in clinical genetics centers.\n      Study limitations include the limited sample size to assess PRS associations with cancer risks for subgroups of male carriers. However, these data remain the largest male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carrier case-control study with available genotype data. The breast (21) and prostate (15) cancer PRS do not include male breast cancer-specific risk-associated SNPs or SNPs that may specifically be associated with prostate cancer risk for carriers. If such SNPs exist, further improvement may be gained in risk prediction by including them in PRS. The absolute risk calculations assumed that the PRS odds ratio behaves log linearly over the PRS range. It was difficult to evaluate this assumption in the present analyses because of the limited sample size of male carriers. However, empirical evidence based on larger sample sizes of female carriers (18) or in the general population (15,21) suggests that this assumption is plausible. Additionally, the absolute breast and prostate cancer risk predictions by PRS will require validation in large prospective studies of male carriers with long-term follow-up, although such studies remain a challenge. Finally, the PRS that we investigated were derived using European ancestry data; hence, our estimated associations and predicted risks may not be applicable to non-European ancestry carriers.\n      PRS are now used in cancer risk\u2013stratified screening trials and implementation studies in the general population (43\u201347). They are commercially available and are used in multifactorial cancer-risk prediction models for women (48,49). We found that PRS derived from population-based data are associated with breast and prostate cancer risks and lead to meaningful risk stratification for male carriers. These findings may potentially be used to provide more personalized cancer risk predictions and therefore assist clinical management decisions. Future implementation studies should determine if optimal strategies exist for incorporating these PRS into genetic counseling and risk assessment to clarify whether they can influence the clinical management decisions of male BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers.\nFunding\n      The CIMBA data management and data analysis were supported by Cancer Research UK grants C12292/A20861 and PPRPGM-Nov20\\100002.
