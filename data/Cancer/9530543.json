A forest plot of the results of the sub\u2010group analyses of the ALI, LCR, and NLR in patients with lung cancer (Figure 4) showed that a low ALI, high LCR, and high NLR were risk factors for mortality in lung cancer patients who were younger or older than 65\u00a0years, men, women, non\u2010smokers, had NSCLC, obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a028\u00a0kg/m2), or TNM Stage III. Consistent with previous studies, our study found that PLR, ALI, NLR, SII, CAR, CONUT score, mGPS, GNRI, AGR, PNI, NRI, LCR, and CRP were all associated with OS in univariate analysis; each of these indicators except the PLR was an independent prognostic indicators of lung cancer patients and that GLR, mGNRI, and LCS, which were not examined in previous study, were also independent predictors of prognosis in patients with lung cancer.",

    "description": "Backgrounds\n          Malnutrition and systemic inflammatory responses are associated with poor overall survival (OS) in lung cancer patients, but it remains unclear which biomarkers are better for predicting their prognosis. This study tried to determine the best one among the existing common nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators of OS for patients with lung cancer.\nMaterials and methods\n          There were 16 nutrition or systemic inflammation\u2010based indicators included in this study. The cut\u2010off points for the indicators were calculated using maximally selected rank statistics. The OS was evaluated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the relationship between the indicators and OS. A time\u2010dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (time\u2010ROC) and C\u2010index were calculated to assess the predictive ability of the different indicators.\nResults\n      \n        Characteristics of the patients\n        A total of 1772 patients were included in the study. Of these, 791 (44.6%) had NSCLC, and 233 (13.1%) had SCLC; 748 (42.2%) patients with lung cancer did not have a clear pathological classification. The patient demographics are shown in Table\n1. In our population, the mean age was 60.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.46\u00a0years, and males were prevalent (n\u00a0=\u00a01134, 64.0%). Of all the patients, 60.7% were smokers. The prevalence of distant metastasis was high (51.7%). Of all patients in this study, 403 (22.7%) underwent surgery, and most patients were treated with chemotherapy (70.4%). Furthermore, the patients enrolled in the study had a poor nutritional status with a high PG\u2010SGA score (5.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.43).\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Baseline

inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators and OS in lung cancer patients\n        After nearly 8\u00a0years of follow\u2010up, 926 of the lung cancer patients had died; the median OS time was 26.1\u00a0months. In particular, the median OS times for SCLC and NSCLC were 22.2\u00a0months and 32.5\u00a0months, respectively. The cut\u2010off points of 16 inflammation and malnutrition\u2010based indicators were 3.36 (NLR), 206.96 (PLR), 5.27 (GLR), 705.03 (SII), 34.19 (ALI), 0.18 (CAR), 96.05 (GNRI), 43.83 (mGNRI), 1.24 (AGR), 48.60 (PNI), 97.17 (NRI), 2728.94 (LCR), and 9.02 (CRP). The non\u2010linear correlation between these nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators and the mortality of patients with lung cancer is shown in Figure\nS1. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the ALI, SII, NLR, PNI, GLR, CRP, LCR, LCS, CAR, AGR, GNRI, mGNRI, NRI, mGPS, and CONUT score, but not PLR, were independent risk factors for elevated mortality in patients with lung cancer (Table\n2).

Compared with the other inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators, the ALI showed the highest C\u2010index for OS in lung cancer patients at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years: 0.617 (95% CI, 0.589\u20130.646), 0.607 (95% CI, 0.586\u20130.629), and 0.611 (95% CI, 0.591\u20130.631), respectively (Table\n3). The ALI, LCR, and NLR were the Top 3 inflammation\u2010based indicators according to the 5\u2010year C\u2010index. Moreover, the ALI had a higher AUC value than the other inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators (Figure\n3). \nTable S2 shows that the ALI, LCR, and NLR significantly contributed to the prognostic value of the TNM classification system. In different sub\u2010groups, the ALI had the highest C\u2010index in men and women, smokers and non\u2010smokers, aged <65\u00a0years, and SCLC lung cancer patients, as compared with the other indicators (\nTables S3\u2013S6). In the sub\u2010group of lung cancer patients older than 65\u00a0years or had NSCLC, mGNRI had the highest C\u2010index (C\u2010index, 0.610 for age \u226565 and 0.639 for NSCLC) compared to the other indicators (\nTables S5 and S6).\n        \n          Table 3\n          \n            The C\u2010index of 16 indicators for OS in patients with lung cancer\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \nC\u2010index (95% CI)\n              \n              \n                Indicators\n                1\u2010year\n                3\u2010year\n                5\u2010year\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                ALI\n                0.617 (0.589,0.646)\n                0.607 (0.586,0.629)\n                0.611 (0.591,0.631)\n              \n              \n                LCR\n                0.577 (0.548,0.606)\n                0.590 (0.568,0.611)\n                0.604 (0.583,0.624)\n              \n              \n                NLR\n                0.612 (0.583,0.640)\n                0.598 (0.577,0.619)\n                0.597 (0.577,0.618)\n              \n              \n                mGNRI\n                0.564 (0.534,0.594)\n                0.575 (0.553,0.596)\n                0.597 (0.577,0.617)\n              \n              \n                CAR\n                0.557 (0.527,0.587)\n                0.577 (0.556,0.599)\n                0.596 (0.576,0.617)\n              \n              \n                PNI\n                0.580 (0.550,0.610)\n                0.588 (0.567,0.609)\n                0.593 (0.573,0.613)\n              \n              \n                NRI\n                0.556 (0.526,0.587)\n                0.573 (0.552,0.595)\n                0.592 (0.572,0.612)\n              \n              \n                GNRI\n                0.556 (0.526,0.587)\n                0.573 (0.552,0.595)\n                0.592 (0.572,0.612)\n              \n              \n                CRP\n                0.555 (0.526,0.585)\n                0.573 (0.551,0.595)\n                0.592 (0.571,0.612)\n              \n              \n                CONUT\n                0.589 (0.561,0.618)\n                0.592 (0.571,0.613)\n                0.586 (0.566,0.606)\n              \n              \n                SII\n                0.581 (0.552,0.610)\n                0.569 (0.548,0.590)\n                0.576 (0.556,0.596)\n              \n              \n                mGPS\n                0.556 (0.529,0.583)\n                0.565 (0.546,0.584)\n                0.575 (0.557,0.593)\n              \n              \n                GLR\n                0.600 (0.570,0.629)\n                0.586 (0.565,0.608)\n                0.569 (0.549,0.590)\n              \n              \n                AGR\n                0.525 (0.496,0.555)\n                0.546 (0.525,0.568)\n                0.567 (0.547,0.588)\n              \n              \n                LCS\n                0.542 (0.517,0.567)\n                0.539 (0.520,0.557)\n                0.553 (0.536,0.571)\n              \n              \n                PLR\n                0.567 (0.538,0.597)\n                0.546 (0.525,0.568)\n                0.545 (0.524,0.566)\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              AGR, albumin\u2010to\u2010globulin ratio; ALI, advanced lung cancer inflammation index; CAR, C\u2010reactive protein\u2010to\u2010albumin ratio; CONUT score, controlling nutritional status score; CRP, C\u2010reactive protein; GLR, glucose\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; GNRI, geriatric nutritional risk index; LCR, lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio; LCS, lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio score; mGNRI, modified geriatric nutritional risk index; mGPS, modified Glasgow prognostic score; NLR, neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; NRI, nutritional risk index; OS, overall survival; PLR, platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; PNI, prognostic nutritional index; SII, systemic immune\u2010inflammation index.\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            The time\u2010dependent ROC of inflammation and nutrition\u2010relative indicators for diagnosing overall survival in patients with lung cancer.

The baseline characteristics of the lung cancer patients stratified by high/low ALI, LCR, and NLR are shown in \nTables S7\u2013S9. A forest plot of the results of the sub\u2010group analyses of the ALI, LCR, and NLR in patients with lung cancer (Figure\n4) showed that a low ALI, high LCR, and high NLR were risk factors for mortality in lung cancer patients who were younger or older than 65\u00a0years, men, women, non\u2010smokers, had NSCLC, obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a028\u00a0kg/m2), or TNM Stage III. Interestingly, the smoking status (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.004), lung cancer types (P for interaction\u00a0<\u00a00.001) of the patients, and a high NLR had interactive effects. Moreover, patients with lung cancer had an increased NLR and decreased ALI and LCR along with the elevated TNM stage (\nFigure S3). \nFigures S4 and S5 showed the Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of the ALI, LCR, and NLR in different sub\u2010groups of lung cancer patients stratified by sex, smoking status, TNM stage, and pathological type. Patients with lung cancer with a low ALI, low LCR, or high NLR had poor OS, even in 30\u2010day outcome (Figure\n5).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            The sub\u2010group analysis of ALI, LCR, and NLR in patients with lung cancer.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer tumour node metastasis (TNM) classification and staging system has proven to be predictive of overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer, and a number of clinical indicators\n3\n such as smoking habit, gender, age, weight loss,\n4\n performance status,\n5\n and some inflammatory indicators\n6\n seem to be associated with the prognosis of lung cancer patients.\n      Recently, elevating evidences have shown that multiple nutrition/inflammation\u2010related factors can be used as effective prognostic predictors in lung cancer. The markers of the systemic inflammatory response, such as the plasma C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) levels\n7\n, platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (PLR),\n6\n and the neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR)\n8\n have been shown to play an important role in the progression and prognosis of patients with lung cancer. The prognostic significance of the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), which is calculated by multiplying the body mass index (BMI) by serum albumin/NLR, has been described in several studies that showed that low ALI is associated with an unfavourable prognosis in lung cancer.\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n A high systemic immune\u2010inflammation index (SII)\n12\n and CRP/albumin ratio (CAR)\n13\n are also biomarkers that predict poor prognosis in lung cancer. A low albumin\u2010to\u2010globulin ratio (AGR) is an independent risk factor for poor OS in non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small\u2010cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n14\n The Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), which consist of albumin and CRP levels, can also predict the OS of patients with lung cancer.\n15\n Moreover, nutrition\u2010based indicators such as the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI),\n16\n nutritional risk index (NRI),\n17\n and prognostic nutritional index (PNI)\n18\n have been shown to be prognostic factors for predicting outcomes in patients with lung cancer. In addition, the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score is a novel prognostic parameter for various cancers, including lung cancer.\n19\n The baseline glucose\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (GLR) is an independent prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer\n20\n and gallbladder cancer.\n21\n The lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010CRP ratio (LCR), lymphocyte CRP score (LCS),\n22\n, \n23\n and modified GNRI (mGNRI) are useful prognostic biomarkers for several types of cancer in recent studies.\n24\n However, the prognostic significance of the GLR, mGNRI, and LCS in lung cancer remains unknown.\n      Although studies have confirmed that some of the aforementioned nutrition/inflammation\u2010related indicators have value for predicting the survival of lung cancer patients, it is necessary to confirm which indicators are the best prognosis predictors for lung cancer patients. In this study, we evaluated and compared the predictive and the prognostic roles of 16 biomarkers of malnutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators on the OS of patients with lung cancer. We also assessed which indicator was the unique among different sub\u2010groups.\nMaterial and methods\n      \n        Participants\n        All patients were recruited from the Investigation on Nutrition Status and its Clinical Outcome of Common Cancers (INSCOC) project, which recruited participants from multiple clinical centres across China from 2013. The trial is registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn under the registration number ChiCTR1800020329. Data were prospectively collected from multiple centres across China. The design, methods and development of the INSCOC study were performed as described previously.\n25\n All patients who had missing records for age, height, serum globulin levels, fasting blood glucose data, neutrophil counts, platelet counts, serum albumin levels, CRP levels, cholesterol concentration, or lymphocyte counts were excluded from the study. Patients without lung cancer were also excluded from the study. A total of 1772 patients with lung cancer were selected for this study. A flow chart of the participant selection is shown in Figure\n1. All selected patients signed informed consent forms prior to the study initiation within 48\u00a0h of hospital admission. Patients who could not communicate and/or were unable to provide verbal consent were excluded from the study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review committee of Beijing Shijitan Hospital.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            The flow chart.\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Baseline data collection\n        The baseline information of the patients included age, sex, complications, smoking status, the family history of tumours, the pathological type of lung cancer, and alcohol consumption. A dietitian or clinician conducted a comprehensive interview with each patient to acquire recent preoperative nutritional information, including the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 score, Patient\u2010Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG\u2010SGA) score, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and anthropometric measurements including height, body weight, and handgrip strength. The tumour stage of solid tumours was evaluated based on the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system.\n      \n      \n        Measurements of nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicator in routine blood tests\n        Routine blood examinations were obtained after at least 9\u00a0h of fasting, within 24\u00a0h of hospitalization, and included the levels of albumin, glucose, globulin, haemoglobin, C\u2010reaction protein (CRP) and total cholesterol, and lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts. The 16 nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators used in this study included the ALI, SII, PLR, NLR, PNI, GLR, LCR AGR, GNRI, mGNRI, NRI, mGPS, LCS, and CONUT score. The definition of the LCS, CONUT scores, and mGPS were determined based on previous reports. The calculation methods for the combination of each nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicator are shown in Table\nS1.\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21 software (SPSS, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and R Version 4.0.2, including the R packages \u2018survminer\u2019, \u2018survival\u2019, \u2018rms\u2019, \u2018ggplot2\u2019, \u2018forestplot\u2019, \u2018timeROC\u2019, and \u2018maxstat\u2019. Variables are expressed as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation, as median (interquartile range), or in absolute number and proportion as appropriate (continuous or categorical variables). The differences between the groups were evaluated using the Mann\u2013Whitney test (for continuous variables that were not normally distributed), and the chi\u2010square test (for categorical variables). We dichotomized the continuous nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators based on the optimal cut\u2010off points calculated using maximally selected rank statistics. The OS was evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and analysed using the two\u2010sided log\u2010rank test. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the relationship between the nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators and OS in patients with lung cancer. The predictive accuracy of each indicator was assessed using the C\u2010index and time\u2010dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (time\u2010ROC). To determine whether the same indicator was applicable across the sub\u2010groups, and to gain insight into the most useful biomarker in the different sub\u2010groups, we carried out a sub\u2010group analysis of age, sex, lung cancer types, and smoking status in patients with lung cancer. Two\u2010sided P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistical significance.\nParticipants\n        All patients were recruited from the Investigation on Nutrition Status and its Clinical Outcome of Common Cancers (INSCOC) project, which recruited participants from multiple clinical centres across China from 2013.

Two\u2010sided P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistical significance.\nCharacteristics of the patients\n        A total of 1772 patients were included in the study. Of these, 791 (44.6%) had NSCLC, and 233 (13.1%) had SCLC; 748 (42.2%) patients with lung cancer did not have a clear pathological classification. The patient demographics are shown in Table\n1. In our population, the mean age was 60.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.46\u00a0years, and males were prevalent (n\u00a0=\u00a01134, 64.0%). Of all the patients, 60.7% were smokers. The prevalence of distant metastasis was high (51.7%). Of all patients in this study, 403 (22.7%) underwent surgery, and most patients were treated with chemotherapy (70.4%). Furthermore, the patients enrolled in the study had a poor nutritional status with a high PG\u2010SGA score (5.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.43).\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Baseline

nearly 8\u00a0years of follow\u2010up, 926 of the lung cancer patients had died; the median OS time was 26.1\u00a0months. In particular, the median OS times for SCLC and NSCLC were 22.2\u00a0months and 32.5\u00a0months, respectively. The cut\u2010off points of 16 inflammation and malnutrition\u2010based indicators were 3.36 (NLR), 206.96 (PLR), 5.27 (GLR), 705.03 (SII), 34.19 (ALI), 0.18 (CAR), 96.05 (GNRI), 43.83 (mGNRI), 1.24 (AGR), 48.60 (PNI), 97.17 (NRI), 2728.94 (LCR), and 9.02 (CRP). The non\u2010linear correlation between these nutrition/inflammation\u2010based indicators and the mortality of patients with lung cancer is shown in Figure\nS1. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the ALI, SII, NLR, PNI, GLR, CRP, LCR, LCS, CAR, AGR, GNRI, mGNRI, NRI, mGPS, and CONUT score, but not PLR, were independent risk factors for elevated mortality in patients with lung cancer (Table\n2). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed that lung cancer patients with malnutrition and inflammation had a more unfavourable OS than those without malnutrition or inflammation (Figures\n2 and S2).\n        \n

Compared with the other inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators, the ALI showed the highest C\u2010index for OS in lung cancer patients at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years: 0.617 (95% CI, 0.589\u20130.646), 0.607 (95% CI, 0.586\u20130.629), and 0.611 (95% CI, 0.591\u20130.631), respectively (Table\n3). The ALI, LCR, and NLR were the Top 3 inflammation\u2010based indicators according to the 5\u2010year C\u2010index. Moreover, the ALI had a higher AUC value than the other inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators (Figure\n3). \nTable S2 shows that the ALI, LCR, and NLR significantly contributed to the prognostic value of the TNM classification system. In different sub\u2010groups, the ALI had the highest C\u2010index in men and women, smokers and non\u2010smokers, aged <65\u00a0years, and SCLC lung cancer patients, as compared with the other indicators (\nTables S3\u2013S6). In the sub\u2010group of lung cancer patients older than 65\u00a0years or had NSCLC, mGNRI had the highest C\u2010index (C\u2010index, 0.610 for age \u226565 and 0.639 for NSCLC) compared to the other indicators (\nTables S5 and S6).\n        \n          Table 3\n          \n            The C\u2010index of 16 indicators for OS in patients with lung cancer\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \nC\u2010index (95% CI)\n              \n              \n                Indicators\n                1\u2010year\n                3\u2010year\n                5\u2010year\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                ALI\n                0.617 (0.589,0.646)\n                0.607 (0.586,0.629)\n                0.611 (0.591,0.631)\n              \n              \n                LCR\n                0.577 (0.548,0.606)\n                0.590 (0.568,0.611)\n                0.604 (0.583,0.624)\n              \n              \n                NLR\n                0.612 (0.583,0.640)\n                0.598 (0.577,0.619)\n                0.597 (0.577,0.618)\n              \n              \n                mGNRI\n                0.564 (0.534,0.594)\n                0.575 (0.553,0.596)\n                0.597 (0.577,0.617)\n              \n              \n                CAR\n                0.557 (0.527,0.587)\n                0.577 (0.556,0.599)\n                0.596 (0.576,0.617)\n              \n              \n                PNI\n                0.580 (0.550,0.610)\n                0.588 (0.567,0.609)\n                0.593 (0.573,0.613)\n              \n              \n                NRI\n                0.556 (0.526,0.587)\n                0.573 (0.552,0.595)\n                0.592 (0.572,0.612)\n              \n              \n                GNRI\n                0.556 (0.526,0.587)\n                0.573 (0.552,0.595)\n                0.592 (0.572,0.612)\n              \n              \n                CRP\n                0.555 (0.526,0.585)\n                0.573 (0.551,0.595)\n                0.592 (0.571,0.612)\n              \n              \n                CONUT\n                0.589 (0.561,0.618)\n                0.592 (0.571,0.613)\n                0.586 (0.566,0.606)\n              \n              \n                SII\n                0.581 (0.552,0.610)\n                0.569 (0.548,0.590)\n                0.576 (0.556,0.596)\n              \n              \n                mGPS\n                0.556 (0.529,0.583)\n                0.565 (0.546,0.584)\n                0.575 (0.557,0.593)\n              \n              \n                GLR\n                0.600 (0.570,0.629)\n                0.586 (0.565,0.608)\n                0.569 (0.549,0.590)\n              \n              \n                AGR\n                0.525 (0.496,0.555)\n                0.546 (0.525,0.568)\n                0.567 (0.547,0.588)\n              \n              \n                LCS\n                0.542 (0.517,0.567)\n                0.539 (0.520,0.557)\n                0.553 (0.536,0.571)\n              \n              \n                PLR\n                0.567 (0.538,0.597)\n                0.546 (0.525,0.568)\n                0.545 (0.524,0.566)\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              AGR, albumin\u2010to\u2010globulin ratio; ALI, advanced lung cancer inflammation index; CAR, C\u2010reactive protein\u2010to\u2010albumin ratio; CONUT score, controlling nutritional status score; CRP, C\u2010reactive protein; GLR, glucose\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; GNRI, geriatric nutritional risk index; LCR, lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio; LCS, lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio score; mGNRI, modified geriatric nutritional risk index; mGPS, modified Glasgow prognostic score; NLR, neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; NRI, nutritional risk index; OS, overall survival; PLR, platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; PNI, prognostic nutritional index; SII, systemic immune\u2010inflammation index.\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            The time\u2010dependent ROC of inflammation and nutrition\u2010relative indicators for diagnosing overall survival in patients with lung cancer.

The baseline characteristics of the lung cancer patients stratified by high/low ALI, LCR, and NLR are shown in \nTables S7\u2013S9. A forest plot of the results of the sub\u2010group analyses of the ALI, LCR, and NLR in patients with lung cancer (Figure\n4) showed that a low ALI, high LCR, and high NLR were risk factors for mortality in lung cancer patients who were younger or older than 65\u00a0years, men, women, non\u2010smokers, had NSCLC, obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a028\u00a0kg/m2), or TNM Stage III. Interestingly, the smoking status (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.004), lung cancer types (P for interaction\u00a0<\u00a00.001) of the patients, and a high NLR had interactive effects. Moreover, patients with lung cancer had an increased NLR and decreased ALI and LCR along with the elevated TNM stage (\nFigure S3). \nFigures S4 and S5 showed the Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of the ALI, LCR, and NLR in different sub\u2010groups of lung cancer patients stratified by sex, smoking status, TNM stage, and pathological type. Patients with lung cancer with a low ALI, low LCR, or high NLR had poor OS, even in 30\u2010day outcome (Figure\n5).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            The sub\u2010group analysis of ALI, LCR, and NLR in patients with lung cancer.

Our study used a large cohort to assessed and compared 16 inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators and found that the ALI was stably and consistently discriminative in risk stratification across most sub\u2010groups of lung cancer patients. In addition, we found that the mGNRI was the preferable indicator in the sub\u2010groups of patients with lung cancer who were aged \u226565\u00a0years or had NSCLC. Among patients with SCLC, the GLR was a better prognostic predictor than the other indicators.\n      Previous studies reported that LCR,\n26\n ALI, NLR, PLR,\n6\n SII,\n27\n CAR,\n28\n mGPS,\n29\n CONUT score,\n30\n AGR,\n14\n PNI,\n31\n NRI, GNRI,\n32\n and CRP\n7\n were useful as predictors of the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Consistent with previous studies, our study found that PLR, ALI, NLR, SII, CAR, CONUT score, mGPS, GNRI, AGR, PNI, NRI, LCR, and CRP were all associated with OS in univariate analysis; each of these indicators except the PLR was an independent prognostic indicators of lung cancer patients and that GLR, mGNRI, and LCS, which were not examined in previous study, were also independent predictors of prognosis in patients with lung cancer. One study reported that the NLR, PLR, and ALI were associated with the OS of patients with lung cancer\n6\n; however, the comparisons of these three indicators were not performed in lung cancer patients in their study. A recent study reported that CAR has a stronger effect on prediction of a postoperative poor prognosis for NSCLC patients than GPS and mGPS.\n33\n Our study also identified that CAR and mGPS were independent prognostic biomarkers in lung cancer patients; however, the prediction effect of ALI on the poor prognosis for lung cancer was better than CAR among 16 inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators. In our study, the ALI displayed the best predictive performance for prognosis in patients with lung cancer among the inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators. ALI is an objective, easy\u2010to\u2010use, and simplified approach for facilitating the timely identification of lung cancer patients in clinical practice. The results need to be confirmed by more prospective studies.\n      The ALI was developed initially for assessing the degree of systemic inflammation at the time of diagnosis in patients with metastatic NSCLC. The ALI is a composite index derived from three factors: BMI, serum albumin levels, and NLR. The BMI, albumin levels, and NLR are, respectively, anthropometric indicator, nutrition\u2010related, and inflammation\u2010related indicators. An independent protective association was observed between obesity and lung cancer\u2010related mortality.\n34\n The serum albumin level and NLR are also important prognostic factors for OS in patients with lung cancer.\n35\n Compared with the other indicators, the ALI is the only indicator that covers anthropometric, nutritional, and inflammatory factors associated with the prognosis of lung cancer. This may be one reason why the ALI had a better predictive performance in the prognosis of lung cancer than the other indicators.\n      Bouillanne et al. reported that the mGNRI was a possible predictor of prognosis in elderly patients with heart failure; several studies have reported that the mGNRI is also a useful predictor of prognosis in malignancies.\n24\n We found that the mGNRI was a useful independent prognostic factor in patients with lung cancer, and it had the best predictive significance in the prognosis of lung cancer patients over 65\u00a0years of age. In addition, the mGNRI had the highest C\u2010index in patients with NSCLC; the GLR performed the best in patients with SCLC. Because nearly half of the patients failed to undergo pathological classification, this may not be representative and needs to be verified in a large\u2010population study. Although the mGNRI and GLR had the highest C\u2010index for three sub\u2010groups, the ALI had the best predictive significance in the prognosis of lung cancer in general. These biomarkers, the ALI, mGNRI, and GLR represent convenient and inexpensive indicators that can be used to evaluate the status of systemic inflammation or nutrition. These inflammation/nutrition\u2010based indicators may allow for the early stratification of patients with lung cancer to optimize treatment.\n      Previous study has reported that high NLR is also a risk factor of mortality in patients with lung cancer in a low\u2010risk population, such as never\u2010smokers.\n36\n It is estimated that approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases are observed in never\u2010smokers.\n37\n In our study, 39.3% of lung cancer were non\u2010smokers. In fact, these lung cancer patients in non\u2010smokers are considered as a special disease with various different tumorigenic mode, clinico\u2010pathology, and natural history and is the seventh leading cause of cancer\u2010related deaths.\n38\n Intriguingly, our study observed an interactive effect between high NLR and smoking status in lung cancer patients, indicating that those lung cancer patients in non\u2010smokers with high NLR had higher risk of mortality. In our study, the NLR level had no significant difference in different sex and smoking status (data were not shown). However, female patients in those lung cancer patients with high NLR in non\u2010smokers had 64% level count (\nTable S10). Previous studies showed that female lung cancer in non\u2010smokers had more gene mutations\n39\n and tend to be affected by second\u2010hand smoke.\n40\n Second\u2010hand smoke is one of the mortality risks of lung cancer patients in non\u2010smokers.\n37\n Our study indicated that inflammation may be another risk factor of the mortality in non\u2010smoker lung cancer patients. However, the underlying mechanism needs to be identified in further study. In addition, we also found that the NLR and pathologic type of lung cancer had a significant interactive effect. Those patients with NSCLC combined with high NLR had a higher risk of mortality. The different pathology types of lung cancer may lead to the different sensitivity or mechanism of inflammation, resulting in different degrees of mortality risk.\n      This study had several limitations. First, the pathological classification data of some patients with lung cancer were not determined, and the results for different lung cancer sub\u2010groups need to be further verified. Second, the limitation of relevant data on the targeted therapy and immunotherapy and the use of anti\u2010inflammatory drugs in this study may have affected the results. However, this study cannot exclude the influence of this factor on the results, which should be verified in more rigorous cohort studies in the future. Third, this study lacked continuous data. If there were dynamic changes in the indicators before or after the intervention, the results might be more convincing; whether survival outcomes are improved after the corresponding intervention needs to be verified by future studies.\n      In conclusion, compared with the other indicators, the ALI showed the best performance in predicting the prognosis of patients with lung cancer in general and in most sub\u2010groups. The evaluation of the ALI could identify lung cancer patients at risk of a poor prognosis and be a useful prognostic marker in clinical practice.\nFunding\n      This work was financially supported by National Key Research and Development Program (No. 2017YFC1309200) and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (SCW2018\u201006) to Dr Hanping Shi and General Surgery Clinical Medical Center of Yunnan Province (No. ZX20190303) to Dr Kunhua Wang.\nConflict of interest\n      None.\nSupporting information\n      \n        \n          \nFigure S1.
