    "abstract": "IBC accounts for only 2%\u20134% of all breast cancer cases; however, the disease is responsible for 10% of breast cancer\u2010related deaths in the US.1 In a comparative study with non\u2010inflammatory locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients, women diagnosed with IBC had a significantly poorer survival time (2.9\u00a0years vs. 6.4\u00a0years) over 10\u00a0years.2 IBC is a clinical diagnosis, requiring >1/3 involvement on the affected breast and/or skin by erythema, and disease onset of <6\u00a0months.3, 4, 5 Diagnostic ambiguity can occur in cases that present with borderline features, or overt skin change that is not readily apparent as erythema. It is increasingly recognized that not all skin change is overtly erythematous in IBC.6 Marked swelling of the involved breast is often noted at the time of diagnosis and nipple changes (flattening or inversion) is a common finding among IBC cases.4, 7, 8, 9 While it has been well\u2010demonstrated that frank peau d'orange and other skin changes are prognostic for worse outcome in all patients, very little is known about the prognostic effect of variations in skin change on IBC presentation.10, 11, 12 For over 10\u00a0years in a dedicated IBC multi\u2010disciplinary clinic, we increasingly associate the clinical signs triad of diffuse skin change (not solely limited to erythema), obvious swelling of the involved breast and nipple change, with an unambiguous diagnosis of IBC if the onset of the disease is rapidly occurring in <6\u00a0months. In an initiative to improve IBC patient clinical diagnosis and further outcome, several groups including Susan G. Komen, the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and the Milburn Foundation convened patient advocates and breast cancer researchers, clinicians, and experts to improve and progress IBC diagnostics beyond clinical subjectivity.4 This was achieved by establishing detailed criteria and scoring systems to facilitate IBC diagnosis and subsequently patient care.",

    "description": "Background\n          Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a clinical diagnosis. Here, we examined the association of a \u201cclassic\u201d triad of clinical signs, swollen involved breast, nipple change, and diffuse skin change, with overall survival (OS).\nMethod\n          Breast medical photographs from patients enrolled on a prospective IBC registry were scored by two independent reviewers as classic (triad above), not classic, and difficult to assign. Chi\u2010squared test, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test were used to assess differences between patient groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates and the log\u2010rank test and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to assess the OS.\n3\n      RESULTS\n      \n        3.1\n        Study participants\n        From 2007 to 2020, a total of 701 patients were enrolled in the prospective IBC registry of which 423 (60.3%) were enrolled prior to beginning any therapy. Medical photographs were available on 250 patients (59%). Images were scored for presentation (classic N\u00a0=\u00a060, not classic N\u00a0=\u00a0130 or difficult to assign N\u00a0=\u00a052). Five patients lacking outcomes or without a contralateral breast or photograph of the contralateral breast for comparison to assess the scoring were excluded leaving 245 patients in this analysis.\n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Demographic and clinical characteristics of our patient population\n        Table\u00a01 describes the demographic and reproductive factors of the study participants.

One hundred and twelve (59.6%) parous women reported a history of breastfeeding. Based on a subset (N\u00a0=\u00a027) of patients that responded to a set of questions regarding breastfeeding history that were introduced more recently to the questionnaire, two patients breastfed for <1\u00a0month (7.4%), four for 1\u20133\u00a0months (14.8%), four for >3\u2013<6\u00a0months (14.8%), and 17 for >6\u00a0months (63%). The majority of the patients were post\u2010menopausal (67.5% vs. 32.5%). Never smokers accounted for 57.8% of the patients, while 33.3% were former smokers and 8.8% were current smokers.\n        Table\u00a02\u00a0shows the tumor and clinical characteristics, the distribution of clinical stage across the cohort were IIIB (32%), IIIC (32%), and stage IV (36%).

Further work is warranted to understand the biology related to clinical signs and further extend the understanding of physical examination findings in IBC.\n1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and particularly aggressive variant of breast cancer. IBC accounts for only 2%\u20134% of all breast cancer cases; however, the disease is responsible for 10% of breast cancer\u2010related deaths in the US.1 In a comparative study with non\u2010inflammatory locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients, women diagnosed with IBC had a significantly poorer survival time (2.9\u00a0years vs. 6.4\u00a0years) over 10\u00a0years.2 IBC is a clinical diagnosis, requiring >1/3 involvement on the affected breast and/or skin by erythema, and disease onset of <6\u00a0months.3, 4, 5 Diagnostic ambiguity can occur in cases that present with borderline features, or overt skin change that is not readily apparent as erythema. To date, no study has examined the association between outcome and clinical findings regarding breast appearance.\n      It is increasingly recognized that not all skin change is overtly erythematous in IBC.6 Marked swelling of the involved breast is often noted at the time of diagnosis and nipple changes (flattening or inversion) is a common finding among IBC cases.4, 7, 8, 9 While it has been well\u2010demonstrated that frank peau d'orange and other skin changes are prognostic for worse outcome in all patients, very little is known about the prognostic effect of variations in skin change on IBC presentation.10, 11, 12 For over 10\u00a0years in a dedicated IBC multi\u2010disciplinary clinic, we increasingly associate the clinical signs triad of diffuse skin change (not solely limited to erythema), obvious swelling of the involved breast and nipple change, with an unambiguous diagnosis of IBC if the onset of the disease is rapidly occurring in <6\u00a0months. Here we sought to review pre\u2010treatment medical photographs from IBC patients to determine whether this triad of breast signs was associated with poorer outcome than cases that met diagnostic criteria.\n2\n      METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Study cohort\n        Since 2007, all patients evaluated and diagnosed with IBC using international consensus guidelines for IBC5 and seen at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Morgan Welch IBC Clinic have been offered participation in an IRB\u2010approved prospective registry.9 The international IBC diagnosis consensus guidelines note diagnostic minimal criteria include rapid onset of erythema, edema, peau d'orange, and/or breast warmth. Thus, patients were diagnosed with IBC who have obvious skin changes over at least 1/3 of the breast without erythema. For some women, skin discoloration from baseline is darkening or purplish rather than red/erythema. For some women, skin edema >1/3 of the breast (either frank peau d'orange skin change or more subtle edema only visible on close inspection) may be evident without any redness or discoloration (Figure\u00a01). Examination of the registry database specifically demonstrates erythema is less common among African American women.6 Participation in the registry included completing an interviewer\u2010administered questionnaire to collect risk factor information such as demographics, lifestyle, reproductive, and family history. All patients underwent multi\u2010disciplinary evaluations that included assessment by a breast medical oncologist, breast surgeon, breast radiation oncologist, and breast radiologist. Routine imaging included bilateral mammogram, bilateral ultrasound, and staging (CT chest abdomen and pelvis with bone scan or PET/CT).13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 MD Anderson breast pathologists reviewed patient biopsies and specimens, and recommendations from the American Society for Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists were used to determine the 1% nuclear expression cutoff for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression.19\n\n        \n          FIGURE 1\n          \n            Examples IBC patient photographs scored by clinical presentation (A). Representative photo scored as non\u2010classic as breast shows diffuse erythema of a fairly symmetrical possibly slightly retracted left breast (B). Representative classic patient demonstrating significant swelling of the affected right breast, flattened nipple, and diffuse change in skin tone\n          \n          \n        \n        For this analysis, we reviewed pre\u2010treatment medical photographs and charts of patients from the IBC registry. Breast medical photographs at the time of diagnosis are an essential component of disease evaluation, since the images serve to inform and guide radiation treatments and assessment of treatment response. All the available breast medical photographs were reviewed by two independent non\u2010IBC experts, a non\u2010oncological physician, and a graduate student. Scoring discrepancies were resolved by a high\u2010volume IBC clinician. Photographs with evident ipsilateral breast swelling, diffuse skin change (not limited to erythema but in all cases encompassing all or nearly all of the breast), and nipple change (all compared to the uninvolved side) were scored as positive for the triad of signs deemed classic (Figure\u00a01B). Those without all three signs were scored as non\u2010classic and ambiguous or difficult to assign cases were scored as a third group (Figure\u00a01A). This group included patients with two overt signs but not the third, such as evident diffuse skin change but retraction of the breast rather than swelling, or borderline calls for any one sign.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Statistical methods\n        Descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, and range for continuous variables, and tabulation for categorical variables were used to present patient demographic and clinical/pathological characteristics. To compare differences between or among the patient groups, the Chi\u2010squared test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for continuous measures. IBC diagnosis dates were used to measure overall survival (OS) times. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to estimate OS distributions and the log\u2010rank test to assess differences in OS between or among patient groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the presentation and the effect of other important covariates on OS. All computations are carried out in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) and Splus 8.2 (TIBCO Software Inc).\n2.1\n        Study cohort\n        Since 2007, all patients evaluated and diagnosed with IBC using international consensus guidelines for IBC5 and seen at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Morgan Welch IBC Clinic have been offered participation in an IRB\u2010approved prospective registry.9 The international IBC diagnosis consensus guidelines note diagnostic minimal criteria include rapid onset of erythema, edema, peau d'orange, and/or breast warmth.

Medical photographs were available on 250 patients (59%). Images were scored for presentation (classic N\u00a0=\u00a060, not classic N\u00a0=\u00a0130 or difficult to assign N\u00a0=\u00a052). Five patients lacking outcomes or without a contralateral breast or photograph of the contralateral breast for comparison to assess the scoring were excluded leaving 245 patients in this analysis.\n3.2\n        Demographic and clinical characteristics of our patient population\n        Table\u00a01 describes the demographic and reproductive factors of the study participants.

One hundred and twelve (59.6%) parous women reported a history of breastfeeding. Based on a subset (N\u00a0=\u00a027) of patients that responded to a set of questions regarding breastfeeding history that were introduced more recently to the questionnaire, two patients breastfed for <1\u00a0month (7.4%), four for 1\u20133\u00a0months (14.8%), four for >3\u2013<6\u00a0months (14.8%), and 17 for >6\u00a0months (63%). The majority of the patients were post\u2010menopausal (67.5% vs. 32.5%).

Among M0 patients 93% received neoadjuvant and 26.1% received adjuvant chemotherapy. Further, 82.5% of M0 received documented adjuvant radiation therapy. The median follow\u2010up period was 6\u00a0years.

Ten\u2010year actuarial OS for the classic group was 29.7 versus 57.2% for all others (Figure\u00a02B, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

Overt cases are characterized by diffuse erythema, edema (peau d'orange), breast enlargement, or other skin involvement as well as skin color changes21, 22, 23; however, significant variation at presentation leads to ambiguity in those diagnosed with IBC. We examined whether a visible constellation of clinical breast signs deemed \u201cclassic\u201d by a high\u2010volume IBC clinic correlated with OS, and observed for the first time advanced stage and poorer outcome among the classic presenting patients compared to all others. Our study further demonstrates the extent of variation in presentation and warrants the need to further refine diagnostics for the ambiguous or less overt presenting cases.\n      The scoring criteria for classic IBC in this study were based on experience in our dedicated single institution IBC clinic and in part confirmed by a recent working group to refine diagnostic IBC symptoms. In an initiative to improve IBC patient clinical diagnosis and further outcome, several groups including Susan G. Komen, the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and the Milburn Foundation convened patient advocates and breast cancer researchers, clinicians, and experts to improve and progress IBC diagnostics beyond clinical subjectivity.4 This was achieved by establishing detailed criteria and scoring systems to facilitate IBC diagnosis and subsequently patient care. The proposed scoring system based on the experience of the involved experts and literature review included variables such as the timing of initial signs/symptoms to diagnosis, skin changes including any peau d'orange or skin edema/thickening involving over a third of the breast, breast swelling supplemented by skin discoloration (darkening, purplish or bruising appearance), and nipple abnormalities such as nipple inversion or new nipple flattening or asymmetry. The detailed scoring system established through the Komen initiative accounted for the heterogeneity in characteristics commonly associated with IBC, thus broadening the scope of the IBC clinical subjectivity. Importantly, focusing on skin change as classic criteria as opposed to skin erythema, would potentially reduce inaccurate exclusion of black women who may go underdiagnosed due to presentation bias attributed to skin change not being explicitly red.24, 25, 26, 27, 28 In addition, this more intricate and detailed disease classification could help develop a staging system specific to IBC.\n      Though similarities may surface, there are clinical practices that distinguish skin changes seen with IBC from the skin changes associated with non\u2010inflammatory breast tumors (T4a\u2010c).23, 29, 30 Variability in features and characterizations observed in presentation among IBC patients were observed in our patient cohort. Only 24.8% had classic appearing IBC by these criteria, highlighting the majority of cases take some further diagnostic work to make the diagnosis. Interestingly, as has been described previously, many women don't describe erythema on presentation.4, 5 Since erythema is a part of the AJCC staging for T4D, it could be argued that these patients are misdiagnosed; however, in the presence of overt skin change such as diffuse peau d\u2010orange, it is felt instead that the staging imperfectly describes some IBC patients.\n      Additionally, we examined the impact of clinical, epidemiologic, and reproductive factors on the visual presentation scoring of classic among IBC patients. Reproductive factors were explored in more detail in a subset of patients that completed more extensive questionnaires. Interestingly, smoking was significantly increased among patients with classic presentation. Atkinson et al, previously reported in a single\u2010institution case\u2010control study, that epidemiological risk factors such as obesity and smoking were associated with IBC.31 A recent study evaluated the effect of demographic and lifestyle factors as well as the presence of crown\u2010like structures in breast adipose tissue (CLS\u2010B) on breast cancer outcome in African American versus white women.32 CLS\u2010Bs which are composed of adipocytes encircled by macrophages are associated with obesity as higher BMIs result in increased adipose tissue in the breast, which recruit macrophages creating a pro\u2010inflammatory microenvironment. This study concluded that current smoking was positively associated with the detection of CLS\u2010B, and at a higher density in comparison to non\u2010smoking individuals.32 This association with CLS\u2010B could explain how BMI and smoking induce changes in the breast microenvironment promoting a more classic IBC presentation.\n      Inflammatory breast cancer is highly lymphotactic, dilated dermal lymph vessels containing large tumor emboli are pathologic hallmarks histologically,33, 34 and are the underlying mechanism for the peau d'orange skin feature of IBC. In a comprehensive comparative study between IBC and non\u2010IBC, peritumoral lymph vessels in tumor specimens of IBC patients had higher proliferating lymphatic endothelial cells compared to non\u2010IBC tumors.35 These distinguishable features are critical in differentiating IBC and non\u2010IBC.36, 37 Interestingly, lymphovascular skin invasion (LVSI) on pathology report from the tumor showed no correlation with classic presentation.\n      Some limitations to this study include the pros and cons of the background of photo scorers, one non\u2010IBC expert physician, and one IBC research trainee without clinical experience. As non\u2010experts, the review reflects results expected from non\u2010experts which strengthen the utility of these findings beyond an expert clinic. However, some nuances may be overlooked or incorrectly attributed by non\u2010experts. Discrepancy review highlighted the impact of uncommon clinical findings such as non\u2010healing biopsies, prior surgical scars, or changes related to prior breast therapy. In addition, based on a prior hypothesis, this analysis does not explore the outcomes of patients with obvious skin findings and breast retraction which may represent distinct biology and deserves further study. Although the study data were collected prospectively, this review was retrospective which has inherent biases that may not be accounted for. Another limitation was the non\u2010representative racial distribution among the women in our patient cohort. Disparities in breast cancer screenings and treatment impact Black and Hispanic women. Black women are disproportionately impacted by IBC and are more likely to be diagnosed with triple negative\u2010IBC and a worse outcome than any other racial group.33, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 Underrepresentation of black women in our cohort precludes analysis of classic presentation by race; no significant associations were observed in our analysis, however, this limitation makes it inconclusive.\n      In conclusion, we show that a triad \u201cclassic\u201d IBC breast signs is independently prognostic for OS. While classic IBC presentation is associated with worse OS, the majority of the IBC patients in our study did not fall into the \u201cclassic\u201d group, and thus defining diagnostic criteria for those non\u2010classic patients who risk misdiagnosis or not receiving required treatments is critical. Future molecular studies comparing IBC tissues by presentation may help to shed light on the underlying biological mechanisms for IBC presentation and potential targets.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n      WB, WW, BO, KM: study design and inception.
