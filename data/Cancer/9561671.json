    "title": "Risk Factors of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Lung Cancer\nBefore Surgery: A Case Control Study",
    "abstract": "Occurrence of VTE in cancer patients has been proved to increase the likelihood of death by two-to six-fold, VTE has become the second leading cause of death in cancer patients.6,7 Besides, costs of patients with VTE associated with hospitalization is 2.5-fold higher, which contributes a substantial economic burden to the family.8,9 Many studies have showed that the prevalence of VTE is increased significantly among lung cancer patients, and It has been reported that patients with lung cancer are more likely to develop thrombotic events than other cancer patients, with an incidence of 13.9%.10,11 VTE can appear before cancer diagnosis, and before the begin of lung cancer treatment, the related mechanism may be that patients are in a hypercoagulable state.12 One study reported that among 231 cases of lung cancer patients before surgery, the incidence of VTE on admission was 5.2% (12/231).13 Except cancer-related factors, patient-related factors such as advanced age, race and a priority history of a thrombotic event, and treatment-related factors also contribute to developing VTE in admitted patients with lung cancer.10 Therefore, recognizing the risk factors of VTE in patients with lung cancer before surgery has become an important task to prevent and intervene in the occurrence of VTE. In the normal population, the risk of VTE increases with age, but the association between age and VTE in lung cancer patients is controversial.15 Lee YG et al conducted a retrospective analysis of 1998 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and found that advanced age was an independent predictor of VTE development, which is consistent with the conclusion of this study.16 While one research among 91933 patients with newly diagnosed with lung malignancy revealed that younger age (<45 years old) was a significant predictor of developing VTE within one year of non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis.17 The reason for this inconsistency may be related to the differences of study subjects, tumor biological characteristics. However, the level of D-dimer would also be elevated in condition of infections, heart failure, tumors, myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease.23 Thus, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline of cancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease recommends that further validation of D-dimer testing and clinical prediction models is warranted before these strategies are incorporated into the diagnosis of VTE in cancer patients.24 FIB is an acute reactive protein synthesized and secreted by liver cells, which is involved in the endogenous hemostatic process of the body.25 FIB is also known as coagulation factor \u2160, and the increase of its level indicates that the body is in a state of hypercoagulation, which is easy to induce the formation of thrombus.26,27 What mentioning above is consistent with the results of this study, which showed that FIB >4\u00a0g/L is associated with higher risk of VTE development in admitted patients with lung cancer.",

Patients diagnosed with lung cancer and prescribed\nto have an operation for curative treatment were included. Besides, all cases\nincluded were preoperative patients with the diagnosis of a DVT or a PE at\nadmission. Patients with stage IV disease or history of other malignancy were\nexcluded. The diagnosis of DVT was ascertained based on color Doppler\nultrasonography or a computerized tomography (CT) venous angiogram and a PE\nevent was confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT.\n      \n      \n        Data Collection\n        As cases of VTE were identified retrospectively, we searched the hospital VTE\nadverse events reporting system, which would record the occurrence of a VTE, in\norder to avoid the potential loss of some cases. Each VTE patient was randomly\nmatched to two patients without VTE based on residence and gender. The matched\npatients lived in the same city and had the same gender.

As for\nthese patients, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy should be considered\nbefore surgery.\nIntroduction\n      The occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), together\ndescribed as venous thromboembolism (VTE), is a common complication of cancer, with\nan incidence of 1-20%.1,2\nCancer is recognized as an independent risk factor of VTE, patients with cancer are\nassociated with a four-to seven-fold higher risk of VTE than patients without a\nmalignancy.3,4\nPatients with cancer have a prothrombotic state resulting from stasis of the blood\ncaused by bed rest or by tumor compression, vascular injury caused by intravasation\nof cancer cells or drugs, and blood hypercoagulability caused by the release of\ncancer cell procoagulant factors.5 Besides, the development of VTE\nin cancer patients is related to increases in mortality, and medical costs.\nOccurrence of VTE in cancer patients has been proved to increase the likelihood of\ndeath by two-to six-fold, VTE has become the second leading cause of death in cancer\npatients.6,7\nBesides, costs of patients with VTE associated with hospitalization is 2.5-fold\nhigher, which contributes a substantial economic burden to the family.8,9\n      Many studies have showed that the prevalence of VTE is increased significantly among\nlung cancer patients, and It has been reported that patients with lung cancer are\nmore likely to develop thrombotic events than other cancer patients, with an\nincidence of 13.9%.10,11 VTE can appear before cancer diagnosis, and before the begin of\nlung cancer treatment, the related mechanism may be that patients are in a\nhypercoagulable state.12 One study reported that among 231 cases of lung cancer\npatients before surgery, the incidence of VTE on admission was 5.2%\n(12/231).13 Except cancer-related factors, patient-related factors such as\nadvanced age, race and a priority history of a thrombotic event, and\ntreatment-related factors also contribute to developing VTE in admitted patients\nwith lung cancer.10 Therefore, recognizing the risk factors of VTE in patients with\nlung cancer before surgery has become an important task to prevent and intervene in\nthe occurrence of VTE. However, risk factors identification of VTE in lung carcinoma\npatients before surgery remains poorly studied. Thus, we conducted a retrospective\ncase-control study to analyze the possible risk factors of VTE events in\npreoperative patients with lung cancer. The aim was to provide a basis for clinical\nprevention and treatment of VTE, and further improve the quality of life of\npatients.\nStudied Population\n        We conducted a retrospective case-control study of all admitted lung cancer\npatients with a VTE diagnosed between January 2017 and December 2020 at one\ncancer institution in China.

Our findings showed that older age was one of the\nindependent risk factors of VTE in this population, patients with age more than 60\nyears were more likely to have thrombotic events than those below 60 years. In the\nnormal population, the risk of VTE increases with age, but the association between\nage and VTE in lung cancer patients is controversial.15 Lee YG et al conducted a\nretrospective analysis of 1998 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer,\nand found that advanced age was an independent predictor of VTE development, which\nis consistent with the conclusion of this study.16 While one research among\n91933 patients with newly diagnosed with lung malignancy revealed that younger age\n(<45 years old) was a significant predictor of developing VTE within one year of\nnon-small cell lung cancer diagnosis.17 The reason for this\ninconsistency may be related to the differences of study subjects, tumor biological\ncharacteristics.\n      D-dimer is the minimal degradation product of fibrin, produced by fibrinolytic\nhydrolysis, and is a specific marker indicating activation of fibrinolytic system\nand hypercoagulable state in patients.18-20 During thrombotic event,\nthrombus fibrinolysis leads to an elevated plasma level of D-dimer.21,22 In this\nstudy, we obtained similar results, suggesting that increased D-dimer concentration\nwas correlated with the development of VTE in preoperative lung malignancy patients.\nWells clinical prediction model combines with D-dimer testing, which has proved to\nbe useful in the diagnosis of VTE. However, the level of D-dimer would also be\nelevated in condition of infections, heart failure, tumors, myocardial infarction,\nstroke, and chronic kidney disease.23 Thus, National Comprehensive\nCancer Network (NCCN) guideline of cancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease\nrecommends that further validation of D-dimer testing and clinical prediction models\nis warranted before these strategies are incorporated into the diagnosis of VTE in\ncancer patients.24\n      FIB is an acute reactive protein synthesized and secreted by liver cells, which is\ninvolved in the endogenous hemostatic process of the body.25 FIB is also known as\ncoagulation factor \u2160, and the increase of its level indicates that the body is in a\nstate of hypercoagulation, which is easy to induce the formation of\nthrombus.26,27 What mentioning above is consistent with the results of this\nstudy, which showed that FIB >4\u00a0g/L is associated with higher risk of VTE\ndevelopment in admitted patients with lung cancer.\n      For preoperative patients with lung carcinoma, at admission, chest CT, and color\nDoppler ultrasonography are routinely performed to diagnosis the occurrence of VTE\nevents of patients before surgery in many medical centers. Furthermore, although the\nCaprini risk assessment model has been widely implemented for VTE risk\nstratification in thoracic surgery patients, it showed to be with low specificity in\npatients with resectable lung cancer.28 Our findings may help to\nrecognize the patients with high risk of VTE, and chest CT and ultrasound\nexamination will make sure of the diagnosis next, in order to better use the limited\nmedical resources. Besides, for high-risk patients before surgery, anticoagulant\ntherapy could be given after evaluation of general conditions, such as low molecular\nweight heparin. However, the current research was a single-center retrospective\nstudy with limitations of certain selection bias and small sample size. What is\nmore, although the association between obesity and VTE has been well recognized in\nthe general population and in cancer patients, we failed to find BMI was significant\ndifference between the 2 groups in this study.29,30 Thus, prospective multicenter\nstudies with large sample size are needed to verify the results further, which also\ncan help to establish an effective prediction model of VTE in preoperative patients\nwith lung malignancy.\nConclusions\n      This case-control retrospective study finds that patients aged more than 60 years\nold, D-dimer>500\u00a0ng/mL, FIB>4\u00a0g/L are independent risk factors of VTE in\npreoperative patients with lung cancer. However, considering of the sample size in\nthis study was small, and this study was conducted in a single medical center, the\nresults may need to be further validated.\nORCID iD\n      Fangyuan Zhang https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9759-8488",
