    "description": "Introduction\n      Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. There were 268,600 new cases and 41,760 deaths due to breast cancer estimated in the U.S. in 20191. The use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is associated with up to 23% increased risk of breast cancer. MHT use has been reduced among postmenopausal women since the report by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial and observational study2,3 which has been subsequently confirmed by other studies and meta-analyses4,5. Breast cancer risk increases with longer duration of use6, and is higher for combined estrogen\u2013progesterone MHT (EPT) use as compared with estrogen-only (ET) regimens4,5. Additionally, the association between MHT use and breast cancer may also differ by tumor molecular subtype. A prospective cohort study in UK found that current MHT use was associated with increased risk for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers, but not with ER- breast cancers7. Several other observational studies also found that MHT use was associated with elevated risk of ER+\u2009breast cancer8\u201312.\n      The biological mechanisms underlying the effect of MHT use on breast cancer risk is not fully understood. One proposed mechanism is that higher estrogen and progesterone levels increase the proliferation of breast epithelial cells, which results in accumulation of genetic mutations and insufficient DNA repair13,14, and therefore induces mutagenesis15,16. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with invasive breast cancer risk17\u201319. Further analyses based on these GWAS findings have identified several genes that might interact with MHT use on breast cancer risk, including SNPs regulating the fibroblast growth factor receptor two (FGFR2) gene20, as well as SNPs close to the Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) gene and the insulin like growth-factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) gene21\u201323. A meta-analysis of four genome-wide case-only interaction studies found suggestive evidence of interactions between MHT use and SNPs in genes related to transmembrane signaling and immune cell activation24. However, none of the findings reached genome-wide significance.\n      In the present study, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide interaction analysis of current MHT use by pooling individual-level data from 26 epidemiological studies. We also performed genome-wide interaction analysis of MHT use on ER+\u2009breast cancer specifically.\nMethods\n      \n        Study population and data collection\n        Individual level data were pooled from 26 epidemiological studies, including eight population-based case\u2013control studies, 13 nested studies from prospective cohort studies and five studies with mixed design from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) (Table S1). Data collection instruments for individual studies have been described previously19,23. Breast cancer cases were defined as incident invasive or in-situ breast tumors, confirmed by medical records, pathological reports or death certificates. Cases of benign breast disease or cases diagnosed more than five years before study enrollment were excluded.\n        Participants were excluded if they were male, pre-menopausal, of non-European ancestry, with unknown age at reference date, or missing information on MHT use. Reference date was defined as date of diagnosis for cases, and date of interview for controls. Menopausal status was reported at time of interview. For women with missing menopausal status, we assumed postmenopausal status for those who were\u2009>\u200954\u00a0years old. Only studies with information on MHT use in at least 150 breast cancer cases and 150 controls were included in the data analysis.\n      \n      \n        Ethnical approval and consent to participate\n        All participating studies were approved by the relevant ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from study participants.\n      \n      \n        Menopausal hormone therapy use definition\n        MHT use was defined as use for at least three months of any type of MHT, including EPT and ET. Current MHT use was defined as use at, or within the six months prior to the reference date. Former MHT use was defined as women who had a history of using MHT but had quit more than 6 months prior to the reference date.\n      \n      \n        Genotyping\n        Samples were genotyped by the Illumina custom iSelect genotyping array (iCOGs)25,26 or the Illumina OncoArray 500K (OncoArray)19,27. Details on genotyping, imputation and quality-control checks have been published previously19,26. For these analyses, 9680 cases and 10,598 controls were genotyped using iCOGs, and 17,905 cases and 24,187 controls were genotyped using OncoArray. Both datasets were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 release28. For samples that were genotyped on both iCOGs and OncoArray, OncoArray data was used. SNPs were excluded if imputation r2\u2009<\u20090.5 for iCOGs, and r2\u2009<\u20090.8 for OncoArray. A total of 9,661,037 genetic variants (SNPs and indels) were included for analysis in both datasets.\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        We used multivariable logistic regression models to test for interaction between each genetic variant and current MHT use (compared to never users) on breast cancer risk, adjusting for age at reference date, study, former MHT use, an indicator for study design (1 for population-based case\u2013control or prospective studies, 0 for non-population or mixed case\u2013control studies), an interaction term of study design indicator and current MHT use to account for different main effect of current MHT use by study design, and principal components to account for potential population stratification29, thus fitting a model of the form:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} & logit\\left[\\mathrm{Pr}\\left(D\\right)\\right]= \\alpha +{\\beta }_{c}CurrentMHT+{\\beta }_{g}SNP+{\\beta }_{gc}SNP\\times CurrentMHT\\\\&\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad+{\\beta }_{a}age+\\sum_{i}{\\beta }_{i}{study}_{i}+{\\beta }_{f}FormerMHT+{\\beta }_{p}PopulationBased \\\\&\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad+{\\beta }_{pc}PopulationBased\\times CurrentMHT+\\sum_{j}{\\beta }_{j}{PC}_{j} \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}logitPrD=\u03b1+\u03b2cCurrentMHT+\u03b2gSNP+\u03b2gcSNP\u00d7CurrentMHT+\u03b2aage+\u2211i\u03b2istudyi+\u03b2fFormerMHT+\u03b2pPopulationBased+\u03b2pcPopulationBased\u00d7CurrentMHT+\u2211j\u03b2jPCj\n        Each genetic variant was assessed as a continuous variable in a log-additive odds ratio model.

SNPs in LD (r2\u2009>\u20090.1 based on the build-in 1000G_2014-11_EUR) within 1\u00a0Mb from the most significantly associated SNP were removed so that independent SNPs remained in each region.\n        We also performed sensitivity analysis among patients from the population-based studies only.

Cases were slightly older (mean age: 64\u00a0years) than controls (mean age: 63\u00a0years). Current use of MHT was more common among breast cancer cases (34%) than controls (28%), showing a suggestive increased breast cancer risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.16; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.36; Fig.\u00a01A). A total of 20,131 cases and 22,601 controls from 18 studies also had information on current use of EPT. Current EPT use was more common among cases (19%) than controls (13%) and was associated with an estimated 48% risk increase of breast cancer, compared to non-EPT users (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.29, 1.70; Fig.\u00a01B).Figure 1Main effects of current menopausal hormone therapy use and breast cancer risk by study. (A) Current use of any menopausal hormone therapy. (B) Current use of combined estrogen\u2013progesterone menopausal hormone therapy.\n      A total of 9,661,271 SNPs and indels were successfully imputed from both the OncoArray and iCOGs genotyping platforms and were included in the combined analysis. We did not observe any interactions between variants and current MHT use at genome-wide significance level (p-value\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20138, Fig.\u00a02A). 213 SNPs had suggestive evidence of interaction with MHT use on breast cancer risk (p-value\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20135). After LD-based clumping, 18 independent SNPs remained, none of which were in LD with currently known breast cancer risk GWAS loci (Table 1). The strongest evidence of interaction was for SNP rs4674019, located at chromosome 2q35 (p-value\u2009=\u20092.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20137).

S2 and S3). No genomic inflation was observed in primary or subgroup analyses (Figs. S1, S2 and S3).\nDiscussion\n      In this large genome-wide analysis of postmenopausal women of European ancestry, we did not identify any genetic variants that were strong modifiers of the association between current MHT use on breast cancer risk. Although the interaction between SNP rs4674019 and current MHT use was statistically significant among population-based studies only, the variate allele frequency is relatively rare (EAF\u2009=\u20095%) and needs further validation.\n      Consistent with previous literature2,3,33, we found that current use of MHT, and in particular current EPT use, was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for postmenopausal women. The mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. It has been hypothesized that estrogen stimulates cell proliferation through ER\u03b1-mediated hormone activity and increases mutation rates through a cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic activation that results in DNA damage34. In addition, the risk associated with ER+\u2009breast cancer is substantially higher than for ER- breast cancer, particularly for EPT use, suggesting an ER-dependent pathway5. In vitro and in vivo studies found that estradiol and 4-OH-estradiol, metabolites of estrogen, may induce mutations and damage DNA by forming DNA adducts to bind to adenine and guanine on the DNA backbone35,36. The role of progestogens in human breast carcinogenesis is less clear, although it has been suggested that synthetic progestogens are pro-proliferative and may thus promote cancer cell growth37,38.\n      Although MHT use has been found to be associated with increased breast cancer risk in both epidemiologic and experimental studies, no published studies to date have identified genome-wide significant interactions for breast cancer risk between candidate single variants and MHT use among postmenopausal women39,40. In a previous two-stage GWAS interaction analysis among\u2009~\u20092700 cases and\u2009~\u20092700 controls, five SNPs had suggestive evidence of interaction with current MHT use; but none of them reached genome-wide significance41. A meta-analysis of genome-wide case-only studies in 2920 cases also found no statistically significant interactions between SNPs and MHT use on breast cancer overall or by subtype24. Although our study had a larger sample size and increased statistical power than previous genome-wide analyses, we similarly did not find any genome-wide statistically significant interactions between genetic variants and MHT use in this study, and we further did not replicate previously suggested SNPs (data not shown).\n      The region for which the strongest evidence of interaction with current MHT use on breast cancer risk was observed (lead SNP rs4674019), was also implicated in the analysis restricted to combined EPT use only (p-value\u2009=\u20094.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20136). The rs4674019 SNP is an intronic variant in the coding region for the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 607 (LINC00607). Although the functionality of long non-coding RNAs is still not clear, it has been recently recognized that abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs may play an important role in cell cycle control and cell differentiation, which is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease42\u201344. Expression levels of LINC00607 were found to be significantly downregulated among lung adenocarcinoma tissues, compared to adjacent tissues45. Other GWAS have shown genetic variants in the LINC00607 gene to be associated with height in people of European ancestry46. Previous evidence for long noncoding RNAs in relation to breast cancer risk is limited; but it is possible that changes in exogenous hormone levels due to MHT use result in differential expression that eventually leads to tumorigenesis.\n      We also observed suggestive evidence of interaction between current use of both MHT and EPT and rs146251672. SNP rs146251672 is located in the intronic region for the prickle planar cell polarity protein 2 (PRICKLE2) gene on chromosome 3. PRICKLE2 encodes a non-canonical Wnt signaling protein that mediates feedback amplification to generate asymmetric planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling47. The Wnt pathway has been found to be activated in more than half of breast tumors, and is associated with lower overall survival for breast cancer patients48. In particular, the upregulation of the Wnt/PCP pathway has been suggested to be associated with more malignant phenotypes, such as abnormal tissue polarity, invasion and metastasis49. Exposure to estrogen has been associated with accelerated tumor formation in ER-knockout/Wnt-1 mice36. It is plausible that MHT acts partially through the alternative Wnt pathway rather than ER-dependent pathways to promote breast tumor development.\n      This study constitutes the largest genome-wide interaction analysis for current MHT use and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women to date. We analyzed data from more than 62,000 women for whom we had both MHT use and genotypes from more than 9.6 million genetic variants. We controlled our analysis for potential confounding by population stratification by adjusting for principal components. We performed LD-based clumping, which accounted for correlations between genotypes to identify the strongest signal in each independent region, providing more targeted variants and regions for future investigation.\n      There are some limitations to our study. We used a single binary definition of current MHT use within 6 months prior to reference date and could not evaluate other measures such as age at MHT initiation or duration of MHT use. This could lead to some exposure misclassification, particularly for the non-population based studies, where it is possible that those cases had stopped their MHT use at time of recruitment and were classified as non-current users. Such misclassification would have attenuated the main effect of MHT and reduced our statistical power to detect any interactions. In our sensitivity analysis using population-based studies only, we found stronger interactions between the lead SNPs and MHT use. However, given a smaller sample size in the sensitivity analysis, it is possible that we did not have sufficient statistical power to detect any other potential interactions. We assumed no significant interactions between SNPs and former MHT use, and only adjusted for potential confounding from the main effect of former MHT use in the model based on previous evidence. It is possible that comparing the interaction effect of current MHT use to a combined reference group of never and former users may attenuate the point estimates of the interaction term. The use of estrogen only hormone therapy (ET) was also not available among the study participants, although the statistical power might be further limited since the main association of ET and breast cancer risk is much smaller than EPT use5. Although the impact may be small given our case\u2013control study design and large sample size, it is still possible that the observed SNP-MHT interaction was due to the interaction between SNPs and potential uncontrolled confounders of MHT use that were not available in our study50, such as tolerance of menopausal symptoms or socioeconomic status. In addition, our study sample only included women of European ancestry, and thus, our findings may not be generalizable to other race/ethnicity groups.\n      It is important to note that the lack of statistical interaction, on the log-scale, does not necessarily imply a lack of biological interaction. The results are consistent with a model in which the effects of genetic variants and MHT use combine multiplicatively on risk, which could still indicate important interactions at a functional level. Overall, our results suggest that it is not necessary to include interaction variables for G \u00d7 MHT use in development of breast cancer risk prediction models. Although our results suggested that potential interaction effect between SNP rs4674019 and current MHT, further validation is needed. Several suggestive interactions also warrant further investigations in independent studies.\nConclusion\n      In this large genome-wide SNP-MHT interaction study of breast cancer, we found no strong support for common genetic variants modifying the effect of MHT on breast cancer risk. These results suggest that common genetic variation has limited impact on the observed MHT\u2013breast cancer risk association.\nSupplementary Information\n      The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-022-10121-2.\nDisclaimer\n        Where authors are identified as personnel of the International Agency for Research on Cancer/World Health Organization, the authors alone are responsible for the views expressed in this article and they do not necessarily represent the decisions, policy or views of the International Agency for Research on Cancer/World Health.",
