    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      The incidence of breast cancer ranks first among Chinese female malignant tumours. Even in women worldwide, breast cancer is also the malignant tumour with the highest incidence and mortality and accounts for about 11.6% of total cancer deaths.\n1\n In addition to operation and chemotherapy, endocrine therapy is also a common therapy for breast cancer. According to studies, endocrine therapy is effective in 50%\u201360% of patients with positive oestrogen receptor (ER); the response rate (RR) of endocrine therapy in patients with positive ER and progesterone receptor (PR) may be >75% and that in patients with negative ER and PR is about 10%.\n2\n Endocrine therapies for ER+ breast cancer include selective ER modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as anastrozole, ovarian function suspension (OFS) such as goserelin and selective ER downregulators (SERDs) such as fulvestrant. The main reason for endocrine therapy's failure is the primary or secondary resistance in patients during treatment. Primary resistance is common in breast cancer patients with negative ER and PR. Nevertheless, a considerable part of patients with positive ER also has primary resistance. However, after a certain period of endocrine therapy, almost all patients may have secondary resistance. Therefore, endocrine resistance is a crucial problem to be solved in the treatment of breast cancer.\n      Prolactin's (PRL) role in breast cancer pathogenesis has been gaining increasing attention. PRL is a protein hormone primarily secreted by eosinophils in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. PRL can stimulate DNA synthesis, epithelial cell proliferation and breast milk production by affecting the cell of origin or neighbouring cells in an autocrine/paracrine way and prolactin receptors.\n3\n PRLR, a member of the cytokine receptor family, mediates the growth regulation of PRL on the human breast. In breast cancer studies, these data demonstrated widespread expression of PRL and its receptor (>95%).\n4\n\n\n      An epidemiological survey has proved that the elevated PRL level in the circulation before the confirmation of breast cancer is correlated to metastatic breast cancer (MBC).\n5\n Breast cells can promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis through autocrine or paracrine PRL. PRLR is found in breast tissue. The expression levels of PRL and PRLR in breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissues are elevated in most ER+ and ER\u2212 tumours.\n6\n The study of He Wei et al. found that PRL can boost the proliferation and growth of human breast cancer T\u201047D cells and accelerate the transformation of the cell growth cycle and that the effect is dose\u2010 and time\u2010dependent.\n7\n In the Nurse's Health Study and Nurse's Health Study II, Tvoroger et al. investigated the relationship between PRL and breast cancer risk. They measured PRL levels <10 and \u226510\u00a0years before the diagnosis of breast cancer. After 20\u00a0years of follow\u2010up, the finding has demonstrated an association of prolactin levels <10\u00a0years before diagnosis and breast cancer risk of postmenopausal women, especially for ER(+) tumours and metastatic disease.\n8\n In another case control study, Tikk et al. analysed the association of PRL prediagnostic circulatory levels with the risk of breast cancer through menopause status, HRT therapy with the use of a blood donation system and the hormone receptor status of the breast tumours in 2250 breast cancer cases, the study found that the risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women was higher because of prolactin overexpression. However, this increased risk was limited to women who used postmenopausal HRT when donating blood.\n9\n No evidence existed in other studies that combined hormone therapy increased serum PRL levels in hormone replacement therapy patients.\n10\n, \n11\n\n\n      In addition, knocking down the long PRLR gene can inhibit breast cancer's metastasis in the lung and liver, indicating that the long PRLR gene plays a crucial role in breast cancer metastasis.\n12\n Researchers have demonstrated in Yonezawa's study that the long PRLR associate with breast cancer metastasis by knocking down the long PRLR in two breast cancer models. In both models, knockdown of long PRLR dramatically inhibited lungs and liver metastasis.\n12\n Sutherland et al. used quantitative immunohistochemistry to identify the associations between PRLR levels and time to bone metastasis, and they observed that PRL\u2010PRLR can accelerate bone metastasis in breast cancer and the PRLR overexpression in the primary breast tumour results in a shorter time to metastasis.\n13\n Another study revealed no differences in serum PRL levels among visceral or bone metastases, so further studies are necessary to examine the association of PRL with breast cancer metastasis.\n14\n All these data indicated that PRL is closely correlated to the tumourigenesis and development of breast cancer.\n      Hachim et al. used tissue microarray (TMA) in 102 patients to analyse the relationship of PRLR expression levels and different breast cancer molecular subtypes. They found the PRLR was present in luminal A (30%), luminal B (28.5%) and Her2\u2010enriched (23.08%), but not in triple\u2010negative patients.\n15\n They conducted a larger analysis in GOBO database (1881 patients) to assess PRLR gene expression level and proved that there was a significant association between PRLR expression and the luminal A subtype, but they also found no significant link between PRLR expression and hormone receptors. In the future, the relevance of PRL and molecular subtypes of breast cancer requires further study.\n      As is known, the independent activation of ER ligand is one of the mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance. The evidence suggested that PRL may cause endocrine resistance through this mechanism in vitro.\n16\n The study of O'Leary et al.\n17\n showed that PRL may also activate ER in the absence of oestrogen ligand in vivo, causing endocrine resistance. In this study, the correlation between PRL and breast cancer endocrine resistance was reviewed.\n2\n      ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE MECHANISMS\n      Endocrine resistance is mainly divided into primary resistance and secondary resistance. The mechanisms of primary resistance mainly include: induction of apparent silence of ER by histone deacetylation modification, ER gene mutation (such as conversion of ER\u03b1351\u00a0site tyrosine to aspartic acid), promotion of tamoxifen (TAM) to act as an agonist and tumour growth, gene mutation of ER alpha (ESR) and p21\u2010activated kinase 1 (Pak\n1) and aromatase gene polymorphism.\n17\n\nESR1 and Pak1 gene mutation play a vital role in the endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer with positive ER.\n18\n, \n19\n Secondary resistance is correlated to the expression and functional down\u2010regulation of ER\u03b1, the overexpression of ER\u03b2 of breast cancer with positive ER\u03b1, ligand\u2010independent activation of growth factor receptor (including epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], human epidermal growth factor receptor\u20102 [HER\u20102] and insulin\u2010like growth factor 1 receptor [IGF1\u2010R]) or intracellular kinases (such as mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase [MAPK]), and gene transcription caused by ER phosphorylation due to the activation of the downstream signal transduction pathway from protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Besides, the positive gene of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is also correlated to breast cancer resistance.\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n In the mechanism of endocrine resistance, ER missing accounts for 15%\u201320% and ER mutation <1%.\n23\n Figure\u00a01 briefly depicts the mechanism of endocrine resistance.\n      \n        FIGURE 1\n        \n          Mechanisms of endocrine resistance.

Blocking the oestrogen\u2010mediated signalling and other over\u2010activated signalling may reverse the resistance of endocrine therapy. The combination of Tamoxifen and growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor (RKI) is also one of the main therapeutic approaches for Tamoxifen\u2010resistant breast cancer with overexpression of EGFR or HER\u20102. In addition, the abnormal expression of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), EGFR, HER\u20102, IGF\u20101R, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGF\u2010R) and abnormal activation such as PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, NF\u2010kB signalling pathway may be involved in drug resistance (Figure\u00a02).\n24\n\n\n          \n            FIGURE 2\n            \n              Mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. (A) Mechanisms of tamoxifen (TAM) resistance may involve the loss of oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha expression, which can be achieved by methylation of CpG islands or histone deacetylase activity in the ESR1 promoter. Tamoxifen\u2010resistant growth is also stimulated by the upregulation of growth factor signalling pathways (HER2, IGF\u2010IR and FGFR) and subsequent activation of the mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade or phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) pathway. Finally, tamoxifen has even been shown to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells when bound to certain coactivators, such as AIB1, and this is especially true in HER2\u2010expressing cells. (B) The mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance share similarities with tamoxifen resistance, especially in terms of growth factor pathway upregulation. The enhanced activity of growth factors such as MAPK can result in oestrogen\u2010independent phosphorylation and activation of ER\u03b1. In addition to growth factor signalling, interferon response genes and anti\u2010apoptotic proteins have also been shown to have increased expression in AI\u2010resistant cells.

Studies have found that tamoxifen\u2010resistant cells overexpress HER\u20102. After tamoxifen treatment, the cells still proliferate malignantly, suggesting that HER\u20102 interacts with ER\u03b1.\n25\n Another study found that breast cancer amplified antigen 1 (AIB1) as an ER\u03b1 co\u2010regulator when HER\u20102 is expressed, and its increased expression is related to tamoxifen resistance.\n26\n YBX1 overexpressing breast cancer cells are resistant to tamoxifen and fulvestrant, which are related to decreased ER and elevated HER\u20102. Tamoxifen treatment can increase the ability of YBX1 to bind to the HER\u20102 promoter region, Induction of HER\u20102 transcriptional activation and increased expression (Figure\u00a03).\n27\n\n\n          \n            FIGURE 3\n            \n              Model depicting YBX1\u2010mediated resistance to anti\u2010oestrogens of breast cancer cells. In oestrogen\u2010dependent ER+ breast cancer cells, YBX1\u2010induced ERBB2 expression is inhibited by YBX1 binding to active ER. Treatment with anti\u2010oestrogens interferes with binding, and free, active YBX1 promotes ERBB2 expression. Reprinted from [27].

Shen et al. found that after treating cells with tamoxifen, PRMT2 expression was reduced, ER\u03b136 expression was increased, and tamoxifen resistance was mediated, while PRMT2 directly bound ER\u03b136 and inhibited its activity, blocking PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signalling pathway can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n28\n Shimoda et al\n29\n found that aspartate\u2010\u03b2\u2010hydroxylase (ASPH) is related to the sensitivity of endocrine therapy. ASPH expression in tamoxifen\u2010resistant breast cancer cells was up\u2010regulated and MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways are involved in drug resistance regulation.\n          It has been well documented that ER\u2010positive breast cancers present the functional receptor tyrosine kinase RET signalling activity. Breast cancers that are sensitive to endocrine therapy often lack RET ligands. In support, the RET ligand GDNF has been shown to induce endocrine therapy resistance (Figure\u00a04).\n30\n Another study found that oestrogen directly activates C\u2010terminal Src kinase (CSK) expression in ER\u2010positive breast cancer, activates p21\u2010activated kinase2 (PAK2) and causes oestrogen\u2010independent growth. ER\u2010positive breast cancer with PAK2 overexpression is linked with resistance to endocrine therapy and poor prognosis. This study used PAK2 inhibitors and ER antagonists on drug\u2010resistant cells to synergistically inhibit breast cancer growth.\n31\n Liang et al\n32\n found that after 4\u2010OH\u2010tamoxifen treated MCF\u20107 cells, melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) was resistant to tamoxifen\u2010resistant MCF\u20107\u2010Tam\u2010R expression in cells is increased, and MCAM promotes tamoxifen resistance by activating the AKT signalling pathway, inducing epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition.\n          \n            FIGURE 4\n            \n              Schematic diagram of RET activation in endocrine sensitive and resistant tumours. Both endocrine sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells express all components of the RET signalling pathway, but endocrine sensitive breast cancer cells lack GDNF to initiate the resistance pathway. By contrast, endocrine resistant cells secret GNDF, which acts in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to promote endocrine resistance in nearby cells. Reprinted from [30].

E380Q, as a mutation of ESR1, is related to oestradiol (E2) hypersensitivity, the increased ability of DNA to bind to oestrogen response elements, and the activity of E2\u2010independent constitutive transactivation. Takeshita et al.\n33\n tested ESR1 mutations (E380Q, Y537S, Y537N, Y537C and D538G) of tumour tissue and plasma cell\u2010free DNA (cfDNA) in 62 patients and found that 21% of patients with advanced breast cancer have ESR1 mutations. The incidence of mutations was 16% for E380Q, 41.6% for Y537S and 33.3% for D538G, Y537N and Y537C. Some samples detected double or triple mutations in ESR1. New anti\u2010estrogens (AE) targeting mutations have been found to have the ability to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and have effects on both wild\u2010type and Y537S and D538G mutants.\n34\n Rinath et al. tested somatic ESR1 mutations in 76 metastatic ER+ breast cancer patients and found the frequency of these mutations was 12%. In preclinical models, these mutations were shown to bring about constitutive activity and relative resistance to endocrine therapy. They believe that these mutations are responsible for driving endocrine resistance in ER+ metastatic breast cancer.\n35\n Keren et al. detected an ER\u03b1 mutation (D538G substitution) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. This mutation leads to a conformational change in the ligand binding domain and further results in resistance to endocrine therapy.\n36\n\n\n          IGF1 is an important regulator of breast development and tumourigenesis. IGF1 and ER\u03b1 interact in ESR1\u00a0mutant cells. Li et al. made ESR1 mutations (Y537S and D538G) in MCF\u20107 and T47D cell lines through gene editing.\n37\n The mutant cells showed IGF signal activation, and IGF1 was more sensitive to growth stimulation. The combined application of IGF1 receptor inhibitor (OSI\u2010906) and fulvestrant in mutant cells can synergistically inhibit tumour cell growth. Martin et al. first reported the existence of ESR1Y537C and ESR1Y537S mutations and found that cells have resistance to endocrine drugs after long\u2010term oestrogen deprivation.\n38\n This naturally occurring ESR1 mutation will provide an important research model for the future basic studies of resistance mechanisms in breast cancer endocrine therapy.\n          Mutations in the CYP19A1 gene, which encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, can result in increased or decreased aromatase activity. In a study by Magnani et al, they found that 21.5% of AI\u2010treated relapsed patients acquired CYP19A1 gene amplification. CYP19A1 amplification not only increased aromatase activity, but also led to oestrogen\u2010independent ER\u03b1 binding to target genes, triggering CYP19A1amp cells to show decreased sensitivity to AI treatment.\n39\n They also found that some patients whose disease progressed after reversible AI treatment occasionally responded to irreversible AI.\n          Germline genetic variation can affect the risk and treatment outcome of breast cancer. Changes in SNPs (such as reduced ZNF423SNP and increased CTSOSNP) are associated with breast cancer risk. ER\u2010positive breast cancer CTSO affects the efficacy of tamoxifen by regulating the levels of ZNF423 and BRCA1. For patients with SNP (CTSO and ZNF423) associated with tamoxifen resistance, PARP inhibitors can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n40\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.2.2\n          Epigenetic factors\n          Non\u2010coding RNA (ncRNA) contains microRNA (miRNA) and long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA). miRNA regulates gene expression by inhibiting or degrading mRNA transcription through translation, and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; lncRNA is involved in the intracellular protein backbone, chromatin circulation, and regulation of mRNA stability.\n41\n\n\n          It has been demonstrated that the expression of Mirna\u2010449a was significantly down\u2010regulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant breast cancer cells and patients' peripheral blood. MiRNA\u2010449a regulates ADAM22 and further affects tamoxifen resistance through PPARG, LGI1, KRAS and LYN. Recovery of miRNA\u2010449a expression can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n42\n Another study reported that in endocrine\u2010sensitive breast cancer MCF\u20107 cells, the expression of miRNA\u201029a and miRNA\u201029b\u20101 was inhibited after tamoxifen was used, while miRNA was inhibited by tamoxifen in resistant cells LY2. Activated, tamoxifen can reduce the target of miRNA\u201029 in LY2 cells, DIC\u2010ER1. Overexpression of miRNA\u201029a and miRNA\u201029b\u20101 can reduce breast cancer cells' (MCF\u20107, LCC9 and LY2) proliferation and inhibit LY2 cells' migration and tumour colony formation, but does not increase the sensitivity of LCC9 or LY2 cells to tamoxifen.\n43\n\n\n          Studies have found that HOTAIR in lncRNA affects the regulation of HOXD by affecting polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) binding to homeobox D (HOXD) cluster DNA. PRC2 can promote the histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), thereby inhibiting transcription, leading to blocked differentiation and increase the metastasis and invasion of breast cancer cells. HOTAIR overexpression is thought to be related to oestrogen response elements in its promoter, and E2 induces HOTAIR expression in breast cancer. HOTAIR is upregulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant ER\u2010positive breast cancer and further causes tamoxifen resistance.\n44\n, \n45\n Wu et al.\n46\n found that UCA1 in lncRNA enhanced breast cancer cells' resistance to tamoxifen by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway. UCA1 expression was significantly upregulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant cells, and LCC2 and LCC9 cells transfected with UCA1 siRNA had a higher apoptotic rate after using tamoxifen. The study also found that UCA1 siRNA significantly reduced pAKT and p\u2010mTOR protein levels in LCC2 and LCC9 cells, and MCF\u20107 cells over\u2010expressed UCA1 could reduce tamoxifen\u2010induced apoptosis. The protective effect of UCA1 on tumour cells was weakened after Rapamycin treatment.\n          LincRNA\u2010regulator of reprogramming (Linc\u2010RoR), a regulator that promotes oestrogen\u2010independent breast cancer cell growth and tamoxifen resistance, plays an essential role in endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer. Studies have found that Linc\u2010RoR expression is still up\u2010regulated after the cells were deprived of oestrogen, and knocking out Linc\u2010RoR can eliminate oestrogen\u2010independent growth of MCF\u20107 cells and reverse the cell phenotype. At the same time, dual specificity phosphatase7 (DUSP7) is used as a negative regulator of ERK, which reduces the stability of DUSP7 through Linc\u2010RoR and activates the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway (Figure\u00a05).\n47\n\n\n          \n            FIGURE 5\n            \n              The working model of present study. Linc\u2010RoR promotes oestrogen\u2010independent growth (EIG) of ER+ breast cells through conferring the activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. See text for explanation. Reprinted from [447].

Several studies have reported enrichment of CSCs after endocrine therapies.\n48\n, \n49\n Endocrine therapies enhance CSCs' stem\u2010like feature and tumour\u2010initiating ability, which probably responsible for treatment resistance and subsequent disease progression.\n50\n, \n51\n Breast cancer stem cells have often been involved in endocrine resistance, although it is less clear whether they are enough to drive resistance. Simoes et al.\n48\n reported that the activity and the frequency of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) in ER+ patient samples and early and metastatic patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) were increased after tamoxifen and fulvestrant endocrine therapy. Their study indicated that endocrine therapies do not target BCSCs, which may interpret how residual drug\u2010resistant cells cause the relapse of ER+ tumours after hormonal treatment. Tumours of patients with poorer outcomes after endocrine therapies revealed elevated ALDH1 expression and NOTCH4 activation. Moreover, endocrine therapy for ER+ breast cancer specifically increases the JAG1\u2010NOTCH4 signalling pathway, and its combination with the Notch pathway inhibitor can restrain BCSC enrichment leaded by endocrine therapies. Thus, JAG1 ligand signalling through the NOTCH4 receptor is a decisive factor for gaining endocrine resistance in ALDH\u2010positive cell populations. SRC3 can promote the stem\u2010like state of CSCs and induce EMT. It can also lead to worse outcomes and tamoxifen resistance of patients when overexpressed in breast cancer cells.\n26\n, \n52\n Other stem cell\u2010promoting factors such as SOX9 and FOXM1 are also involved in endocrine resistance.\n53\n, \n54\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.3.2\n          Tumour microenvironment\n          The tumour microenvironment (TME) refers to the surrounding microenvironment in which tumour cells exist, including surrounding blood vessels, fibroblasts, immune and inflammatory cells, signalling molecules and the extracellular matrix (ECM). A growing amount of evidence has suggested that several TME components such as cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts, ECM and immune and inflammatory cells play a pivotal role in endocrine resistance.\n          \n            Hypoxia\n            Hypoxic microenvironments in solid tumours result from available oxygen being consumed by rapidly proliferating tumour cells, resulting in the oxygen levels around the tumour are significantly lower than in healthy tissues. Studies have also shown that hypoxia is related to endocrine resistance.\n55\n Hypoxia\u2010inducible factor 1\u2010alpha (HIF\u20101\u03b1) can induce cancer cell resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment, and its over\u2010expression in ER\u03b1+ patients is associated with poor survival to endocrine therapy.\n56\n Morotti et al. suggested that HIF\u20101\u03b1makes up for the deficiency of ER\u03b1 expression for keeping up the expression of SNAT2 under hypoxia or endocrine treatments. In vivo, SNAT2 overexpression produces complete resistance to anti\u2010oestrogen therapy and induces tamoxifen resistance. Its expression is related to breast cancer patients' poor survival and resistance to endocrine therapy in ER\u2010receptor+ patients.\n57\n There are also other studies demonstrating that hypoxia and HIF\u20101\u03b1 may play a significant role in endocrine treatment resistance.\n55\n, \n58\n, \n59\n\n\n          \n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts\n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) is a cell type that, by initiating the extracellular matrix's remodelling or secreting cytokines, promotes tumourigenic features. CAFs provide pathways for aggressive cancers and promote invasion and metastasis by the biochemical alteration and cancer\u2010related pathways' regulation.\n60\n CAFs are the largest stromal cell population in breast cancer and play a key role in breast cancer cells proliferation by producing cytokines and growth factors, remodelling of ECM and modulating immune cell function, further leading to endocrine resistance.\n61\n, \n62\n Brechbuhl et al. analysed the presence of CD146\u2010positive and CD146\u2010negative CAFs in ER+ breast cancer patients' tissues and found that CD146\u2010negative CAFs reduce ER expression and tumour cell sensitivity to oestrogen and tamoxifen sensitivity in ER breast cancer cells. They also demonstrated that CD146\u2010negative CAFs are associated with poor drug response to tamoxifen and worse outcome in patients.\n63\n\n\n          \n          \n            Extracellular matrix\n            The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, and researchers have proved that it plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.\n64\n Jansen et al.\n65\n examined 112 ER\u2010positive primary breast cancers with the advanced disease after treated with tamoxifen and clearly defined the type of treatment response (52 with objective response vs 60 with progressive disease). They identified 81 genes expressed differently between tamoxifen\u2010sensitive and drug\u2010resistant tumours. Forty\u2010four genes were extracted for predictive characteristics and verified on an independent group of 66 tumours. Among the identified genomes, a group of ECM genes, namely TIMP3, fibronectin 1 (FN1), LOX, collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), SPARC and tenascin C (TNC), were found to be relevant to tamoxifen resistance. Pontiggia et al. showed that the factors produced by fibroblasts derived from M05\u00a0mouse breast tumours make tamoxifen resistant to other sensitive epithelial cells. On the other hand, fibronectin binds to \u03b21 integrin and activates the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways, making epithelial cells refractory to tamoxifen. In conclusion, tumour stroma can lead to tamoxifen resistance. Combining endocrine therapy and treatment for the tumour microenvironment has the potential to be an alternative approach to conquer endocrine resistance in breast cancer.\n66\n\n\n          \n          \n            Extracellular vesicles\n            Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membranous vesicles released by cells into the extracellular matrix, have been demonstrated to be potential modulators of tumour progression and drug resistance by translocating genetic material into recipient cells.\n67\n Sansone et al.\n68\n demonstrated that CAFs can package intact mitochondrial genome into EVs, which is released and absorbed by dormant CSCs, subsequently transcribing donor mtDNA, contributing to the restoration of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CSCs' self\u2010renovating and the endocrine therapy resistance. Therefore, we believe that EVs play a substantial role in endocrine therapy resistance.\n          \n          \n            The immune system\n            Inflammation coordinates the microenvironment surrounding the tumour and promotes proliferation, survival and migration.\n69\n In recent studies, inflammatory cytokines have been correlated with endocrine resistance. Tumour\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main part of the tumour microenvironment in the majority of cancers. TAMs can strengthen breast cancer cell aggression by degrading ECM, promoting tumour angiogenesis and restraining cytotoxic T cells' anti\u2010tumour function, causing poor patient prognosis.\n70\n Castellaro et al.\n71\n found that animal xenograft tumours did not grow when MCF\u20107 cells were injected in animal xenograft tumours after removal of oestradiol particles but grew when co\u2010injected with macrophages, suggesting that macrophages might promote breast cancer endocrine resistance.\n            Anti\u2010oestrogen treatment can induce transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) cytokines in breast cancer cells, resulting in the development of anti\u2010oestrogen resistance and immunosuppression.\n72\n Stender et al. indicated that pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) result in ER\u03b1\u2010dependent transcriptional activation by IKK\u03b2\u2010dependent phosphorylation of ER\u03b1\u2010S305, contributing to endocrine resistance.\n73\n\n\n            The interplay between tumour cells and immune cells is increasingly pivotal in the development and progression of cancer. In a phase III trial, researchers examined the clinical relevance of tumour\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and breast cancer and found that TILs were lower in the ER\u2010positive/HER2\u2010negative subgroups compared with ER\u2010negative/HER2\u2010negative and HER2\u2010positive breast cancer subgroups (2.9% vs 10.6% and 11.1%).\n74\n\n\n            Rugo et al. analysed the programmed death ligand 1(PD\u2010L1)'s expression levels in ER+ tumours and only 20% of patients expressed PD\u2010L1, and single\u2010agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) had limited efficacy in ER+, PD\u2010L1\u2010positive tumours.\n75\n Another study investigated the relationship between ER\u03b1 and PD\u2010L1 in breast cancer and identified ER\u03b1 as a negative regulator of PD\u2010L1 gene transcription.\n76\n Anurag et al. identified the upregulated genes in endocrine therapy resistant tumours via unbiased genome\u2010wide profiling analysis and showed that overexpression of the immune checkpoint components IDO1, LAG3 and PD1 was correlated with AI\u2010resistant proliferation in luminal B tumours. IDO1 was also related to poor survival prognosis in luminal B cases.\n77\n Future studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of immune cells in endocrine resistance.\n2.1\n        Receptor\u2010mediated signalling in endocrine therapy resistance\n        \n          2.1.1\n          Oestrogen receptor\u2010mediated signalling\n          The interaction between ER signalling and other receptor\u2010mediated signalling plays a crucial part in the therapeutic process for endocrine resistance. Blocking the oestrogen\u2010mediated signalling and other over\u2010activated signalling may reverse the resistance of endocrine therapy. The combination of Tamoxifen and growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor (RKI) is also one of the main therapeutic approaches for Tamoxifen\u2010resistant breast cancer with overexpression of EGFR or HER\u20102. In addition, the abnormal expression of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), EGFR, HER\u20102, IGF\u20101R, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGF\u2010R) and abnormal activation such as PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, NF\u2010kB signalling pathway may be involved in drug resistance (Figure\u00a02).\n24\n\n\n          \n            FIGURE 2\n            \n              Mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. (A) Mechanisms of tamoxifen (TAM) resistance may involve the loss of oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha expression, which can be achieved by methylation of CpG islands or histone deacetylase activity in the ESR1 promoter. Tamoxifen\u2010resistant growth is also stimulated by the upregulation of growth factor signalling pathways (HER2, IGF\u2010IR and FGFR) and subsequent activation of the mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade or phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) pathway. Finally, tamoxifen has even been shown to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells when bound to certain coactivators, such as AIB1, and this is especially true in HER2\u2010expressing cells. (B) The mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance share similarities with tamoxifen resistance, especially in terms of growth factor pathway upregulation. The enhanced activity of growth factors such as MAPK can result in oestrogen\u2010independent phosphorylation and activation of ER\u03b1.

E380Q, as a mutation of ESR1, is related to oestradiol (E2) hypersensitivity, the increased ability of DNA to bind to oestrogen response elements, and the activity of E2\u2010independent constitutive transactivation. Takeshita et al.\n33\n tested ESR1 mutations (E380Q, Y537S, Y537N, Y537C and D538G) of tumour tissue and plasma cell\u2010free DNA (cfDNA) in 62 patients and found that 21% of patients with advanced breast cancer have ESR1 mutations. The incidence of mutations was 16% for E380Q, 41.6% for Y537S and 33.3% for D538G, Y537N and Y537C. Some samples detected double or triple mutations in ESR1. New anti\u2010estrogens (AE) targeting mutations have been found to have the ability to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and have effects on both wild\u2010type and Y537S and D538G mutants.\n34\n Rinath et al. tested somatic ESR1 mutations in 76 metastatic ER+ breast cancer patients and found the frequency of these mutations was 12%. In preclinical models, these mutations were shown to bring about constitutive activity and relative resistance to endocrine therapy. They believe that these mutations are responsible for driving endocrine resistance in ER+ metastatic breast cancer.\n35\n Keren et al. detected an ER\u03b1 mutation (D538G substitution) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. This mutation leads to a conformational change in the ligand binding domain and further results in resistance to endocrine therapy.\n36\n\n\n          IGF1 is an important regulator of breast development and tumourigenesis. IGF1 and ER\u03b1 interact in ESR1\u00a0mutant cells. Li et al. made ESR1 mutations (Y537S and D538G) in MCF\u20107 and T47D cell lines through gene editing.\n37\n The mutant cells showed IGF signal activation, and IGF1 was more sensitive to growth stimulation. The combined application of IGF1 receptor inhibitor (OSI\u2010906) and fulvestrant in mutant cells can synergistically inhibit tumour cell growth. Martin et al. first reported the existence of ESR1Y537C and ESR1Y537S mutations and found that cells have resistance to endocrine drugs after long\u2010term oestrogen deprivation.\n38\n This naturally occurring ESR1 mutation will provide an important research model for the future basic studies of resistance mechanisms in breast cancer endocrine therapy.\n          Mutations in the CYP19A1 gene, which encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, can result in increased or decreased aromatase activity. In a study by Magnani et al, they found that 21.5% of AI\u2010treated relapsed patients acquired CYP19A1 gene amplification. CYP19A1 amplification not only increased aromatase activity, but also led to oestrogen\u2010independent ER\u03b1 binding to target genes, triggering CYP19A1amp cells to show decreased sensitivity to AI treatment.\n39\n They also found that some patients whose disease progressed after reversible AI treatment occasionally responded to irreversible AI.\n          Germline genetic variation can affect the risk and treatment outcome of breast cancer. Changes in SNPs (such as reduced ZNF423SNP and increased CTSOSNP) are associated with breast cancer risk. ER\u2010positive breast cancer CTSO affects the efficacy of tamoxifen by regulating the levels of ZNF423 and BRCA1. For patients with SNP (CTSO and ZNF423) associated with tamoxifen resistance, PARP inhibitors can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n40\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.2.2\n          Epigenetic factors\n          Non\u2010coding RNA (ncRNA) contains microRNA (miRNA) and long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA). miRNA regulates gene expression by inhibiting or degrading mRNA transcription through translation, and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; lncRNA is involved in the intracellular protein backbone, chromatin circulation, and regulation of mRNA stability.\n41\n\n\n          It has been demonstrated that the expression of Mirna\u2010449a was significantly down\u2010regulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant breast cancer cells and patients' peripheral blood. MiRNA\u2010449a regulates ADAM22 and further affects tamoxifen resistance through PPARG, LGI1, KRAS and LYN. Recovery of miRNA\u2010449a expression can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n42\n Another study reported that in endocrine\u2010sensitive breast cancer MCF\u20107 cells, the expression of miRNA\u201029a and miRNA\u201029b\u20101 was inhibited after tamoxifen was used, while miRNA was inhibited by tamoxifen in resistant cells LY2. Activated, tamoxifen can reduce the target of miRNA\u201029 in LY2 cells, DIC\u2010ER1. Overexpression of miRNA\u201029a and miRNA\u201029b\u20101 can reduce breast cancer cells' (MCF\u20107, LCC9 and LY2) proliferation and inhibit LY2 cells' migration and tumour colony formation, but does not increase the sensitivity of LCC9 or LY2 cells to tamoxifen.\n43\n\n\n          Studies have found that HOTAIR in lncRNA affects the regulation of HOXD by affecting polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) binding to homeobox D (HOXD) cluster DNA. PRC2 can promote the histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), thereby inhibiting transcription, leading to blocked differentiation and increase the metastasis and invasion of breast cancer cells. HOTAIR overexpression is thought to be related to oestrogen response elements in its promoter, and E2 induces HOTAIR expression in breast cancer. HOTAIR is upregulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant ER\u2010positive breast cancer and further causes tamoxifen resistance.\n44\n, \n45\n Wu et al.\n46\n found that UCA1 in lncRNA enhanced breast cancer cells' resistance to tamoxifen by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway. UCA1 expression was significantly upregulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant cells, and LCC2 and LCC9 cells transfected with UCA1 siRNA had a higher apoptotic rate after using tamoxifen. The study also found that UCA1 siRNA significantly reduced pAKT and p\u2010mTOR protein levels in LCC2 and LCC9 cells, and MCF\u20107 cells over\u2010expressed UCA1 could reduce tamoxifen\u2010induced apoptosis. The protective effect of UCA1 on tumour cells was weakened after Rapamycin treatment.\n          LincRNA\u2010regulator of reprogramming (Linc\u2010RoR), a regulator that promotes oestrogen\u2010independent breast cancer cell growth and tamoxifen resistance, plays an essential role in endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer. Studies have found that Linc\u2010RoR expression is still up\u2010regulated after the cells were deprived of oestrogen, and knocking out Linc\u2010RoR can eliminate oestrogen\u2010independent growth of MCF\u20107 cells and reverse the cell phenotype. At the same time, dual specificity phosphatase7 (DUSP7) is used as a negative regulator of ERK, which reduces the stability of DUSP7 through Linc\u2010RoR and activates the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway (Figure\u00a05).\n47\n\n\n          \n            FIGURE 5\n            \n              The working model of present study.

Takeshita et al.\n33\n tested ESR1 mutations (E380Q, Y537S, Y537N, Y537C and D538G) of tumour tissue and plasma cell\u2010free DNA (cfDNA) in 62 patients and found that 21% of patients with advanced breast cancer have ESR1 mutations. The incidence of mutations was 16% for E380Q, 41.6% for Y537S and 33.3% for D538G, Y537N and Y537C. Some samples detected double or triple mutations in ESR1. New anti\u2010estrogens (AE) targeting mutations have been found to have the ability to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and have effects on both wild\u2010type and Y537S and D538G mutants.\n34\n Rinath et al. tested somatic ESR1 mutations in 76 metastatic ER+ breast cancer patients and found the frequency of these mutations was 12%. In preclinical models, these mutations were shown to bring about constitutive activity and relative resistance to endocrine therapy. They believe that these mutations are responsible for driving endocrine resistance in ER+ metastatic breast cancer.\n35\n Keren et al. detected an ER\u03b1 mutation (D538G substitution) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. This mutation leads to a conformational change in the ligand binding domain and further results in resistance to endocrine therapy.\n36\n\n\n          IGF1 is an important regulator of breast development and tumourigenesis. IGF1 and ER\u03b1 interact in ESR1\u00a0mutant cells. Li et al. made ESR1 mutations (Y537S and D538G) in MCF\u20107 and T47D cell lines through gene editing.\n37\n The mutant cells showed IGF signal activation, and IGF1 was more sensitive to growth stimulation. The combined application of IGF1 receptor inhibitor (OSI\u2010906) and fulvestrant in mutant cells can synergistically inhibit tumour cell growth. Martin et al. first reported the existence of ESR1Y537C and ESR1Y537S mutations and found that cells have resistance to endocrine drugs after long\u2010term oestrogen deprivation.\n38\n This naturally occurring ESR1 mutation will provide an important research model for the future basic studies of resistance mechanisms in breast cancer endocrine therapy.\n          Mutations in the CYP19A1 gene, which encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, can result in increased or decreased aromatase activity. In a study by Magnani et al, they found that 21.5% of AI\u2010treated relapsed patients acquired CYP19A1 gene amplification. CYP19A1 amplification not only increased aromatase activity, but also led to oestrogen\u2010independent ER\u03b1 binding to target genes, triggering CYP19A1amp cells to show decreased sensitivity to AI treatment.\n39\n They also found that some patients whose disease progressed after reversible AI treatment occasionally responded to irreversible AI.\n          Germline genetic variation can affect the risk and treatment outcome of breast cancer. Changes in SNPs (such as reduced ZNF423SNP and increased CTSOSNP) are associated with breast cancer risk. ER\u2010positive breast cancer CTSO affects the efficacy of tamoxifen by regulating the levels of ZNF423 and BRCA1. For patients with SNP (CTSO and ZNF423) associated with tamoxifen resistance, PARP inhibitors can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n40\n2.2.2\n          Epigenetic factors\n          Non\u2010coding RNA (ncRNA) contains microRNA (miRNA) and long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA). miRNA regulates gene expression by inhibiting or degrading mRNA transcription through translation, and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; lncRNA is involved in the intracellular protein backbone, chromatin circulation, and regulation of mRNA stability.\n41\n\n\n          It has been demonstrated that the expression of Mirna\u2010449a was significantly down\u2010regulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant breast cancer cells and patients' peripheral blood. MiRNA\u2010449a regulates ADAM22 and further affects tamoxifen resistance through PPARG, LGI1, KRAS and LYN. Recovery of miRNA\u2010449a expression can reverse tamoxifen resistance.\n42\n Another study reported that in endocrine\u2010sensitive breast cancer MCF\u20107 cells, the expression of miRNA\u201029a and miRNA\u201029b\u20101 was inhibited after tamoxifen was used, while miRNA was inhibited by tamoxifen in resistant cells LY2. Activated, tamoxifen can reduce the target of miRNA\u201029 in LY2 cells, DIC\u2010ER1. Overexpression of miRNA\u201029a and miRNA\u201029b\u20101 can reduce breast cancer cells' (MCF\u20107, LCC9 and LY2) proliferation and inhibit LY2 cells' migration and tumour colony formation, but does not increase the sensitivity of LCC9 or LY2 cells to tamoxifen.\n43\n\n\n          Studies have found that HOTAIR in lncRNA affects the regulation of HOXD by affecting polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) binding to homeobox D (HOXD) cluster DNA. PRC2 can promote the histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), thereby inhibiting transcription, leading to blocked differentiation and increase the metastasis and invasion of breast cancer cells. HOTAIR overexpression is thought to be related to oestrogen response elements in its promoter, and E2 induces HOTAIR expression in breast cancer. HOTAIR is upregulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant ER\u2010positive breast cancer and further causes tamoxifen resistance.\n44\n, \n45\n Wu et al.\n46\n found that UCA1 in lncRNA enhanced breast cancer cells' resistance to tamoxifen by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway. UCA1 expression was significantly upregulated in tamoxifen\u2010resistant cells, and LCC2 and LCC9 cells transfected with UCA1 siRNA had a higher apoptotic rate after using tamoxifen. The study also found that UCA1 siRNA significantly reduced pAKT and p\u2010mTOR protein levels in LCC2 and LCC9 cells, and MCF\u20107 cells over\u2010expressed UCA1 could reduce tamoxifen\u2010induced apoptosis. The protective effect of UCA1 on tumour cells was weakened after Rapamycin treatment.\n          LincRNA\u2010regulator of reprogramming (Linc\u2010RoR), a regulator that promotes oestrogen\u2010independent breast cancer cell growth and tamoxifen resistance, plays an essential role in endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer. Studies have found that Linc\u2010RoR expression is still up\u2010regulated after the cells were deprived of oestrogen, and knocking out Linc\u2010RoR can eliminate oestrogen\u2010independent growth of MCF\u20107 cells and reverse the cell phenotype. At the same time, dual specificity phosphatase7 (DUSP7) is used as a negative regulator of ERK, which reduces the stability of DUSP7 through Linc\u2010RoR and activates the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway (Figure\u00a05).\n47\n\n\n          \n            FIGURE 5\n            \n              The working model of present study. Linc\u2010RoR promotes oestrogen\u2010independent growth (EIG) of ER+ breast cells through conferring the activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. See text for explanation. Reprinted from [447].

Several studies have reported enrichment of CSCs after endocrine therapies.\n48\n, \n49\n Endocrine therapies enhance CSCs' stem\u2010like feature and tumour\u2010initiating ability, which probably responsible for treatment resistance and subsequent disease progression.\n50\n, \n51\n Breast cancer stem cells have often been involved in endocrine resistance, although it is less clear whether they are enough to drive resistance. Simoes et al.\n48\n reported that the activity and the frequency of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) in ER+ patient samples and early and metastatic patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) were increased after tamoxifen and fulvestrant endocrine therapy. Their study indicated that endocrine therapies do not target BCSCs, which may interpret how residual drug\u2010resistant cells cause the relapse of ER+ tumours after hormonal treatment. Tumours of patients with poorer outcomes after endocrine therapies revealed elevated ALDH1 expression and NOTCH4 activation. Moreover, endocrine therapy for ER+ breast cancer specifically increases the JAG1\u2010NOTCH4 signalling pathway, and its combination with the Notch pathway inhibitor can restrain BCSC enrichment leaded by endocrine therapies. Thus, JAG1 ligand signalling through the NOTCH4 receptor is a decisive factor for gaining endocrine resistance in ALDH\u2010positive cell populations. SRC3 can promote the stem\u2010like state of CSCs and induce EMT. It can also lead to worse outcomes and tamoxifen resistance of patients when overexpressed in breast cancer cells.\n26\n, \n52\n Other stem cell\u2010promoting factors such as SOX9 and FOXM1 are also involved in endocrine resistance.\n53\n, \n54\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.3.2\n          Tumour microenvironment\n          The tumour microenvironment (TME) refers to the surrounding microenvironment in which tumour cells exist, including surrounding blood vessels, fibroblasts, immune and inflammatory cells, signalling molecules and the extracellular matrix (ECM). A growing amount of evidence has suggested that several TME components such as cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts, ECM and immune and inflammatory cells play a pivotal role in endocrine resistance.\n          \n            Hypoxia\n            Hypoxic microenvironments in solid tumours result from available oxygen being consumed by rapidly proliferating tumour cells, resulting in the oxygen levels around the tumour are significantly lower than in healthy tissues. Studies have also shown that hypoxia is related to endocrine resistance.\n55\n Hypoxia\u2010inducible factor 1\u2010alpha (HIF\u20101\u03b1) can induce cancer cell resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment, and its over\u2010expression in ER\u03b1+ patients is associated with poor survival to endocrine therapy.\n56\n Morotti et al. suggested that HIF\u20101\u03b1makes up for the deficiency of ER\u03b1 expression for keeping up the expression of SNAT2 under hypoxia or endocrine treatments. In vivo, SNAT2 overexpression produces complete resistance to anti\u2010oestrogen therapy and induces tamoxifen resistance. Its expression is related to breast cancer patients' poor survival and resistance to endocrine therapy in ER\u2010receptor+ patients.\n57\n There are also other studies demonstrating that hypoxia and HIF\u20101\u03b1 may play a significant role in endocrine treatment resistance.\n55\n, \n58\n, \n59\n\n\n          \n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts\n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) is a cell type that, by initiating the extracellular matrix's remodelling or secreting cytokines, promotes tumourigenic features. CAFs provide pathways for aggressive cancers and promote invasion and metastasis by the biochemical alteration and cancer\u2010related pathways' regulation.\n60\n CAFs are the largest stromal cell population in breast cancer and play a key role in breast cancer cells proliferation by producing cytokines and growth factors, remodelling of ECM and modulating immune cell function, further leading to endocrine resistance.\n61\n, \n62\n Brechbuhl et al. analysed the presence of CD146\u2010positive and CD146\u2010negative CAFs in ER+ breast cancer patients' tissues and found that CD146\u2010negative CAFs reduce ER expression and tumour cell sensitivity to oestrogen and tamoxifen sensitivity in ER breast cancer cells. They also demonstrated that CD146\u2010negative CAFs are associated with poor drug response to tamoxifen and worse outcome in patients.\n63\n\n\n          \n          \n            Extracellular matrix\n            The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, and researchers have proved that it plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.\n64\n Jansen et al.\n65\n examined 112 ER\u2010positive primary breast cancers with the advanced disease after treated with tamoxifen and clearly defined the type of treatment response (52 with objective response vs 60 with progressive disease). They identified 81 genes expressed differently between tamoxifen\u2010sensitive and drug\u2010resistant tumours. Forty\u2010four genes were extracted for predictive characteristics and verified on an independent group of 66 tumours. Among the identified genomes, a group of ECM genes, namely TIMP3, fibronectin 1 (FN1), LOX, collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), SPARC and tenascin C (TNC), were found to be relevant to tamoxifen resistance. Pontiggia et al. showed that the factors produced by fibroblasts derived from M05\u00a0mouse breast tumours make tamoxifen resistant to other sensitive epithelial cells. On the other hand, fibronectin binds to \u03b21 integrin and activates the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways, making epithelial cells refractory to tamoxifen. In conclusion, tumour stroma can lead to tamoxifen resistance. Combining endocrine therapy and treatment for the tumour microenvironment has the potential to be an alternative approach to conquer endocrine resistance in breast cancer.\n66\n\n\n          \n          \n            Extracellular vesicles\n            Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membranous vesicles released by cells into the extracellular matrix, have been demonstrated to be potential modulators of tumour progression and drug resistance by translocating genetic material into recipient cells.\n67\n Sansone et al.\n68\n demonstrated that CAFs can package intact mitochondrial genome into EVs, which is released and absorbed by dormant CSCs, subsequently transcribing donor mtDNA, contributing to the restoration of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CSCs' self\u2010renovating and the endocrine therapy resistance. Therefore, we believe that EVs play a substantial role in endocrine therapy resistance.\n          \n          \n            The immune system\n            Inflammation coordinates the microenvironment surrounding the tumour and promotes proliferation, survival and migration.\n69\n In recent studies, inflammatory cytokines have been correlated with endocrine resistance. Tumour\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main part of the tumour microenvironment in the majority of cancers. TAMs can strengthen breast cancer cell aggression by degrading ECM, promoting tumour angiogenesis and restraining cytotoxic T cells' anti\u2010tumour function, causing poor patient prognosis.\n70\n Castellaro et al.\n71\n found that animal xenograft tumours did not grow when MCF\u20107 cells were injected in animal xenograft tumours after removal of oestradiol particles but grew when co\u2010injected with macrophages, suggesting that macrophages might promote breast cancer endocrine resistance.\n            Anti\u2010oestrogen treatment can induce transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) cytokines in breast cancer cells, resulting in the development of anti\u2010oestrogen resistance and immunosuppression.\n72\n Stender et al. indicated that pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) result in ER\u03b1\u2010dependent transcriptional activation by IKK\u03b2\u2010dependent phosphorylation of ER\u03b1\u2010S305, contributing to endocrine resistance.\n73\n\n\n            The interplay between tumour cells and immune cells is increasingly pivotal in the development and progression of cancer. In a phase III trial, researchers examined the clinical relevance of tumour\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and breast cancer and found that TILs were lower in the ER\u2010positive/HER2\u2010negative subgroups compared with ER\u2010negative/HER2\u2010negative and HER2\u2010positive breast cancer subgroups (2.9% vs 10.6% and 11.1%).\n74\n\n\n            Rugo et al. analysed the programmed death ligand 1(PD\u2010L1)'s expression levels in ER+ tumours and only 20% of patients expressed PD\u2010L1, and single\u2010agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) had limited efficacy in ER+, PD\u2010L1\u2010positive tumours.\n75\n Another study investigated the relationship between ER\u03b1 and PD\u2010L1 in breast cancer and identified ER\u03b1 as a negative regulator of PD\u2010L1 gene transcription.\n76\n Anurag et al. identified the upregulated genes in endocrine therapy resistant tumours via unbiased genome\u2010wide profiling analysis and showed that overexpression of the immune checkpoint components IDO1, LAG3 and PD1 was correlated with AI\u2010resistant proliferation in luminal B tumours. IDO1 was also related to poor survival prognosis in luminal B cases.\n77\n Future studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of immune cells in endocrine resistance.\n2.3.1\n          Cancer stem cells\n          Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a rare tumour cell population, accumulate and likely contribute to their failure after anti\u2010oestrogen treatment.

They also demonstrated that CD146\u2010negative CAFs are associated with poor drug response to tamoxifen and worse outcome in patients.\n63\nExtracellular matrix\n            The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, and researchers have proved that it plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.\n64\n Jansen et al.\n65\n examined 112 ER\u2010positive primary breast cancers with the advanced disease after treated with tamoxifen and clearly defined the type of treatment response (52 with objective response vs 60 with progressive disease). They identified 81 genes expressed differently between tamoxifen\u2010sensitive and drug\u2010resistant tumours. Forty\u2010four genes were extracted for predictive characteristics and verified on an independent group of 66 tumours. Among the identified genomes, a group of ECM genes, namely TIMP3, fibronectin 1 (FN1), LOX, collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), SPARC and tenascin C (TNC), were found to be relevant to tamoxifen resistance. Pontiggia et al. showed that the factors produced by fibroblasts derived from M05\u00a0mouse breast tumours make tamoxifen resistant to other sensitive epithelial cells. On the other hand, fibronectin binds to \u03b21 integrin and activates the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways, making epithelial cells refractory to tamoxifen. In conclusion, tumour stroma can lead to tamoxifen resistance. Combining endocrine therapy and treatment for the tumour microenvironment has the potential to be an alternative approach to conquer endocrine resistance in breast cancer.\n66\nExtracellular vesicles\n            Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membranous vesicles released by cells into the extracellular matrix, have been demonstrated to be potential modulators of tumour progression and drug resistance by translocating genetic material into recipient cells.\n67\n Sansone et al.\n68\n demonstrated that CAFs can package intact mitochondrial genome into EVs, which is released and absorbed by dormant CSCs, subsequently transcribing donor mtDNA, contributing to the restoration of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CSCs' self\u2010renovating and the endocrine therapy resistance. Therefore, we believe that EVs play a substantial role in endocrine therapy resistance.\nThe immune system\n            Inflammation coordinates the microenvironment surrounding the tumour and promotes proliferation, survival and migration.\n69\n In recent studies, inflammatory cytokines have been correlated with endocrine resistance. Tumour\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main part of the tumour microenvironment in the majority of cancers. TAMs can strengthen breast cancer cell aggression by degrading ECM, promoting tumour angiogenesis and restraining cytotoxic T cells' anti\u2010tumour function, causing poor patient prognosis.\n70\n Castellaro et al.\n71\n found that animal xenograft tumours did not grow when MCF\u20107 cells were injected in animal xenograft tumours after removal of oestradiol particles but grew when co\u2010injected with macrophages, suggesting that macrophages might promote breast cancer endocrine resistance.\n            Anti\u2010oestrogen treatment can induce transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) cytokines in breast cancer cells, resulting in the development of anti\u2010oestrogen resistance and immunosuppression.\n72\n Stender et al. indicated that pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) result in ER\u03b1\u2010dependent transcriptional activation by IKK\u03b2\u2010dependent phosphorylation of ER\u03b1\u2010S305, contributing to endocrine resistance.\n73\n\n\n            The interplay between tumour cells and immune cells is increasingly pivotal in the development and progression of cancer. In a phase III trial, researchers examined the clinical relevance of tumour\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and breast cancer and found that TILs were lower in the ER\u2010positive/HER2\u2010negative subgroups compared with ER\u2010negative/HER2\u2010negative and HER2\u2010positive breast cancer subgroups (2.9% vs 10.6% and 11.1%).\n74\n\n\n            Rugo et al. analysed the programmed death ligand 1(PD\u2010L1)'s expression levels in ER+ tumours and only 20% of patients expressed PD\u2010L1, and single\u2010agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) had limited efficacy in ER+, PD\u2010L1\u2010positive tumours.\n75\n Another study investigated the relationship between ER\u03b1 and PD\u2010L1 in breast cancer and identified ER\u03b1 as a negative regulator of PD\u2010L1 gene transcription.\n76\n Anurag et al. identified the upregulated genes in endocrine therapy resistant tumours via unbiased genome\u2010wide profiling analysis and showed that overexpression of the immune checkpoint components IDO1, LAG3 and PD1 was correlated with AI\u2010resistant proliferation in luminal B tumours. IDO1 was also related to poor survival prognosis in luminal B cases.\n77\n Future studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of immune cells in endocrine resistance.\n3\n      PRL IN ENDOCRINE THERAPY RESISTANCE\n      Prolactin is a protein hormone secreted by adenohypophysis gland eosinophil. Its major function is to stimulate the growth of breast and induce and maintain milk lactation. Its secretion is modulated by hormones such as hypothalamic prolactin\u2010releasing inhibitory factor (PIF) and prolactin\u2010releasing factor (PRF), and can be self\u2010adjustment by short\u2010loop feedback. Recent studies focusing on prolactin's roles and mechanisms and its receptor in HR\u2010positive breast cancer were listed in Table\u00a01. PRL participates in endocrine therapy resistance mainly by combining with PRLR and activating JAK2\u2010STAT5, ras\u2010raf\u2010 MEK\u2010ERK1 /2, Ras\u2010PI3K and other downstream signalling pathways. Figure\u00a06 demonstrates the mechanism of prolactin in endocrine resistance.\n      \n        TABLE 1\n        \n          Recent studies focusing on the roles of prolactin and its receptor in HR\u2010positive breast cancer\n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              Entry\n              Author\n              Year\n              Institution\n              Country\n              Journal\n              Key findings\n              PMID\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              1\n              Raghuveer Kavarthapu et al.\n              2016\n              Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development\n              USA\n              Oncotarget\n              \n1.

PKA RIIb subunit is a direct target of PAK1, the activated pTyr\u2010PAK1 complex reciprocally potentiated PKA activity. PKA phosphorylated Ser305\u2010ERa in response to estrogen, but pTyr\u2010PAK1 phosphorylated Ser305\u2010ERa in response to prolactin (PRL), implying that maximal ERa phosphorylation is achieved when cells are exposed to both PRL and estrogen\n3. S305\u2010ERa activation led to enhanced phosphorylation of Ser118\u2010ERa and promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth\n4.

PRL can bind to target cells' specific transmembrane receptors and activate the receptor\u2010related Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)2. The activation of JAK can catalyse phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor. JAK kinase can recruit and phosphorylate the STAT protein on the receptor. The activated STAT protein enters the nucleus as a dimer to combine with the target gene, regulates gene transcription and increases ER transcription. PRL enhances oestrogen sensitivity, promotes tumour differentiation and reduces therapeutic sensitivity through this mechanism.\n        The conjugation of prolactin to the prolactin receptor (PRLR) activates STAT5a in the breast to facilitate the gene transcription involved in lobule development. A previous study showed that STAT5a expressed in majority of normal breast epithelial cells, but not generally in carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma, except in those secretory carcinomas that maintain STAT5a. Previous immunohistochemical studies have shown that PRLR is only expressed occasionally on the luminal surface of normal breast epithelial cells that express the STAT5a protein and in cells that express STAT5a protein and in cells that exhibit secretory changes in STAT5a expression, whether benign or malignant.\n78\n, \n79\n STAT5a and PRLR exhibit reciprocal expression patterns between normal and abnormal breast tissue. In DCIS and invasive carcinoma, reverse expression occurs in normal cells, causing an increase in PRLR and a decrease in STAT5a, which might indicate a disturbance in the signalling pathway that may be associated with carcinogenesis.\n78\n, \n79\n\n\n      \n      \n        3.2\n        MicroRNA\u2010339\u20105p\u2010dependent pathway\n        Studies have found that micro RNA339\u20105p (miR\u2010339\u20105p) target the gene B\u2010cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and the expression of BCL6 protein was related to the breast cancer progression.\n80\n Hong Yan et al. revealed that PRL could inhibit BCL6 expression in human breast cancer cells and affect breast cancer development via the miR\u2010339\u20105p\u2010dependent pathway.\n80\n The study showed that PRL inhibited the expression of BCL6 and upregulated the expression of miR\u2010339\u20105p in breast cancer cells. PRL\u2010induced suppression of BCL6 expression was dramatically reversed by selective downregulation of miR\u2010339\u20105p expression. Exogenous PRL stimulation remarkably reduced the proliferation, colony formation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer cells, while miR\u2010339\u20105p expression's suppression reversed these processes in vitro.\n80\n\n\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Prolactin receptor signalling pathway\n        Calcium\u2010modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is a signalling protein recognized by the TNF receptor TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML\u2010interactor). CAML is also involved in signalling at other receptors, such as the EGFR\n81\nand mucin 1 (MUC1).\n82\n Ji\u2010Hong Lim et al. found high expression of CAML in breast cancer cells and tissues.\n83\n Moreover, CAML was found to bind to PRLR, required for PRLR function, such as activation of Stat5 and Mek1/2, internalizing PRL with cyclophilin B, recycling of PRLR, and increasing Ca(2+) mobilization. CAML also interacts with PRLR and is indispensable for the PRL\u2010induced activation of PRLR signalling. In addition, CAML is essential in the growth of PRL/PRLR\u2010dependent breast cancer cells.\n83\n These findings indicate that CAML is thought to be a promising target for controlling breast cancer progression.\n      \n      \n        3.4\n        Ras\u2010Raf and Ras\u2010PI3K signalling pathway\n        Prolactin can cooperate with IGF\u2010I and EGF family ligands to combine with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) on the surface of cell membrane in the absence of oestrogen, after which RTK activates two critical signalling molecules through its tyrosine kinase activity: Small G protein Ras and kinase PI3K. Next, downstream key molecule mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are jointly activated by Ras and PI3K. The activated mTOR protein promotes substrate phosphorylation and gene transcription, activates the non\u2010ligand\u2010dependent transcription activation function 1 (AF\u20101), induces phosphorylation of ER\u03b1 and promotes proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, causing endocrine therapy resistance. Ras\u2010Raf\u2010ERK1/2 pathway can also directly induce transcription.\n        \n          3.4.1\n          Ras\u2010Raf signalling pathway\n          Prolactin can initiate the phosphorylation of HER2. The study of Knuefermann et al. proved that the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway activated by HER2 plays an important role in the multidrug resistance (MDR) of breast cancer cells.\n84\n Meanwhile, PRL activates RAF by activating Ras protein. When Raf is activated, its C\u2010terminal catalytic region can combine with MEK and phosphorylate the 2 Ser kinases in the eighth subregion of its catalytic domain, activating MEK. The activated MEK directly connects with ERKs through its N\u2010terminal region, activating ERK. The ERK includes ERK1 and ERK2. The ERK1/2 activated by phosphorylation enters the cell nucleus through the cytoplasm and participates in cell proliferation and differentiation, cell carcinogenesis and other biological reactions.\n        \n        \n          3.4.2\n          Ras\u2010PI3K signalling pathway\n          As early as in 1998, Yamauchi et al. found in the cells transfected by PRLR that PRL phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS).\n85\n This is relevant to the subunit regulation of PI3K kinase, which further activates protein kinases B (PKB or AKT) as a second messenger by generating phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010phosphate (PI3P). PKB or AKT is an essential downstream molecule of PI3K, plays an essential role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival and glycose metabolism of cells and PI3K/AKT pathway can activate the downstream target protein mTOR (Figure\u00a07).\n86\n mTOR protein is an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation. The activated mTOR protein promotes the phosphorylation of key regulators in protein translation, leading to the increase of ribosomal protein synthesis. The enhancement of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is one of the causes of hormonal resistance in breast cancer. Tokunaga et al.\n87\n proved that activation of Akt is essential to induce endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer.\n          \n            FIGURE 7\n            \n              Pathway circuitry dictates therapeutic response. (A) For tumours with defined genetic lesions, the ability to overcome a given targeted therapeutic lies in whether or not they need to acquire a secondary genetic mutation to overcome the effect of the drug on critical downstream biochemical effectors that are required for continued tumour cell growth, or whether they can simply upregulate existing alternative routes that lead to effectors already expressed in those cells. So, the drug places selection pressure to ramp up existing bypass routes. If there are no such routes to the critical downstream effectors, a specific mutation to upregulate those alternative routes or bypass the drug are required. In this example, a critical target for tumour cell growth and survival is the activation of eIF4E and HIF. Tumours with initiating mutations in RTKs, Ras or Raf have multiple routes to signal to eIF4E and HIF, so blocking mTOR with rapamycin does not inhibit these tumours. (B) In contrast, tumours with initiating lesions in PI(3)K or more direct regulators of mTOR (such as LKB1 and TSC) do not have alternative routes to activate eIF4E and HIF. Hence these tumours show greater response to rapamycin. (C) Similarly, the expression and use of specific adaptor proteins that enhance certain arms of pathway signalling will dictate the therapeutic response. In the example shown, human lung tumours expressing epidermal\u2010growth\u2010factor receptor (EGFR) are targeted with anti\u2010EGFR drugs such as Iressa or Tarceva. In tumours expressing the ERBB3 heterodimerization partner, EGFR efficiently enhances PI(3)K activation through a number of PI(3)K\u2010binding sites in ERBB3. (D) In tumours that lack ERBB3, PI(3)K is still activated by a number of other routes, including adaptors such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Reprinted from [86].

Active ERK phosphorylates FAK at S910, leading to dephosphorylation of FAK at Y397 by the tyrosine phosphatase PTP\u2010PEST as shown by Zheng et al. (2009). FAK dephosphorylation decreases FAK kinase activity and promotes adhesion turnover and breast cancer cell migration. Reprinted from [92]. Copyright \u00a9 2016, BMC Cell Biology\n3.1\n        JAK/STAT pathway\n        The physiological function of PRL is mainly mediated by PRLR\u2010JAK/STAT5 signalling pathway. PRL can bind to target cells' specific transmembrane receptors and activate the receptor\u2010related Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)2. The activation of JAK can catalyse phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor. JAK kinase can recruit and phosphorylate the STAT protein on the receptor. The activated STAT protein enters the nucleus as a dimer to combine with the target gene, regulates gene transcription and increases ER transcription. PRL enhances oestrogen sensitivity, promotes tumour differentiation and reduces therapeutic sensitivity through this mechanism.\n        The conjugation of prolactin to the prolactin receptor (PRLR) activates STAT5a in the breast to facilitate the gene transcription involved in lobule development. A previous study showed that STAT5a expressed in majority of normal breast epithelial cells, but not generally in carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma, except in those secretory carcinomas that maintain STAT5a. Previous immunohistochemical studies have shown that PRLR is only expressed occasionally on the luminal surface of normal breast epithelial cells that express the STAT5a protein and in cells that express STAT5a protein and in cells that exhibit secretory changes in STAT5a expression, whether benign or malignant.\n78\n, \n79\n STAT5a and PRLR exhibit reciprocal expression patterns between normal and abnormal breast tissue. In DCIS and invasive carcinoma, reverse expression occurs in normal cells, causing an increase in PRLR and a decrease in STAT5a, which might indicate a disturbance in the signalling pathway that may be associated with carcinogenesis.\n78\n, \n79\n3.2\n        MicroRNA\u2010339\u20105p\u2010dependent pathway\n        Studies have found that micro RNA339\u20105p (miR\u2010339\u20105p) target the gene B\u2010cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and the expression of BCL6 protein was related to the breast cancer progression.\n80\n Hong Yan et al. revealed that PRL could inhibit BCL6 expression in human breast cancer cells and affect breast cancer development via the miR\u2010339\u20105p\u2010dependent pathway.\n80\n The study showed that PRL inhibited the expression of BCL6 and upregulated the expression of miR\u2010339\u20105p in breast cancer cells. PRL\u2010induced suppression of BCL6 expression was dramatically reversed by selective downregulation of miR\u2010339\u20105p expression. Exogenous PRL stimulation remarkably reduced the proliferation, colony formation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer cells, while miR\u2010339\u20105p expression's suppression reversed these processes in vitro.\n80\n3.3\n        Prolactin receptor signalling pathway\n        Calcium\u2010modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is a signalling protein recognized by the TNF receptor TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML\u2010interactor). CAML is also involved in signalling at other receptors, such as the EGFR\n81\nand mucin 1 (MUC1).\n82\n Ji\u2010Hong Lim et al. found high expression of CAML in breast cancer cells and tissues.\n83\n Moreover, CAML was found to bind to PRLR, required for PRLR function, such as activation of Stat5 and Mek1/2, internalizing PRL with cyclophilin B, recycling of PRLR, and increasing Ca(2+) mobilization. CAML also interacts with PRLR and is indispensable for the PRL\u2010induced activation of PRLR signalling. In addition, CAML is essential in the growth of PRL/PRLR\u2010dependent breast cancer cells.\n83\n These findings indicate that CAML is thought to be a promising target for controlling breast cancer progression.\n3.4\n        Ras\u2010Raf and Ras\u2010PI3K signalling pathway\n        Prolactin can cooperate with IGF\u2010I and EGF family ligands to combine with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) on the surface of cell membrane in the absence of oestrogen, after which RTK activates two critical signalling molecules through its tyrosine kinase activity: Small G protein Ras and kinase PI3K. Next, downstream key molecule mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are jointly activated by Ras and PI3K. The activated mTOR protein promotes substrate phosphorylation and gene transcription, activates the non\u2010ligand\u2010dependent transcription activation function 1 (AF\u20101), induces phosphorylation of ER\u03b1 and promotes proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, causing endocrine therapy resistance. Ras\u2010Raf\u2010ERK1/2 pathway can also directly induce transcription.\n        \n          3.4.1\n          Ras\u2010Raf signalling pathway\n          Prolactin can initiate the phosphorylation of HER2. The study of Knuefermann et al. proved that the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway activated by HER2 plays an important role in the multidrug resistance (MDR) of breast cancer cells.\n84\n Meanwhile, PRL activates RAF by activating Ras protein. When Raf is activated, its C\u2010terminal catalytic region can combine with MEK and phosphorylate the 2 Ser kinases in the eighth subregion of its catalytic domain, activating MEK. The activated MEK directly connects with ERKs through its N\u2010terminal region, activating ERK. The ERK includes ERK1 and ERK2. The ERK1/2 activated by phosphorylation enters the cell nucleus through the cytoplasm and participates in cell proliferation and differentiation, cell carcinogenesis and other biological reactions.\n        \n        \n          3.4.2\n          Ras\u2010PI3K signalling pathway\n          As early as in 1998, Yamauchi et al. found in the cells transfected by PRLR that PRL phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS).\n85\n This is relevant to the subunit regulation of PI3K kinase, which further activates protein kinases B (PKB or AKT) as a second messenger by generating phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010phosphate (PI3P). PKB or AKT is an essential downstream molecule of PI3K, plays an essential role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival and glycose metabolism of cells and PI3K/AKT pathway can activate the downstream target protein mTOR (Figure\u00a07).\n86\n mTOR protein is an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation. The activated mTOR protein promotes the phosphorylation of key regulators in protein translation, leading to the increase of ribosomal protein synthesis. The enhancement of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is one of the causes of hormonal resistance in breast cancer. Tokunaga et al.\n87\n proved that activation of Akt is essential to induce endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer.\n          \n            FIGURE 7\n            \n              Pathway circuitry dictates therapeutic response. (A) For tumours with defined genetic lesions, the ability to overcome a given targeted therapeutic lies in whether or not they need to acquire a secondary genetic mutation to overcome the effect of the drug on critical downstream biochemical effectors that are required for continued tumour cell growth, or whether they can simply upregulate existing alternative routes that lead to effectors already expressed in those cells. So, the drug places selection pressure to ramp up existing bypass routes. If there are no such routes to the critical downstream effectors, a specific mutation to upregulate those alternative routes or bypass the drug are required. In this example, a critical target for tumour cell growth and survival is the activation of eIF4E and HIF. Tumours with initiating mutations in RTKs, Ras or Raf have multiple routes to signal to eIF4E and HIF, so blocking mTOR with rapamycin does not inhibit these tumours. (B) In contrast, tumours with initiating lesions in PI(3)K or more direct regulators of mTOR (such as LKB1 and TSC) do not have alternative routes to activate eIF4E and HIF. Hence these tumours show greater response to rapamycin. (C) Similarly, the expression and use of specific adaptor proteins that enhance certain arms of pathway signalling will dictate the therapeutic response. In the example shown, human lung tumours expressing epidermal\u2010growth\u2010factor receptor (EGFR) are targeted with anti\u2010EGFR drugs such as Iressa or Tarceva. In tumours expressing the ERBB3 heterodimerization partner, EGFR efficiently enhances PI(3)K activation through a number of PI(3)K\u2010binding sites in ERBB3. (D) In tumours that lack ERBB3, PI(3)K is still activated by a number of other routes, including adaptors such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Reprinted from [86].

Copyright \u00a9 2016, BMC Cell Biology\n4\n      ADVANCES IN ENDOCRINE THERAPY RESISTANCE\n      With the proposal of more and more endocrine therapy resistance mechanisms, more drugs can be used for the treatment of endocrine resistance. For instance, the increased activity of AKT/mTOR pathways is the main mechanism of the resistance to letrozole and flurvesant; and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus can block PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Preclinical studies showed that the median overall survival (OS) in tamoxifen\u00a0+\u00a0everolimus and exemestane\u00a0+\u00a0everolimus groups is longer than that in the control group and that the combination of mTOR inhibitor and endocrine therapy can be used as a therapy for patients with aromatase inhibitor resistance.\n93\n\n\n      Cyclin\u2010dependent kinase (CKD) is a new target for treating breast cancer. CDK4 /6 inhibitor arrests cell cycle. The FDA has approved Palbociclib and ribociclib as first\u2010line therapy for advanced hormone receptor\u2010positive breast cancer. TGF\u2010\u03b2 type 2 receptor impairs the oestrogen response and gives tamoxifen resistance.\n94\n The dual inhibitors for TGF\u2010\u03b2 and MAPK are being studied. Such inhibitors may be effective in patients with endocrine therapy resistance.\n95\n Palbociclib combined with fulvestrant is an effective therapy for endocrine resistance in advanced premenopausal breast cancer (HR+/HER2\u2212).\n96\n, \n97\n The US Food and Drug Administration has approved fulvestrant for treating metastatic breast cancer in hormone receptor\u2010positive postmenopausal women with disease progression after anti\u2010oestrogen therapy.\n98\n The BELLA\u20102 study showed that postmenopausal women who developed disease progression during or after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for HR\u2010positive/HER2\u2010negative advanced breast cancer had a significant improvement in PFS in patients after buparlisib plus fulvestrant.\n99\n Similarly, the phase III BELLA\u20103 study showed that buparlisib plus fulvestrant improved PFS in HR\u2010positive, HER2\u2010negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients who progressed after being treated with everolimus plus exemestane.\n100\n HDAC inhibitors are also potential drugs to reverse endocrine resistance in HR\u2010positive breast cancer. Entinostat is an oral selective HDAC inhibitor that restores patients' sensitivity to AIs by upregulating ER receptor and aromatase enzyme levels.\n101\n The phase II ENCORE 301 study has shown that entinostat plus exemestane improved PFS and OS vs exemestane monotherapy in postmenopausal patients with HR\u2010positive advanced breast cancer and prior non\u2010steroidal AI therapy progression.\n102\n\n\n      PRL can induces PAK1. As a common PRL and oestradiol (E2) pathway, PAK1 cooperates with ER to stimulate tumour cell metastasis, inducing tamoxifen resistance. Argentine Molecular Oncology Laboratory has developed specific Rac1 inhibitor 1A\u2010116, which inhibits the activity of PAK1 and restores the drug sensitivity of tamoxifen\u2010resistant cells.\n103\n Studies showed that the reduction of EGR1 protein level can cooperate with anti\u2010oestrogen to inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells; and EGR1 is expected to be an important target to prevent or reverse endocrine resistance.\n104\n\n\n      The PRL secreted by breast cells cannot be controlled by the dopamine agonist acting on the pituitary gland level. It is necessary to develop a particular type of drug to block PRLR to reduce endogenous PRL. Howell et al.\n105\n discovered that PRLR antagonist \u03941\u20139\u2010G129R\u2010hPrl hinders the activation of PRLR, which promotes the apoptosis of ER+ and ER\u2212 breast cancer cells, increases the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel in vitro. They also proposed that the reasonable combination of cytotoxic drugs and \u03941\u20139\u2010G129R\u2010hPrl can improve the therapeutic effect. American Huntsman Institute found, in the treatment of 73 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) or metastatic castrate\u2010resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with LFA102 generated with PRLR inhibitor and monoclonal antibody, that LFA102 showed no antitumour activity as a monotherapy.\n106\n\n\n      Studies showed that the new PRLR antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) rapidly release the cytotoxic drugs carried by ADCs into the intracellular lysosomes; and the active drugs released can also infiltrate from target cells into adjacent antigen\u2010negative cells, which may cause the so\u2010called bystander killing. The results showed that ADCs have antitumour activity in vivo and in vitro.\n107\n Some recently completed and ongoing clinical trials on breast cancer treatment targeting prolactin and its receptors

Therefore, inhibiting PRL can enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to drugs. However, there are no clinical data on whether the reduction of PRL level affects the patients with endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Currently, PRL targeted therapies are still at the experimental stage and face many challenges before real clinical application. Therefore, keep exploring the role of PRL and its targeted therapies in the mechanism of endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer plays a significant role in its becoming a method to overcome endocrine therapy resistance clinically. It is likely to become a very promising new therapeutic target for endocrine therapy for breast cancer.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n      \nYuan Li: Writing\u2010original draft (equal).
