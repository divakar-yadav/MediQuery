    "description": "Background\n          Reproductive factors have been shown to be differentially associated with risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. However, their associations with intrinsic-like subtypes are less clear.\nMethods\n          Analyses included up to 23\u200a353 cases and 71\u200a072 controls pooled from 31 population-based case-control or cohort studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium across 16 countries on 4 continents. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate the association between reproductive factors and risk of breast cancer by intrinsic-like subtypes (luminal A-like, luminal B-like, luminal B-HER2\u2013like, HER2-enriched\u2013like, and triple-negative breast cancer) and by invasiveness. All statistical tests were 2-sided.\nResults\n          Compared with nulliparous women, parous women had a lower risk of luminal A-like, luminal B-like, luminal B-HER2\u2013like, and HER2-enriched\u2013like disease. This association was apparent only after approximately 10\u2009years since last birth and became stronger with increasing time (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49 to 0.71; and OR\u2009=\u20090.36, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.28 to 0.46 for multiparous women with luminal A-like tumors 20 to less than 25\u2009years after last birth and 45 to less than 50\u2009years after last birth, respectively). In contrast, parous women had a higher risk of triple-negative breast cancer right after their last birth (for multiparous women: OR\u2009=\u20093.12, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.02 to 4.83) that was attenuated with time but persisted for decades (OR\u2009=\u20091.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.79 to 1.34, for multiparous women 25 to less than 30\u2009years after last birth). Older age at first birth (Pheterogeneity < .001 for triple-negative compared with luminal A-like breast cancer) and breastfeeding (Pheterogeneity < .001 for triple-negative compared with luminal A-like breast cancer) were associated with lower risk of triple-negative breast cancer but not with other disease subtypes. Younger age at menarche was associated with higher risk of all subtypes; older age at menopause was associated with higher risk of luminal A-like but not triple-negative breast cancer. Associations for in situ tumors were similar to luminal A-like.\nConclusions\n          This large and comprehensive study demonstrates a distinct reproductive risk factor profile for triple-negative breast cancer compared with other subtypes, with implications for the understanding of disease etiology and risk prediction.",
