    "abstract": "We have performed Shapiro\u2010Wilk test for each group of the raw data (including Dmean, D2%, D50%, D98%, V95%, V105%, CI and HI of PTV, Dmean, V5\u00a0Gy, V10\u00a0Gy, and V20\u00a0Gy of Heart, Dmean, V5\u00a0Gy, V10\u00a0Gy, and V20\u00a0Gy of Left Lung, Dmean of Right Breast, Dmax of Spinal Cord) and found that they are of the Gaussian distribution. 1 Given the heart irradiation leading to the subsequent increasing risk of life\u2010threatening major cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic cardiac disease, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and the nature of lack of a threshold value, their long\u2010term, dosage\u2010related effect as well as the additive nature of the risk with preexisting cardiac diseases, 8 heart radiation exposure should be used as an a priori limitation parameter to evaluate which of the radiotherapy plans for left\u2010sided breast cancer after modified radical mastectomy is more advantageous if PTV dose coverage and other OARs sparing are acceptable. In our study, we measured the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement 13 , 14 attributed to respiratory movement by defining nine points on the left chest wall and quantifying their displacement by using the 4D CT. We than measured the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement resulting from the integrated effect of respiratory movement, thoracic disformation and setup errors by using the on\u2010board cone beam CT. Interestingly, we found that the CTV displacement in post modified radical mastectomy intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy predominantly arises from inter\u2010fraction rather than from intra\u2010fraction during natural breathing, and differs in three directions either inter\u2010fractionally or intra\u2010fractionally.",

    "description": "Purpose\n          Our study aimed to improve the dosimetry of post modified radical mastectomy intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy (PMRM\u2010IMRT) for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients by tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally utilizing 4D CT combined with on\u2010board cone beam CT (CBCT).\nMethods\n          We enrolled a total of 10 consecutive left\u2010sided breast cancer patients to undergo PMRM\u2010IMRT. We measured the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement by defining 9 points on the left chest wall and quantifying their displacement by using the 4D CT, and measured the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement resulting from the integrated effect of respiratory movement, thoracic deformation and set up errors by using CBCT. We created 3 different PMRM\u2010IMRT plans for each of the patients using PTVt (tailored PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally), PTV0.5 and PTV0.7 (isotropic 0.5\u2010 cm and isotropic 0.7\u2010 cm expanding margin of CTV), respectively. We performed paired samples t test to establish a hierarchy in terms of plan quality and dosimetric benefits. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.\n3\n      RESULTS\n      The intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement in PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients measured by 4D CT during natural respiration.\n      The overall intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement measured by 4D CT simulation differed in three directions, with 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mm vertically, 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0mm longitudinally, and 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mm laterally, respectively. As exhibited in Table\u00a01, the result indicated that the lower and lateral part of the chest wall tends to have a larger range of displacement than the upper and middle one during natural breathing. Either the displacement in y direction or in z direction was larger than in x direction during natural respiration (Table\u00a01).\n      \n        Table 1\n        \n          The intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement in PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer measured by 4D CT.\n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              Paramaters\n              X (mm)\n              Y (mm)\n              Z (mm)\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              A1\n              0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\n              0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\n              0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n            \n            \n              A2\n              0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n            \n            \n              A3\n              0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\n              0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\n              0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\n            \n            \n              B1\n              0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\n              0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\n            \n            \n              B2\n              0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\n              0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\n            \n            \n              B3\n              0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\n              0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\n            \n            \n              C1\n              0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\n              0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\n              0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\n            \n            \n              C2\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\n              0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\n            \n            \n              C3\n              0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\n              0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            The intersection points (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3) of the three lateral and the three longitudinal lines were marked with ink and radiopaque metal beads on the surface of the left chest wall.

The respiratory gating technics was not recommended to be applied in PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer during natural breathing. Tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally based on inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement can significantly improve the dosimetry of PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients under this respiratory paradigm.\n1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Our previous study had demonstrated that intensity\u2010modulated radiation therapy has dosimetrical advantages over three\u2010dimensional conformal radiotherapy with field\u2010in\u2010field technique (3DCRT\u2010FinF) and 2\u2010 partial arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (2P\u2010VMAT) for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients after modified radical mastectomy, and suggested that individually quantifying and minimizing CTV displacement might improve target dose coverage and heart and left lung sparing.\n1\n Given the heart irradiation leading to the subsequent increasing risk of life\u2010threatening major cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic cardiac disease,\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n and the nature of lack of a threshold value, their long\u2010term, dosage\u2010related effect as well as the additive nature of the risk with preexisting cardiac diseases,\n8\n heart radiation exposure should be used as an a priori limitation parameter to evaluate which of the radiotherapy plans for left\u2010sided breast cancer after modified radical mastectomy is more advantageous if PTV dose coverage and other OARs sparing are acceptable.\n1\n Our study aimed to verify the dosimetry improvement of post modified radical mastectomy intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy (PMRM\u2010IMRT) for the patients by tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally utilizing four\u2010dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) simulation combined with on\u2010board cone beam CT (CBCT) verification under natural respiration.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      We enrolled a total of 10 left\u2010sided breast cancer patients undergoing IMRT after modified radical mastectomy in this study. Based on the contouring atlas published by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG),\n9\n we delineated CTV including left chest wall and ipsilateral lymph node drainage area. A prescribed dose of 50\u00a0Gy/5w/25f was delivered to PTV. Each patient had 4D CT simulation before radiotherapy and three times of on\u2010board cone beam CT verification inter\u2010fractionally during the treatment. The intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement was measured by the 4D CT. The inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement resulting from the integrated effect of respiratory movement, thoracic disformation and setup errors was measured by the on\u2010board cone beam CT.\n      The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Informed consent form was obtained from each patient.\n      \n        2.A\n        4D CT simulation\n        Each patient was placed in a supine position. Three lateral lines (labeled with 1, 2, and 3) were marked on the surface of the left chest wall using laser projecting across the lower edge of bilateral sternal heads, right nipple and the skinfold of the lower edge of the right breast, respectively. The other three longitudinal lines (named A, B, and C) were labeled across the left edge of the sternum, left mid\u2010clavicular line and left anterior axillary, respectively. The intersection points (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3) of the three lateral and the three longitudinal lines were marked with ink and radiopaque metal beads on the surface of the left chest wall. The position changes of A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3 points measured by 4D CT were documented to reflect the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement. For each patient, a helical CT scan was acquired under natural breathing followed by 4D CT scans taken at a representative normal respiratory cycle using a Philips Brilliance CT Big Bore Simulation System (Andover, MA). The respiratory signal was recorded with the Real\u2010Time Position Management (RPM) Respiratory Gating System (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA) and synchronized with the CT data. The slice thickness was 3\u00a0mm at 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 pixels. Each image acquired and tagged to its corresponding phase of the respiratory cycle was then sent to the workstation using the 4D CT software. The position changes of A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3 points were documented to reflect the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement. X, Y, and Z values indicated the displacement of the intersection points in x (laterally), in y (longitudinally) and in z coordinate axis (vertically), respectively.\n      \n      \n        2.B\n        3D on\u2010board cone beam CT verification\n        Each patient had a total of three times of on\u2010board cone beam CT verification inter\u2010fractionally randomly during the treatment. The CBCT scans were performed using the on\u2010board imager system installed on the Varian TrueBeam linac (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Under the half\u2010fan scan mode (field of view\u00a0=\u00a046\u00a0cm), the detector is centered laterally and longitudinally with respect to the source. The CBCT protocols used 1080\u00a0mAs at 125\u00a0kV with weighted CT dose index (CTDIw) of 1.60\u00a0Gy. The CBCT image acquired in half\u2010fan mode and reconstructed using manufacturer\u2019s software. Patient position shifts in x, y, and z directions were documented after manually matching the radiopaque markers (the sternum and the labeled metal beads on the chest wall) between their initial simulation position and the present on\u2010board position.\n      \n      \n        2.C\n        Plan comparison and statistical analysis\n        We created three different PMRM\u2010IMRT plans for each of the patients using the PTVt (tailored PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally), PTV0.5 and PTV0.7 (isotropic 0.5\u2010cm and isotropic 0.7\u2010cm expanding margin of CTV), respectively. All PMRM\u2010IMRT plans used two opposed tangential beams, and two anterior beams with a 10\u2010degree angle from the tangential ones, and a supraclavicular beam. The dose calculations were employed with a grid of 2.5\u00a0mm using the Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA). All plans were created with a prescribed dose of 50\u00a0Gy covering 95% of the PTV.\n        Clinical target volume (CTV) and OARs including heart, ipsilateral lung, spinal cord, and contralateral breast were contoured as previously\n1\n using the Eclipse treatment planning system (Eclipse 10.0, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Dmean, V95%, V105%, heterogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) values were calculated for the PTV. V95% was defined as the percentage of the PTV receiving 95% or more of the prescription dose. V105% indicated the dose hotspot area that received 105% of the prescription dose. The heterogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) were calculated as followed: HI\u00a0=\u00a0(D2%\u2013D98%)/D50%, CI\u00a0=\u00a0(VPTVref/VPTV)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(VPTVref/Vref), where VPTVref represents the volume of PTV covered with the reference dose. VPTV represents the volume of PTV and Vref represents the volume covered with the reference dose or higher. A lower HI value, ranging from 0 to 1, represents better homogeneity. A lower CI value, ranging from 0 to 1, represents worse conformity. Dmean is an average dose delivering to an organ. V(xGy) represents the percentage of an organ\u2019s volume receiving (x) Gy or higher. D2% represented the dose corresponding to 2% PTV volume as shown in the dose volume histogram (DVH) and could be deemed as the maximum dose, whereas D98% could be deemed as the minimum dose. D50% represented the reference dose (or prescription dose) for PTV. Dmean, V5\u00a0Gy, V10\u00a0Gy, and V20\u00a0Gy were calculated for the heart and the left lung. We performed paired samples t test between any two of the three plans, to establish a hierarchy in terms of plan quality and dosimetric benefits. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered statistically significant. The SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical data management and analysis. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.\n2.A\n        4D CT simulation\n        Each patient was placed in a supine position. Three lateral lines (labeled with 1, 2, and 3) were marked on the surface of the left chest wall using laser projecting across the lower edge of bilateral sternal heads, right nipple and the skinfold of the lower edge of the right breast, respectively. The other three longitudinal lines (named A, B, and C) were labeled across the left edge of the sternum, left mid\u2010clavicular line and left anterior axillary, respectively. The intersection points (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3) of the three lateral and the three longitudinal lines were marked with ink and radiopaque metal beads on the surface of the left chest wall. The position changes of A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3 points measured by 4D CT were documented to reflect the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement. For each patient, a helical CT scan was acquired under natural breathing followed by 4D CT scans taken at a representative normal respiratory cycle using a Philips Brilliance CT Big Bore Simulation System (Andover, MA). The respiratory signal was recorded with the Real\u2010Time Position Management (RPM) Respiratory Gating System (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA) and synchronized with the CT data. The slice thickness was 3\u00a0mm at 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 pixels. Each image acquired and tagged to its corresponding phase of the respiratory cycle was then sent to the workstation using the 4D CT software. The position changes of A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3 points were documented to reflect the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement. X, Y, and Z values indicated the displacement of the intersection points in x (laterally), in y (longitudinally) and in z coordinate axis (vertically), respectively.\n2.B\n        3D on\u2010board cone beam CT verification\n        Each patient had a total of three times of on\u2010board cone beam CT verification inter\u2010fractionally randomly during the treatment. The CBCT scans were performed using the on\u2010board imager system installed on the Varian TrueBeam linac (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Under the half\u2010fan scan mode (field of view\u00a0=\u00a046\u00a0cm), the detector is centered laterally and longitudinally with respect to the source. The CBCT protocols used 1080\u00a0mAs at 125\u00a0kV with weighted CT dose index (CTDIw) of 1.60\u00a0Gy. The CBCT image acquired in half\u2010fan mode and reconstructed using manufacturer\u2019s software. Patient position shifts in x, y, and z directions were documented after manually matching the radiopaque markers (the sternum and the labeled metal beads on the chest wall) between their initial simulation position and the present on\u2010board position.\n2.C\n        Plan comparison and statistical analysis\n        We created three different PMRM\u2010IMRT plans for each of the patients using the PTVt (tailored PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally), PTV0.5 and PTV0.7 (isotropic 0.5\u2010cm and isotropic 0.7\u2010cm expanding margin of CTV), respectively. All PMRM\u2010IMRT plans used two opposed tangential beams, and two anterior beams with a 10\u2010degree angle from the tangential ones, and a supraclavicular beam. The dose calculations were employed with a grid of 2.5\u00a0mm using the Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA). All plans were created with a prescribed dose of 50\u00a0Gy covering 95% of the PTV.\n        Clinical target volume (CTV) and OARs including heart, ipsilateral lung, spinal cord, and contralateral breast were contoured as previously\n1\n using the Eclipse treatment planning system (Eclipse 10.0, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Dmean, V95%, V105%, heterogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) values were calculated for the PTV. V95% was defined as the percentage of the PTV receiving 95% or more of the prescription dose. V105% indicated the dose hotspot area that received 105% of the prescription dose. The heterogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) were calculated as followed: HI\u00a0=\u00a0(D2%\u2013D98%)/D50%, CI\u00a0=\u00a0(VPTVref/VPTV)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(VPTVref/Vref), where VPTVref represents the volume of PTV covered with the reference dose. VPTV represents the volume of PTV and Vref represents the volume covered with the reference dose or higher. A lower HI value, ranging from 0 to 1, represents better homogeneity. A lower CI value, ranging from 0 to 1, represents worse conformity. Dmean is an average dose delivering to an organ. V(xGy) represents the percentage of an organ\u2019s volume receiving (x) Gy or higher. D2% represented the dose corresponding to 2% PTV volume as shown in the dose volume histogram (DVH) and could be deemed as the maximum dose, whereas D98% could be deemed as the minimum dose. D50% represented the reference dose (or prescription dose) for PTV. Dmean, V5\u00a0Gy, V10\u00a0Gy, and V20\u00a0Gy were calculated for the heart and the left lung. We performed paired samples t test between any two of the three plans, to establish a hierarchy in terms of plan quality and dosimetric benefits. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered statistically significant. The SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical data management and analysis. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.\n4\n      DISCUSSION\n      Increasing PTV expansion in post modified radical mastectomy intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy (PMRM\u2010IMRT) for left\u2010sided breast cancer incredibly leads to the increasing radiation exposure of heart and left lung, which leads to the increasing risk of the long\u2010term radiation injury correspondingly.\n2\n, \n5\n, \n8\n, \n10\n, \n11\n Considering setup and respiration motion uncertainties, either an isotropic 0.7\u2010cm or an 0.5\u2010cm expanding margin of CTV was referred to as an \u201capproximate value\u201d in published study\n12\n and should not serve as the golden standard of PTV expansion for all patients. The CTV displacement could differ significantly among different individuals, among women in different treatment systems, among different phases of a respiratory cycle and among three different dimensional directions within the same patient. Such differences probably cannot be clinically neglected. Moreover, the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement could be quite different in different treatment systems. More accurately quantifying and minimizing CTV displacement could potentially improve the dose distribution.\n      In our study, we measured the intra\u2010fractional CTV displacement\n13\n, \n14\n attributed to respiratory movement by defining nine points on the left chest wall and quantifying their displacement by using the 4D CT. We than measured the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement resulting from the integrated effect of respiratory movement, thoracic disformation and setup errors by using the on\u2010board cone beam CT. Interestingly, we found that the CTV displacement in post modified radical mastectomy intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy predominantly arises from inter\u2010fraction rather than from intra\u2010fraction during natural breathing, and differs in three directions either inter\u2010fractionally or intra\u2010fractionally. Tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally based on inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement significantly improves the dosimetry of PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients.\n      Clinical target volume displacement could be repeatedly quantified intra\u2010fractionally by 4D CT. Inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement could be repeatedly quantified by CBCT. The inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement attributed to the mixed effect of respiratory movement, thoracic disformation and setup errors, measured by on board cone beam CT was much larger than the displacement in the intra\u2010fraction and also differed in three dimensions under natural breathing, with 1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0mm in x direction, 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0mm in y direction, and 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0mm in z direction, respectively. Evidently, the PTV expansion of post modified radical mastectomy intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy (PMRM\u2010IMRT) for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients should be based on the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement rather than the intra\u2010fractional one during natural breathing. Therefore, we could not obtain respiration\u2010induced CTV displacement\u2010related dosimetric benefit when the real\u2010time respiratory gating technics, one of the most effective approaches to minimize radiation dose delivery to normal tissue and maximize delivery to tumors under patient's motion caused by respiration,\n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n was applied to PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients under natural breathing paradigm.\n      We expanded CTV 3\u00a0mm in x, 4\u00a0mm in y, and 4\u00a0mm in z direction (the average value of the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement without correction or optimization) to generate PTVt and created the corresponding IMRT plans. Our results indicate that PMRM\u2010IMRT plans for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients with PTVt has dosimetrical advantages compared with plans with PTV0.5 and those with PTV0.7. given its perfect PTV coverage and better heart and left lung sparing. Additionally, the PMRM\u2010IMRT plans with PTV0.5 has dosimetrical advantages compared with plans with PTV0.7. owing to their better OARs sparing. Collectively, our data supported that tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three\u2010dimensionally significantly improves the dosimetry of PMRM\u2010IMRT for left\u2010sided breast cancer patients.\n      Nevertheless, the average tailored PTV expansion without correction only covered 93.3% of all CTV in x, 63.3% in y, and 66.6% in z direction. To reach better CTV target coverage without increasing the expansion value when applying to clinical practice, we could do a successive of 3D on board cone beam CT verification and position correction inter\u2010fractionally at the first 2\u00a0weeks of radiotherapy for each patient, until the inter\u2010fractional CTV displacement was stably and repeatably less than the \u201ctailored PTV expansion\u201d value three\u2010dimensionally. Modality with more individualized tailored or minimized PTV expansion and the availability based on the displacement quantifying of the different parts of the chest wall, as well as the corresponding techniques applied in deep breathing\n18\n warranted further study.\nETHICAL DECLARATIONS\n      The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College.
