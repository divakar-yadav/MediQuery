Only North American patients (6,827 of 7,576 of MA.27 accrual) were offered participation in the collection of blood specimens, and 5,221 of the North American patients contributed blood and gave consent for genetic testing. This research was approved by health regulatory authorities and the institutional review boards of participating centers.\n        Genotyping was performed in three cohorts as detailed in Supplementary Material.\n14\n, \n16\n, \n17\n For the current analysis, we restricted the studies to the White only population that included 4,465 patients with 245 breast events: 2,226 patients on the anastrozole arm with 121 breast events, and 2,239 patients on the exemestane arm with 124 breast events. African American and Han Chinese cohorts had nine breast events in the combined exemestane and anastrozole cohorts.

Statistical significance level is 0.05.\nRESULTS\n      \n        Genetic variation interaction with aromatase inhibitor therapy\n        The Participant Flow Diagram for the MA.27 trial (Figure\u00a0\n\nS1\n) shows the patients included in the SNP\u2010treatment interaction studies. The analysis cohort was restricted to 4,465 White patients (2,226 patients treated with anastrozole and 2,239 patients treated with exemestane, with 121 and 124 breast events in each arm). To determine the possible SNP\u2010treatment interaction effect using the MA.27 cohort, we performed a stratified Cox\u2010proportional hazard analysis utilizing stratification factors and other covariates as detailed in the Methods section. The Manhattan plot (Figure\u00a0\n\n1a\n) shows the results of SNP\u2010treatment interaction analyses for BCFI, and the quantile\u2010quantile plot (Figure\u00a0\n\nS2\n\nA) revealed a lambda of 1.025. Although none of these SNPs met the criteria for genomewide significance, we had used the largest sample set available to perform the GWAS, so we chose to pursue the results functionally and mechanistically. The results of those studies supported the novel insights that are described subsequently regarding genetic mechanisms for variation in AI effect.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            SNP treatment interaction analysis.

BCFI, Breast Cancer Free Interval; GWAS, genomewide association studies; HR, hazard ratio; MAF, Minor Allele Frequency; SNP, single\u2010nucleotide polymorphism.\n          \n          \n        \n        \nTable\u00a0\n\nS1\n presents the 887 significant SNP\u2010by\u2010drug interactions (P\u00a0<\u00a01.0E\u201004) on BCFI when comparing exemestane to anastrozole. Signals with an Exemestane/Anastrozole hazard ratio (HR) of >\u00a01 indicate that patients carrying a variant SNP genotype have reduced efficacy when treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole. On the contrary, signals with an Exemestane/Anastrozole HR of <\u00a01, indicate that patients carrying a variant SNP genotype have a better outcome when treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole. We next investigated these 887 SNPs for their associations with anastrozole (Figure\u00a0\n\n1b\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS2\n\nB) and exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n1c\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS2\n\nC) efficacy (BCFI) separately based on GWAS conducted within each treatment arm in the MA.27 study. One hundred thirty\u2010four of 887 SNPs (Figure\u00a0\n\n1d\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS2\n) were associated with better outcomes (longer BCFI) in exemestane\u2010treated patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.04~0.71, P\u00a0=\u00a02.21E\u201004~0.009), but with shorter BCFI in anastrozole\u2010treated patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.42~3.43, P\u00a0=\u00a06.36E\u201005~0.0097). One hundred twenty\u2010seven of 887 SNPs (Figure\u00a0\n\n1d\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS2\n) were associated with shorter BCFI in exemestane\u2010treated patients (HR=1.41~2.94, P\u00a0=\u00a02.21E\u201004~0.0099), but with longer BCFI in anastrozole\u2010treated patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.01~0.68, P\u00a0=\u00a01.99E\u201005~0.0095). However, these two groups of SNPs (134\u00a0+\u00a0127\u00a0=\u00a0261 SNPs; Figure\u00a0\n\n1e\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS3\n\nA) showed no association with BCFI in the combined analysis of anastrozole and exemestane (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.90~1.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08~0.99) based on our previous published GWAS results for the MA.27 trial.\n14\n\nFigure\u00a0\n\n1e\n plots 3 sets of ordered HRs of 261 SNPs from 3 GWASs; the whole cohort (red), patients who received anastrozole (green), and patients who received exemestane (blue). In the left half of the plot, SNPs whose HRs range from 0 to 1 in exemestane cohort have an HR ranging from 1 to 3 in the anastrozole cohort implying the presence of minor alleles in these SNPs will be protective if treated with exemestane as compared to anastrozole. Similarly, in the right half of the plot, we see a set of SNPs whose HRs suggest being protective alleles for anastrozole and risk alleles for exemestane. HRs obtained from the whole cohort remained constant around one, suggesting low power to detect any SNP effect. In summary, the current analyses revealed a difference in anastrozole and exemestane efficacy in the context of the host genome and identified germline genetic variants that might be able to identify which AI might be superior in preventing breast cancer recurrence in that specific patient. Importantly, over 98.7% of the signals (876 of 887 SNPs) were lost (P\u00a0>\u00a00.01) in the GWAS analysis when anastrozole and exemestane were combined. Moreover, 261 SNPs were observed to be risk alleles for one AI and protective for the other (Figure\u00a0\n\n1e\n).\n      \n      \n        Genetic model for guiding aromatase inhibitor selection\n        We next set out to build a genetic model for guiding AI selection. Of the 261 SNPs, 105 SNPs marginally affected BCFI based on any of the clinical covariates and were removed from further analysis. After filtering the 105 SNPs, the remaining 156 SNPs underwent linkage disequilibrium (LD) \u2013clumping analyses.\n22\n In brief, \u201cclumping\u201d reported the SNPs that were within 500\u00a0kb of the significant SNP, were in high LD (r\n2\u00a0>\u00a00.8), and had a low P value. For anastrozole and exemestane cohorts, we chose a P value cutoff <\u00a00. 001, and for the interaction GWAS analysis, we chose a P value cutoff <\u00a09.99E\u201005. From the clumping analysis for each study, we obtained a set of SNPs that were common and unique to each study, as shown in Figure\u00a0\n\n1f\n and Table\u00a0\n\n1\n. Coincidentally, the number of SNPs remaining after clumping was 46 for all 3 studies. As shown in the Venn diagram, we overlapped the SNP IDs from the three studies after clumping to identify a reduced list of SNPs that were significantly associated with anastrozole and with exemestane. Thirty\u2010two SNPs were retained after clumping in all the 3 studies, 14 of those SNPs were present in 2 or more studies (interaction and anastrozole or interaction and exemestane LD analysis), 8 SNPs were unique to exemestane only, and 6 SNPs were retained in the anastrozole only clumping analysis, as shown in Table\u00a0\n\nS3\n. We ultimately obtained a list of 60 unique SNPs (32\u00a0+\u00a014\u00a0+\u00a08\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0=\u00a060) as our SNP panel. Note that these SNPs had been obtained from a pure discovery activity and had not been tested or validated in an independent set.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are particularly useful for annotating variants associated with complex traits.\n23\n We, therefore, determined whether any of the 261 SNPs were eQTL SNPs using the Genotype\u2010Tissue Expression (GTEx) website.\n24\n Cis\u2010eQTL analysis identified 46 SNPs that were eQTLs with 2 genes in breast tissue, and an additional 4 genes in other tissues (Table\u00a0\n\nS4\n). Collectively, the eQTL analysis identified six \u201ceGenes\u201d (genes exhibiting association with genotypes for at least one SNP). The SNPs associated with any given gene were in high LD with each other, with pairwise correlation r\n2 = 1.\n        We then investigated which SNP\u2010eGenes were differentially associated with efficacy for anastrozole and exemestane. We took advantage of cell lines selected on the basis of each of the 6 eQTL SNP genotypes from a genomic data\u2010rich panel of 300 human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that has proven to be a powerful tool for testing pharmacogenomic hypotheses.\n15\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n We selected four LCLs with homozygous WT genotypes for each SNP and four LCLs with the variant genotypes with detectable aromatase expression (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n\na) to test the impact of anastrozole and exemestane on cell growth. We ensured that the aromatase activity was inhibited by anastrozole and exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n\nb). The eQTL SNPs for the following genes, LY75, GPR160, PLA2R1, NPLOC4, and NT5C3A, showed that the variant genotypes all had a differential effect on cell growth between exemestane and anastrozole (Figure\u00a0\n\n2a\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n\nc). Among these five eQTL relationships, three were not consistent with our analysis results. The directional effect of the eQTL SNPs for NT5C3A on individual drug efficacy identified through SNP\u2010drug interaction GWAS was not consistent with experimental results (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS1\n). As for the NPLOC4 SNPs, anastrozole, in comparison to exemestane, had greater growth inhibition on cells with variant SNP genotypes, which was consistent with the SNP\u2010drug interaction GWAS results (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)\u00a0=\u00a00.037, HR: Anas vs. Exem\u00a0=\u00a00). However, the anastrozole to exemestane HR was 0 due to the low MAF, resulting in low statistical power,\n30\n, \n31\n raising the possibility that the association might be a false positive. Indeed, regardless of the NPLOC4 SNP genotype, cells grew faster in the presence of exemestane compared with anastrozole (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n). The eQTL SNPs for LY75 (lymphocyte antigen 75), GPR160 (G Protein\u2010Coupled Receptor 160), and PLA2R1 (Phospholipase A2 Receptor 1) showed a consistent effect on drug response between GWAS result and the experimental validation (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n, Figure\u00a0\n\n2a\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS1\n), suggesting that these SNPs may differentially affect anastrozole and exemestane response through regulation of the LY75, GPR160, and PLA2R1 genes. We sought to study the functional impact of LY75, GPR160, and PLA2R1 genes, which are expressed in breast tissue (Figure\u00a0\n\nS5\n). Knockdown of LY75 and GPR160, but not PLA2R1, decreased breast cancer cell proliferation (Figure\u00a0\n\n2b,c\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS6\n\na). We then validated the interaction effects of these three genes with AIs. LY75 and GPR160, but not PLA2R1, knockdown cells grew more slowly in the presence of anastrozole compared to exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n2d,e\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS6\n\nb). Therefore, we chose to focus on the functional implications of the LY75 and GPR160 SNPs because those SNPs may represent regulatory variants.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            \nLY75 and GPR160 SNPs dependent effect on cell proliferation.

These 2 SNPs mapped upstream of LY75 on chromosome 2 (Figure\u00a0\n\n3a,b\n) and had significant interaction with treatments (SNP rs1877193: HR: Exe/Ana\u00a0=\u00a00.45; SNP rs6735923: HR: Exe/Ana\u00a0=\u00a00.46; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n), indicating ~\u00a055% reduction in the hazard for a breast cancer event for patients carrying the variant genotype treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole. In treatment\u2010specific cohort GWAS analysis, the two SNPs were associated with opposite effects on risk for a breast event between the two treatment cohorts: increased risk in the anastrozole cohort (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.57, 1.58; P\u00a0=\u00a05.3E\u201004, 6.9E\u201004), and decreased risk in the exemestane cohort (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.70, 0.71; P\u00a0=\u00a06.0E\u201003, 8.0E\u201003). However, the two SNPs showed no association with breast events if the two treatment arms were combined\n14\n (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.07, 1.08; P\u00a0=\u00a00.37, 0.40; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            \nLY75 SNP\u2010 and anastrozole\u2010dependent gene regulation.

The minor allele (MAF\u00a0=\u00a00.338) was associated with decreased risk for breast events when treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole (HR: Exe/Ana\u00a0=\u00a00.43; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n). This effect was also confirmed by independent GWAS analysis in each treatment arm, in that a trend for increased risk of a breast event within the anastrozole arm (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.39, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014), and for significantly decreased risk within the exemestane arm (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.58, P\u00a0=\u00a02.0E\u201004) were observed (Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n). Similar to the LY75 SNPs, rs62293499 was not associated with breast events when the two treatment arms were combined (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.92, P\u00a0=\u00a00.39; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n).\n      \n      \n        LY75 SNP effects differ in the presence of anastrozole vs. exemestane\n        We next set out to determine whether and how the LY75 SNPs might have a differential impact on response to the two AIs through LY75. We selected LCLs with WT and variant genotypes for LY75 SNPs, and then exposed them to an AI in the presence of androstenedione, a precursor of estrogen. The variant cell lines showed a reduction of LY75 expression in response to androstenedione exposure, whereas WT LCLs did not (Figure\u00a0\n\n3c,d\n). Addition of anastrozole showed a striking reversal of the LY75 expression pattern in LCLs with variant SNP genotypes: LY75 expression increased almost threefold with the addition of anastrozole. In contrast, WT expression did not change (Figure\u00a0\n\n3c\n). Of importance, exemestane did not change the expression patterns of LY75 in either WT or variant genotype LCLs (Figure\u00a0\n\n3d\n).\n      \n      \n        Anastrozole, but not exemestane, regulates LY75 SNP\u2010dependent ER\u03b1/ERE binding\n        To determine whether the SNP\u2010 and AI\u2010dependent LY75 gene regulation was mediated by ER\u03b1, we first identified two EREs; 2 bp overlap with each other) located ~\u00a0200 bp distant from the LY75 SNP rs1877193 based on ENCODE data (Figure\u00a0\n\n3e\n). We then performed ChIP assays with ER\u03b1 antibody and found that the rs1877193 SNP (Figure\u00a0\n\n3f\n) showed striking differential binding to the ERE that was located closest to the SNP, with greater binding for the variant SNP genotype in the presence of androstenedione, but less binding when additional anastrozole was present. However, this differential binding pattern was not detected after exemestane treatment (Figure\u00a0\n\n3f\n). LY75 expression was reduced whereas ER\u03b1/ERE binding increased in cells with the variant genotypes in response to androstenedione exposure, suggesting that ER\u03b1 functions as a transcription repressor of LY75. Indeed, LY75 expression increased when ESR1 was knocked down (Figure\u00a0\n\n3g\n). These results were compatible with our SNP\u2010treatment interaction analysis results in that variant LY75 SNP genotypes could differentiate anastrozole from exemestane in the risk for a breast event during 5\u00a0years of AI therapy for those enrolled in MA.27.\n        Finally, to determine whether the differences in binding shown in Figure\u00a0\n\n3f\n might have functional consequences; we created reporter gene constructs that included ~\u00a01.1 kb of the LY75 promoter with WT and variant genotypes for the rs1877193 SNP. These reporter gene constructs were then transfected into different cell lines to compare LY75 transcriptional activities for WT and variant SNP genotypes in those cells. within the presence of androstenedione, cells transfected with the variant construct showed higher LY75 transcriptional activity than did cells transfected with the WT construct. However, when the cells were incubated with the addition of 100 nM anastrozole, the transcriptional activity in cells transfected with the variant SNP construct decreased (Figure\u00a0\n\n3h\u2013j\n). We did not observe any change when we repeated the same experiments with exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n3h\u2013j\n).\n      \n      \n        LY75 suppression directs breast cancer epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition\n        To identify molecular mechanisms relevant to the LY75\u2014treatment interaction, we interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\n32\n for genes co\u2010expressed with LY75 in ER+ breast cancer sample set\n33\n using the cBioPortal online platform. After filtering the co\u2010expression gene prediction results, 2,352 predicted genes (Figure\u00a0\n\n4a\n) with Spearman\u2019s correlations \u2265\u00a00.3 or \u2264\u00a0\u22120.3 were selected (Table\u00a0\n\nS6\n). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these 2,352 genes identified PI3K\u2010AKT, MAPK, cell adhesion, and JAK\u2010STAT pathways (Figure\u00a0\n\n4b\n). We evaluated the top pathways, and our results revealed that JAK/STAT signaling was dysregulated by LY75 depletion (Figure\u00a0\n\n4c\n). Activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling via IL\u20106/IL\u20106R leads to increased metastasis resulting from enhanced epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal (EMT).\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n Remarkably, LY75 suppression induced EMT as shown by the expression of specific EMT markers: a significant decrease of E\u2010cadherin and EPCAM; an increase of N\u2010cadherin and SNAIL1 (Figure\u00a0\n\n4c\n). LY75 knockdown cells also displayed decreased proliferation rates compared with the control (Figure\u00a0\n\n2b\n), which was associated with decreased AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (Figure\u00a0\n\n4c\n). Moreover, LY75 suppression significantly promoted cell migration (Figure\u00a0\n\n4d\n). Thus, the in vitro invasiveness and motility of LY75\u2010knockdown cells was inversely correlated with their proliferative potential which might be due to the acquiring of the mesenchymal phenotype.\n38\n To provide potential clues to the observed genetic correlations, we examined the SNP\u2010treatment interaction effect on the JAK/STAT and MAPK activities in LCLs with WT and variant genotypes for the LY75 SNPs. The variant cells showed increased expression of pSTAT3 and decreased pERK in response to androstenedione treatment. In contrast, in WT LCLs, pSTAT3, and pERK, expressions were virtually unchanged with androstenedione. Importantly, the addition of anastrozole, but not exemestane, significantly reduced the pSTAT3 and pERK levels in variant cells (Figure\u00a0\n\n4e\n). The next question that we addressed was the possible mechanism by which the GPR160 SNP might result in differential effects in response to anastrozole and exemestane treatment.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            LY75 suppression directs epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT).

We began our functional genomic studies of the GPR160 SNP starting with the question of whether GPR160 expression might be regulated in an SNP\u2010treatment\u2010dependent fashion. GPR160 mRNA expression was induced by exposure to increasing concentrations of androstenedione in cells with WT genotype, but not in those with the variant SNP genotype (Figure\u00a0\n\n5b\n). We observed a striking reversal of expression with anastrozole, but not exemestane, that is, increased expression in the presence of anastrozole in cells with variant GPR160 SNP genotype, but decreased expression in cells with WT genotype (Figure\u00a0\n\n5b\n). Several EREs were located within 500 bp of the GPR160 SNP (Figure\u00a0\n\n5c\n), and the rs62293499 SNP genotype was associated with striking differential binding to the EREs, with more binding for the WT SNP genotype in the presence of androstenedione, but a greater binding for the variant SNP when anastrozole was present. Exemestane, however, did not change the binding activity (Figure\u00a0\n\n5d\n).\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            \nGPR160 SNP\u2010 and anastrozole\u2010dependent gene regulation.

GPR160 knockdown resulted in the downregulation of cell proliferation pathway, such as PI3K\u2010AKT (Figure\u00a0\n\nS7\n\nb).\nGenetic variation interaction with aromatase inhibitor therapy\n        The Participant Flow Diagram for the MA.27 trial (Figure\u00a0\n\nS1\n) shows the patients included in the SNP\u2010treatment interaction studies. The analysis cohort was restricted to 4,465 White patients (2,226 patients treated with anastrozole and 2,239 patients treated with exemestane, with 121 and 124 breast events in each arm). To determine the possible SNP\u2010treatment interaction effect using the MA.27 cohort, we performed a stratified Cox\u2010proportional hazard analysis utilizing stratification factors and other covariates as detailed in the Methods section. The Manhattan plot (Figure\u00a0\n\n1a\n) shows the results of SNP\u2010treatment interaction analyses for BCFI, and the quantile\u2010quantile plot (Figure\u00a0\n\nS2\n\nA) revealed a lambda of 1.025. Although none of these SNPs met the criteria for genomewide significance, we had used the largest sample set available to perform the GWAS, so we chose to pursue the results functionally and mechanistically. The results of those studies supported the novel insights that are described subsequently regarding genetic mechanisms for variation in AI effect.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            SNP treatment interaction analysis.

Signals with an Exemestane/Anastrozole hazard ratio (HR) of >\u00a01 indicate that patients carrying a variant SNP genotype have reduced efficacy when treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole. On the contrary, signals with an Exemestane/Anastrozole HR of <\u00a01, indicate that patients carrying a variant SNP genotype have a better outcome when treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole. We next investigated these 887 SNPs for their associations with anastrozole (Figure\u00a0\n\n1b\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS2\n\nB) and exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n1c\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS2\n\nC) efficacy (BCFI) separately based on GWAS conducted within each treatment arm in the MA.27 study. One hundred thirty\u2010four of 887 SNPs (Figure\u00a0\n\n1d\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS2\n) were associated with better outcomes (longer BCFI) in exemestane\u2010treated patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.04~0.71, P\u00a0=\u00a02.21E\u201004~0.009), but with shorter BCFI in anastrozole\u2010treated patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.42~3.43, P\u00a0=\u00a06.36E\u201005~0.0097). One hundred twenty\u2010seven of 887 SNPs (Figure\u00a0\n\n1d\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS2\n) were associated with shorter BCFI in exemestane\u2010treated patients (HR=1.41~2.94, P\u00a0=\u00a02.21E\u201004~0.0099), but with longer BCFI in anastrozole\u2010treated patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.01~0.68, P\u00a0=\u00a01.99E\u201005~0.0095). However, these two groups of SNPs (134\u00a0+\u00a0127\u00a0=\u00a0261 SNPs; Figure\u00a0\n\n1e\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS3\n\nA) showed no association with BCFI in the combined analysis of anastrozole and exemestane (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.90~1.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08~0.99) based on our previous published GWAS results for the MA.27 trial.\n14\n\nFigure\u00a0\n\n1e\n plots 3 sets of ordered HRs of 261 SNPs from 3 GWASs; the whole cohort (red), patients who received anastrozole (green), and patients who received exemestane (blue). In the left half of the plot, SNPs whose HRs range from 0 to 1 in exemestane cohort have an HR ranging from 1 to 3 in the anastrozole cohort implying the presence of minor alleles in these SNPs will be protective if treated with exemestane as compared to anastrozole. Similarly, in the right half of the plot, we see a set of SNPs whose HRs suggest being protective alleles for anastrozole and risk alleles for exemestane. HRs obtained from the whole cohort remained constant around one, suggesting low power to detect any SNP effect. In summary, the current analyses revealed a difference in anastrozole and exemestane efficacy in the context of the host genome and identified germline genetic variants that might be able to identify which AI might be superior in preventing breast cancer recurrence in that specific patient. Importantly, over 98.7% of the signals (876 of 887 SNPs) were lost (P\u00a0>\u00a00.01) in the GWAS analysis when anastrozole and exemestane were combined. Moreover, 261 SNPs were observed to be risk alleles for one AI and protective for the other (Figure\u00a0\n\n1e\n).\nGenetic model for guiding aromatase inhibitor selection\n        We next set out to build a genetic model for guiding AI selection. Of the 261 SNPs, 105 SNPs marginally affected BCFI based on any of the clinical covariates and were removed from further analysis. After filtering the 105 SNPs, the remaining 156 SNPs underwent linkage disequilibrium (LD) \u2013clumping analyses.\n22\n In brief, \u201cclumping\u201d reported the SNPs that were within 500\u00a0kb of the significant SNP, were in high LD (r\n2\u00a0>\u00a00.8), and had a low P value. For anastrozole and exemestane cohorts, we chose a P value cutoff <\u00a00. 001, and for the interaction GWAS analysis, we chose a P value cutoff <\u00a09.99E\u201005. From the clumping analysis for each study, we obtained a set of SNPs that were common and unique to each study, as shown in Figure\u00a0\n\n1f\n and Table\u00a0\n\n1\n. Coincidentally, the number of SNPs remaining after clumping was 46 for all 3 studies. As shown in the Venn diagram, we overlapped the SNP IDs from the three studies after clumping to identify a reduced list of SNPs that were significantly associated with anastrozole and with exemestane. Thirty\u2010two SNPs were retained after clumping in all the 3 studies, 14 of those SNPs were present in 2 or more studies (interaction and anastrozole or interaction and exemestane LD analysis), 8 SNPs were unique to exemestane only, and 6 SNPs were retained in the anastrozole only clumping analysis, as shown in Table\u00a0\n\nS3\n. We ultimately obtained a list of 60 unique SNPs (32\u00a0+\u00a014\u00a0+\u00a08\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0=\u00a060) as our SNP panel.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are particularly useful for annotating variants associated with complex traits.\n23\n We, therefore, determined whether any of the 261 SNPs were eQTL SNPs using the Genotype\u2010Tissue Expression (GTEx) website.\n24\n Cis\u2010eQTL analysis identified 46 SNPs that were eQTLs with 2 genes in breast tissue, and an additional 4 genes in other tissues (Table\u00a0\n\nS4\n). Collectively, the eQTL analysis identified six \u201ceGenes\u201d (genes exhibiting association with genotypes for at least one SNP). The SNPs associated with any given gene were in high LD with each other, with pairwise correlation r\n2 = 1.\n        We then investigated which SNP\u2010eGenes were differentially associated with efficacy for anastrozole and exemestane. We took advantage of cell lines selected on the basis of each of the 6 eQTL SNP genotypes from a genomic data\u2010rich panel of 300 human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that has proven to be a powerful tool for testing pharmacogenomic hypotheses.\n15\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n We selected four LCLs with homozygous WT genotypes for each SNP and four LCLs with the variant genotypes with detectable aromatase expression (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n\na) to test the impact of anastrozole and exemestane on cell growth. We ensured that the aromatase activity was inhibited by anastrozole and exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n\nb). The eQTL SNPs for the following genes, LY75, GPR160, PLA2R1, NPLOC4, and NT5C3A, showed that the variant genotypes all had a differential effect on cell growth between exemestane and anastrozole (Figure\u00a0\n\n2a\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n\nc). Among these five eQTL relationships, three were not consistent with our analysis results. The directional effect of the eQTL SNPs for NT5C3A on individual drug efficacy identified through SNP\u2010drug interaction GWAS was not consistent with experimental results (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS1\n). As for the NPLOC4 SNPs, anastrozole, in comparison to exemestane, had greater growth inhibition on cells with variant SNP genotypes, which was consistent with the SNP\u2010drug interaction GWAS results (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)\u00a0=\u00a00.037, HR: Anas vs. Exem\u00a0=\u00a00). However, the anastrozole to exemestane HR was 0 due to the low MAF, resulting in low statistical power,\n30\n, \n31\n raising the possibility that the association might be a false positive. Indeed, regardless of the NPLOC4 SNP genotype, cells grew faster in the presence of exemestane compared with anastrozole (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n). The eQTL SNPs for LY75 (lymphocyte antigen 75), GPR160 (G Protein\u2010Coupled Receptor 160), and PLA2R1 (Phospholipase A2 Receptor 1) showed a consistent effect on drug response between GWAS result and the experimental validation (Figure\u00a0\n\nS4\n, Figure\u00a0\n\n2a\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS1\n), suggesting that these SNPs may differentially affect anastrozole and exemestane response through regulation of the LY75, GPR160, and PLA2R1 genes. We sought to study the functional impact of LY75, GPR160, and PLA2R1 genes, which are expressed in breast tissue (Figure\u00a0\n\nS5\n). Knockdown of LY75 and GPR160, but not PLA2R1, decreased breast cancer cell proliferation (Figure\u00a0\n\n2b,c\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS6\n\na). We then validated the interaction effects of these three genes with AIs. LY75 and GPR160, but not PLA2R1, knockdown cells grew more slowly in the presence of anastrozole compared to exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n2d,e\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS6\n\nb). Therefore, we chose to focus on the functional implications of the LY75 and GPR160 SNPs because those SNPs may represent regulatory variants.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            \nLY75 and GPR160 SNPs dependent effect on cell proliferation.

These 2 SNPs mapped upstream of LY75 on chromosome 2 (Figure\u00a0\n\n3a,b\n) and had significant interaction with treatments (SNP rs1877193: HR: Exe/Ana\u00a0=\u00a00.45; SNP rs6735923: HR: Exe/Ana\u00a0=\u00a00.46; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n), indicating ~\u00a055% reduction in the hazard for a breast cancer event for patients carrying the variant genotype treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole. In treatment\u2010specific cohort GWAS analysis, the two SNPs were associated with opposite effects on risk for a breast event between the two treatment cohorts: increased risk in the anastrozole cohort (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.57, 1.58; P\u00a0=\u00a05.3E\u201004, 6.9E\u201004), and decreased risk in the exemestane cohort (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.70, 0.71; P\u00a0=\u00a06.0E\u201003, 8.0E\u201003). However, the two SNPs showed no association with breast events if the two treatment arms were combined\n14\n (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.07, 1.08; P\u00a0=\u00a00.37, 0.40; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            \nLY75 SNP\u2010 and anastrozole\u2010dependent gene regulation.

The minor allele (MAF\u00a0=\u00a00.338) was associated with decreased risk for breast events when treated with exemestane compared with anastrozole (HR: Exe/Ana\u00a0=\u00a00.43; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n). This effect was also confirmed by independent GWAS analysis in each treatment arm, in that a trend for increased risk of a breast event within the anastrozole arm (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.39, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014), and for significantly decreased risk within the exemestane arm (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.58, P\u00a0=\u00a02.0E\u201004) were observed (Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n). Similar to the LY75 SNPs, rs62293499 was not associated with breast events when the two treatment arms were combined (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.92, P\u00a0=\u00a00.39; Table\u00a0\n\nS5\n).\nLY75 SNP effects differ in the presence of anastrozole vs. exemestane\n        We next set out to determine whether and how the LY75 SNPs might have a differential impact on response to the two AIs through LY75. We selected LCLs with WT and variant genotypes for LY75 SNPs, and then exposed them to an AI in the presence of androstenedione, a precursor of estrogen. The variant cell lines showed a reduction of LY75 expression in response to androstenedione exposure, whereas WT LCLs did not (Figure\u00a0\n\n3c,d\n). Addition of anastrozole showed a striking reversal of the LY75 expression pattern in LCLs with variant SNP genotypes: LY75 expression increased almost threefold with the addition of anastrozole. In contrast, WT expression did not change (Figure\u00a0\n\n3c\n). Of importance, exemestane did not change the expression patterns of LY75 in either WT or variant genotype LCLs (Figure\u00a0\n\n3d\n).\nAnastrozole, but not exemestane, regulates LY75 SNP\u2010dependent ER\u03b1/ERE binding\n        To determine whether the SNP\u2010 and AI\u2010dependent LY75 gene regulation was mediated by ER\u03b1, we first identified two EREs; 2 bp overlap with each other) located ~\u00a0200 bp distant from the LY75 SNP rs1877193 based on ENCODE data (Figure\u00a0\n\n3e\n). We then performed ChIP assays with ER\u03b1 antibody and found that the rs1877193 SNP (Figure\u00a0\n\n3f\n) showed striking differential binding to the ERE that was located closest to the SNP, with greater binding for the variant SNP genotype in the presence of androstenedione, but less binding when additional anastrozole was present. However, this differential binding pattern was not detected after exemestane treatment (Figure\u00a0\n\n3f\n). LY75 expression was reduced whereas ER\u03b1/ERE binding increased in cells with the variant genotypes in response to androstenedione exposure, suggesting that ER\u03b1 functions as a transcription repressor of LY75. Indeed, LY75 expression increased when ESR1 was knocked down (Figure\u00a0\n\n3g\n). These results were compatible with our SNP\u2010treatment interaction analysis results in that variant LY75 SNP genotypes could differentiate anastrozole from exemestane in the risk for a breast event during 5\u00a0years of AI therapy for those enrolled in MA.27.\n        Finally, to determine whether the differences in binding shown in Figure\u00a0\n\n3f\n might have functional consequences; we created reporter gene constructs that included ~\u00a01.1 kb of the LY75 promoter with WT and variant genotypes for the rs1877193 SNP. These reporter gene constructs were then transfected into different cell lines to compare LY75 transcriptional activities for WT and variant SNP genotypes in those cells. within the presence of androstenedione, cells transfected with the variant construct showed higher LY75 transcriptional activity than did cells transfected with the WT construct. However, when the cells were incubated with the addition of 100 nM anastrozole, the transcriptional activity in cells transfected with the variant SNP construct decreased (Figure\u00a0\n\n3h\u2013j\n). We did not observe any change when we repeated the same experiments with exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n3h\u2013j\n).\nLY75 suppression directs breast cancer epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition\n        To identify molecular mechanisms relevant to the LY75\u2014treatment interaction, we interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\n32\n for genes co\u2010expressed with LY75 in ER+ breast cancer sample set\n33\n using the cBioPortal online platform. After filtering the co\u2010expression gene prediction results, 2,352 predicted genes (Figure\u00a0\n\n4a\n) with Spearman\u2019s correlations \u2265\u00a00.3 or \u2264\u00a0\u22120.3 were selected (Table\u00a0\n\nS6\n). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these 2,352 genes identified PI3K\u2010AKT, MAPK, cell adhesion, and JAK\u2010STAT pathways (Figure\u00a0\n\n4b\n). We evaluated the top pathways, and our results revealed that JAK/STAT signaling was dysregulated by LY75 depletion (Figure\u00a0\n\n4c\n). Activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling via IL\u20106/IL\u20106R leads to increased metastasis resulting from enhanced epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal (EMT).\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n Remarkably, LY75 suppression induced EMT as shown by the expression of specific EMT markers: a significant decrease of E\u2010cadherin and EPCAM; an increase of N\u2010cadherin and SNAIL1 (Figure\u00a0\n\n4c\n). LY75 knockdown cells also displayed decreased proliferation rates compared with the control (Figure\u00a0\n\n2b\n), which was associated with decreased AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (Figure\u00a0\n\n4c\n). Moreover, LY75 suppression significantly promoted cell migration (Figure\u00a0\n\n4d\n). Thus, the in vitro invasiveness and motility of LY75\u2010knockdown cells was inversely correlated with their proliferative potential which might be due to the acquiring of the mesenchymal phenotype.\n38\n To provide potential clues to the observed genetic correlations, we examined the SNP\u2010treatment interaction effect on the JAK/STAT and MAPK activities in LCLs with WT and variant genotypes for the LY75 SNPs. The variant cells showed increased expression of pSTAT3 and decreased pERK in response to androstenedione treatment. In contrast, in WT LCLs, pSTAT3, and pERK, expressions were virtually unchanged with androstenedione. Importantly, the addition of anastrozole, but not exemestane, significantly reduced the pSTAT3 and pERK levels in variant cells (Figure\u00a0\n\n4e\n). The next question that we addressed was the possible mechanism by which the GPR160 SNP might result in differential effects in response to anastrozole and exemestane treatment.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            LY75 suppression directs epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT).

We began our functional genomic studies of the GPR160 SNP starting with the question of whether GPR160 expression might be regulated in an SNP\u2010treatment\u2010dependent fashion. GPR160 mRNA expression was induced by exposure to increasing concentrations of androstenedione in cells with WT genotype, but not in those with the variant SNP genotype (Figure\u00a0\n\n5b\n). We observed a striking reversal of expression with anastrozole, but not exemestane, that is, increased expression in the presence of anastrozole in cells with variant GPR160 SNP genotype, but decreased expression in cells with WT genotype (Figure\u00a0\n\n5b\n). Several EREs were located within 500 bp of the GPR160 SNP (Figure\u00a0\n\n5c\n), and the rs62293499 SNP genotype was associated with striking differential binding to the EREs, with more binding for the WT SNP genotype in the presence of androstenedione, but a greater binding for the variant SNP when anastrozole was present. Exemestane, however, did not change the binding activity (Figure\u00a0\n\n5d\n).\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            \nGPR160 SNP\u2010 and anastrozole\u2010dependent gene regulation.

Statistical test: two\u2010way ANOVA. ANOVA, analysis of variance; ERE, estrogen response element; LCL, lymphoblastoid cell line; SNP, single\u2010nucleotide polymorphism.\n          \n          \n        \n        We identified 223 genes that were correlated with GPR160 in TCGA ER+ breast cancer data set (Table\u00a0\n\nS6\n, Figure\u00a0\n\nS7\n\na), enriched in metabolic, PI3K\u2010AKT, and MAPK signaling pathways. GPR160 knockdown resulted in the downregulation of cell proliferation pathway, such as PI3K\u2010AKT (Figure\u00a0\n\nS7\n\nb).\nDISCUSSION\n      In the present investigation, we evaluated the interaction between genetic variation and 2 AIs, exemestane and anastrozole, on BCFI in the MA.27 clinical trial in which postmenopausal women with resected early\u2010stage breast cancer were treated with anastrozole or exemestane adjuvant therapy (Figure\u00a0\n\n1a\n). The SNPs identified in the interaction analysis were analyzed for their association with BCFI in the treatment\u2010specific cohort (Figure\u00a0\n\n1b,c\n), as well as in the combined cohort using our pervious GWAS results.\n14\n This approach allowed the identification of genetic variants that have a differential effect on BCFI between the two AIs (Figure\u00a0\n\n1d\n). The SNPs that interacted with treatments were otherwise lost in the BCFI analysis when the GWAS was adjusted for the treatment arms (Figure\u00a0\n\n1e\n, Table\u00a0\n\nS2\n). Our study has provided additional evidence of potential differences among the third\u2010generation AIs given differences in individual genetic background. We identified an SNP\u2010based model (Table\u00a0\n\nS3\n, Figure\u00a0\n\n1f\n) as a biomarker signature panel for predicting superiority in efficacy between anastrozole and exemestane in a given patient. Our current study only focused on White patients because we only had nine patients from Asian or African decedents who have developed a breast event. In the future, it needs to extend these genetic biomarkers to other ethnicities.\n      Support for the position that anastrozole differs from exemestane is provided by our functional validation studies for the SNPs near the LY75\n\n39\n and GPR160\n\n40\n genes (Figures\u00a03a,b and 5a). Of note, there had been no prior reports of a relationship of either of these genes with AI efficacy or breast cancer risk. The expression of LY75 in cells with variant LY75 SNP sequences was dysregulated by exposure to anastrozole, but not exemestane (Figure\u00a0\n\n3c,d\n), which was compatible with the association of variant LY75 SNP with protection from a breast cancer recurrence while subjects were being treated with exemestane, but not anastrozole. We also showed that the SNP regulated LY75 expression through ER\u03b1 (Figure\u00a0\n\n3e\u2013j\n). We report for the first time a role for the LY75 gene in controlling breast cancer cellular phenotypes and corresponding metastatic potential (Figures\u00a04 and 2b). These findings also raise the possibility of targeting downstream EMT in combination with a specific AI to increase its sensitivity for future testing. The GPR160 SNP mediated GPR160 expression in response to anastrozole, but not exemestane, by regulating ER\u03b1 binding to EREs (Figure\u00a0\n\n5\n). GPR160 played a role in breast cancer cell growth (Figure\u00a0\n\nS7\n\nb, Figure\u00a0\n\n2c\n).\n      Although all three AIs are interchangeable clinically based on large clinical studies, those studies did not consider patient genetic variability for recruitment and stratification. Our study raises the possibility of salvaging specific AI\u2010treated patients identified to be at increased risk of breast cancer recurrence with a given AI in that they could be switched to an alternative AI. Thus, the genetic markers identified in this study could help select the appropriate AI for a given patient. A limitation of our study is that no other large adjuvant trial of monotherapy with anastrozole and exemestane collected genotyping data is available. However, we have obtained evidence that anastrozole and exemestane have differing efficacy depending on genetic background and have identified an SNP biomarker panel that could potentially be used to select optimal AI for a given patient.\nFUNDING\n      This research was supported in part by NIH grants P50CA116201 (Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence), U1961388 (The Pharmacogenomics Research Network), U54 GM114838, BCRF\u201017\u2010075 (the Breast Cancer Research Foundation), U10CA77202, R01CA196648, CCS 015469 from the Canadian Cancer Society, the George M.
