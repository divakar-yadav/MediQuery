    "description": "Background\n          Oncoplastic breast\u2010conserving surgery (O\u2010BCS) involves removing the tumour in the breast and using plastic surgery techniques to reconstruct the breast. The adequacy of published evidence on the safety and efficacy of O\u2010BCS for the treatment of breast cancer compared to other surgical options for breast cancer is still debatable. It is estimated that the local recurrence rate is similar to standard breast\u2010conserving surgery (S\u2010BCS) and also mastectomy, but the aesthetic and patient\u2010reported outcomes may be improved with oncoplastic techniques.\nObjectives\n          Our primary objective was to assess oncological control outcomes following O\u2010BCS compared with other surgical options for women with breast cancer. Our secondary objective was to assess surgical complications, recall rates, need for further surgery to achieve adequate oncological resection, patient satisfaction through patient\u2010reported outcomes, and cosmetic outcomes through objective measures or clinician\u2010reported outcomes.\nSearch methods\n          We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),\u2028MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase (via OVID), the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry\u2028Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 7 August 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions.\nSelection criteria\n          We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non\u2010randomised comparative studies (cohort and case\u2010control studies). Studies evaluated any O\u2010BCS technique, including volume displacement techniques and partial breast volume replacement techniques compared to any other surgical treatment (partial resection or mastectomy) for the treatment of breast cancer.\nData collection and analysis\n          Four review authors performed data extraction and resolved disagreements. We used ROBINS\u2010I to assess the risk of bias by outcome. We performed descriptive data analysis and meta\u2010analysis and evaluated the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. The outcomes included local recurrence, breast cancer\u2010specific disease\u2010free survival, re\u2010excision rates, complications, recall rates, and patient\u2010reported outcome measures.\nMain results\n          We included 78 non\u2010randomised cohort studies evaluating 178,813 women. Overall, we assessed the risk of bias per outcome as being at serious risk of bias due to confounding; where studies adjusted for confounding, we deemed these at moderate risk.\n          \n            Comparison 1: oncoplastic breast\u2010conserving surgery (O\u2010BCS) versus standard\u2010BCS (S\u2010BCS)\n          \n          The evidence in the review found that O\u2010BCS when compared to S\u2010BCS, may make little or no difference to local recurrence; either when measured as local recurrence\u2010free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.34; 4 studies, 7600 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) or local recurrence rate (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.83; 4 studies, 2433 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain due to most studies not controlling for confounding clinicopathological factors. O\u2010BCS compared to S\u2010BCS may make little to no difference to disease\u2010free survival (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26; 7 studies, 5532 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). O\u2010BCS may reduce the rate of re\u2010excisions needed for oncological resection (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85; 38 studies, 13,341 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. O\u2010BCS may increase the number of women who have at least one complication (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.27; 20 studies, 118,005 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and increase the recall to biopsy rate (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.42; 6 studies, 715 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Meta\u2010analysis was not possible when assessing patient\u2010reported outcomes or cosmetic evaluation; in general, O\u2010BCS reported a similar or more favourable result, however, the evidence is very uncertain due to risk of bias in the measurement methods.\n          \n            Comparison 2: oncoplastic breast\u2010conserving surgery (O\u2010BCS) versus mastectomy alone\n          \n          O\u2010BCS may increase local recurrence\u2010free survival compared to mastectomy but the evidence is very uncertain (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91; 2 studies, 4713 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of O\u2010BCS on disease\u2010free survival as there were only data from one study. O\u2010BCS may reduce complications compared to mastectomy, but the evidence is very uncertain due to high risk of bias mainly resulting from confounding (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83; 4 studies, 4839 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Data on patient\u2010reported outcome measures came from single studies; it was not possible to meta\u2010analyse the data.\n          \n            Comparison 3: oncoplastic breast\u2010conserving surgery (O\u2010BCS) versus mastectomy with reconstruction\n          \n          O\u2010BCS may make little or no difference to local recurrence\u2010free survival (HR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.62; 1 study, 3785 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) or disease\u2010free survival (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.22; 1 study, 317 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) when compared to mastectomy with reconstruction, but the evidence is very uncertain. O\u2010BCS may reduce the complication rate compared to mastectomy with reconstruction (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.54; 5 studies, 4973 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain due to high risk of bias from confounding and inconsistency of results. The evidence is very uncertain for patient\u2010reported outcome measures and cosmetic evaluation.\nAuthors' conclusions\n          The evidence is very uncertain regarding oncological outcomes following O\u2010BCS compared to S\u2010BCS, though O\u2010BCS has not been shown to be inferior. O\u2010BCS may result in less need for a second re\u2010excision surgery but may result in more complications and a greater recall rate than S\u2010BCS. It seems that O\u2010BCS may give better patient satisfaction and surgeon rating for the look of the breast, but the evidence for this is of poor quality, and due to lack of numerical data, it was not possible to pool the results of different studies. It seems O\u2010BCS results in fewer complications compared with surgeries involving mastectomy.\n          Based on this review, no certain conclusions can be made to help inform policymakers. The surgical decision for what operation to proceed with should be made jointly between clinician and patient after an appropriate discussion about the risks and benefits of O\u2010BCS personalised to the patient, taking into account clinicopathological factors. This review highlighted the deficiency of well\u2010conducted studies to evaluate efficacy, safety and patient\u2010reported outcomes following O\u2010BCS.",
