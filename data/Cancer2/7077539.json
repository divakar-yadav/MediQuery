    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Breast cancer is one of the most frequent female malignancies and is the second cause of morbidity and mortality in women all over the world.1 In recent years, the incidence of breast cancer is increasing year after year, and the number of breast cancer survivors sustains growth.2 Moreover, 1.67\u00a0million new breast cancer cases and 522\u00a0000 deaths of breast cancer are reported worldwide per year, and the age of onset tends to be younger.3 In China, breast carcinoma is the leading major cause of cancer\u2010related mortality for females and has the highest incidence rate.4 The incidence of breast carcinoma is increasing rapidly in coastal developed cities, and the post\u2010menopausal breast cancer patients in China will reach 100/100\u00a0000 in the future.5 Because of the progress of early diagnosis and the improvement of treatment strategy, lots of patients have been successfully treated, and the average 5\u2010year survival rate is around 90%.6 However, approximately 20%\u201025% patients are diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer, and these patients account for early relapse and deaths.7, 8 A large number of studies have proved that surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy can effectively improve the survival rate of patients according to the progress of early detection and treatment.9, 10, 11\n\n      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is widely used to the treatment for breast cancer and has been testified to be beneficial for breast cancer patients. The application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer has attracted more and more attention as a result of increasing breast\u2010conserving surgery rate in patients who might have required a mastectomy at initial diagnosis and decreasing tumour stage to achieve surgical operation chance and not increasing post\u2010operative recurrence risk.12, 13 The main purpose of NACT is to establish a therapeutic strategy based on proven therapeutic efficacy and reduce the size of tumours and improve breast\u2010conserving rates.14, 15 Although a number of NACT regimens have been used to treat the breast cancer, there is no internationally generally accepted NACT regimen for advanced breast carcinoma.16, 17 Therefore, it is necessary to seek some sensitive and effective indicators of breast carcinoma in order to improve the long\u2010term survival and provide better treatment measures.\n      There are some factors influencing the prognosis of the breast carcinoma, for instance, pathological stage, histologic type, molecular subtypes, tumour size, lymph vessel invasion, menopause age and so forth.18 Some histologic and immunologic indicators are used for assessing the prognosis of breast carcinoma. These indicators depend heavily on primary tumour samples, are often expensive, strenuous and taking a lot of time and are usually limited their use in clinical practice.19 To a greater extent, it is complicated when some variable factors are taken into consideration such as ER status, PR status, Ki\u201067 status, HER2 status of breast carcinoma or post\u2010operative adjuvant treatment. Consequently, it is important to develop clinically easily reliable and accessible biomarkers to stratify the prognosis of patients with breast cancer.\n      In recent years, inflammation has been suggested as a critical and potentially intervenable mechanism in the pathogenesis of patients with carcinoma. Tumour associated inflammation is a fundamental part of the tumour microenvironment and could be responsible for treatment response. The changes in inflammatory cells may affect tumour carcinogenesis, development and metastasis, for example neoplastic cell proliferation, invasion migration and metastasis.20 The detection of peripheral blood can reflect the inflammatory state of tumours for the diagnosis and treatment of tumours. A large number of studies have clarified that the elevated inflammatory biomarkers, for instance, white blood cell (W), neutrophil (N), lymphocyte (L), monocyte (M), platelet counts (P), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), as well as neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010monocyte ratio (LMR) and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), are detected in the systemic circulation and widely considered as prognostic factors for many malignant tumours.21, 22, 23, 24\n\n      An integrated and novel indicator that named systemic immune\u2010inflammation index (SII\u00a0=\u00a0N\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0P/L), which is based on neutrophil (N), platelet (P) and lymphocyte (L) counts, is demonstrated to be related to clinical outcomes and predict the survival time of patients with cancer.25, 26 This integrated indicator may fully reflect the balance between host inflammatory and immune status compared with NLR, LMR/MLR and PLR and other conventional haematological parameters. However, the SII has been studied rarely in breast cancer patients received NACT. As far as we are concerned, the relationship between SII and breast cancer has not been building\u2010up. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the prognostic significance of SII in patients with breast cancer undergoing NACT.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Study population\n        The retrospective analysis was enrolled 262\u00a0patients with advanced breast carcinoma undergoing NACT at Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1999 to December 2014. All patients were confirmed in accordance with the histology by core needle biopsy, and all cases were received NACT treatment. The details of treatment for all patients were extracted from the patients\u2019 medical record. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. It confirmed to the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All enrolled patients received the written informed consent before the study.

One cycle of this regimen was repeated every 3\u00a0weeks.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Classification criteria and response evaluation\n        The tumour size was determined by the maximum diameter of the sample. TNM stage system was performed by the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM stage classification.27, 28 Pathology type was classified as ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and others. Molecular subtypes of breast cancer were divided into Luminal A, Luminal B HER2\u2010positive, Luminal B HER2\u2010negative, HER2\u2010enriched and Triple negative.29 The histologic response was estimated on the basis of Miller and Payne grade (MPG), and the MPG was categorized into five grades in line with the number of tumour cells in excision/ mastectomy specimens compared with the pre\u2010treatment core biopsy as follows 30:(a) grade 1, no reduction in total number of cancer cells; (b) grade 2, minor (<30%) loss of total number of cancer cells; (c) grade 3, estimated 30%\u201090% reduction in total number of cancer cells; (d) grade 4, over (>90%) loss of total number of cancer cells; 5) grade 5, no infiltrating cancer (IC), or ductal carcinoma in situ. Histologic tumour grade was accessed by the Elston\u2010Ellis modification of Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson grading system and based on three factors,31 such as: (a) the amount of gland formation; (b) the nuclear features; and (c) the mitotic activity. Each feature score was 1\u20103 points and then added the score to get the final total score of 3\u20109 points and was categorized into three grades by the following way 32: (a) grade I, the total score of tumours was 3\u20105 points; (b) grade II, the total score of tumours was 6\u20107 points; (c) grade III, the total score of tumours was 8\u20109 points. The response rate was defined in the light of the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) guidelines and was stratified into four groups: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression of disease (PD).33 The sum of CR and PR were the clinical objective response rate, the sum of SD and PD were the non\u2010clinical response rate, and the sum of CR, PR and SD were the clinical benefit rate. Lymph vessel invasion and neural invasion were diagnosed by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain. The toxicity of NACT was accessed on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC).34\n\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Peripheral venous blood parameters\n        Peripheral venous blood samples were taken within 1\u00a0week after breast cancer diagnosis and before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The sterile EDTA tube was used to collect the blood samples. The XE\u20102100 haematology analyser (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) was used to analyse the haematological parameters.\n      \n      \n        2.5\n        Follow\u2010up\n        All enrolled patients had post\u2010operative follow\u2010up in inpatients or outpatients every 3\u00a0months for the 1st to 2nd year, every 6\u00a0months for the 3rd to 5th year after surgery, then annually every year and until death.35 Follow\u2010up assessments included laboratory tests (routine blood test, blood biochemical), physical examination (breast and lymph node palpation), breast ultrasonography, liver ultrasound, mammography and other suitable examinations. Disease\u2010free survival (DFS) referred to the time from the date of operation to the date of local recurrence or distant metastases, death from any reason or final follow\u2010up. Overall survival (OS) referred to the time from the date of operation to the date of death from any reason or final follow\u2010up.\n      \n      \n        2.6\n        Statistical analysis\n        Statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS software (version 17.0) and GraphPad prism software (version 5.0). The optimal cut\u2010off value was accessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses. The clinicopathologic categorical variables were performed as frequencies and percentages (%), and the associations between breast carcinoma and clinicopathological variables were evaluated by chi\u2010squared test or Fisher's exact test. The Kaplan\u2010Meier product limit estimator method was to determine the survival time of DFS and OS, and the association between breast carcinoma and survival was analysed by the Kaplan\u2010Meier plots and log\u2010rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the independent prognostic factors. P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered to be statistical significance.\n2.1\n        Study population\n        The retrospective analysis was enrolled 262\u00a0patients with advanced breast carcinoma undergoing NACT at Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1999 to December 2014.

The XE\u20102100 haematology analyser (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) was used to analyse the haematological parameters.\n2.5\n        Follow\u2010up\n        All enrolled patients had post\u2010operative follow\u2010up in inpatients or outpatients every 3\u00a0months for the 1st to 2nd year, every 6\u00a0months for the 3rd to 5th year after surgery, then annually every year and until death.35 Follow\u2010up assessments included laboratory tests (routine blood test, blood biochemical), physical examination (breast and lymph node palpation), breast ultrasonography, liver ultrasound, mammography and other suitable examinations. Disease\u2010free survival (DFS) referred to the time from the date of operation to the date of local recurrence or distant metastases, death from any reason or final follow\u2010up. Overall survival (OS) referred to the time from the date of operation to the date of death from any reason or final follow\u2010up.\n2.6\n        Statistical analysis\n        Statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS software (version 17.0) and GraphPad prism software (version 5.0). The optimal cut\u2010off value was accessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses. The clinicopathologic categorical variables were performed as frequencies and percentages (%), and the associations between breast carcinoma and clinicopathological variables were evaluated by chi\u2010squared test or Fisher's exact test. The Kaplan\u2010Meier product limit estimator method was to determine the survival time of DFS and OS, and the association between breast carcinoma and survival was analysed by the Kaplan\u2010Meier plots and log\u2010rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the independent prognostic factors. P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered to be statistical significance.\n3\n      RESULTS\n      \n        3.1\n        Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of all breast cancer patients\n        Two hundred and sixty two patients with breast carcinoma were included in this study. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients with breast cancer were shown in Table 1. The ROC analysis was intended for evaluating the optimal cut\u2010off value of the SII (602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L). Hence, the patients were categorized into two groups: low SII group (<602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L) and high SII group (\u2265602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L). All cases were females, and the median age was 48\u00a0years, with the range from 27 to 73\u00a0years. There were 156 patients (59.5%) in low SII group and 106 patients (40.5%) in high SII group. The median body mass index (BMI) was 24.50, and the range was 18.03\u201039.06. All patients with breast cancer received anthracyclines\u2010based and taxanes\u2010based neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens (27 patients received the AC/ACF regimen, 29 patients received the CT/ACT regimen, 121 patients received the AT regimen, 75 patients received TP regimen, and 10 patients received other regimens, such as FP, T, F, TF, EV regimen. All 262 patients underwent surgery, and 221 cases underwent mastectomy, 41 cases underwent breast\u2010conserving surgery. In terms of histologic pathology, 251 patients had ductal carcinoma, 4\u00a0patients had lobular carcinoma, and 7 patients had other pathology (metaplastic carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma of breast). The clinicopathological characteristics were similar between the two groups (Table 1). In our study, patients with low SII value were significantly associated with menopause (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a05.723, P\u00a0=\u00a0.016), US\u2010LNM (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.331,

study were confirmed by core needle biopsy prior to NAC. ER receptor and PR receptor were decided as positive when at least 1% of tumour cells were stained by nuclei. Breast cancer with 0 or 1+ on immunohistochemical staining was considered negative for HER2 and with 3+ on immunohistochemical staining was regarded as HER2 overexpression. However, HER2 with 2+ on immunohistochemical staining was further evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and patient with HER2/CEP17\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.0 was also determined to show HER2 overexpression. Ki\u201067 labelling index \u226414% tumour cells with nuclear staining was considered to be negative, and Ki\u201067 labelling index >14% tumour cells with nuclear staining was considered to be positive. Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 8\u00a0patients were Luminal A subtype, 27\u00a0patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010positive subtype, 98\u00a0patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010negative subtype, 62\u00a0patients were HER2\u2010enriched subtype, and 67 patients were Triple negative subtype, respectively. And 108\u00a0patients were ER negative, 154 patients were ER positive; 129 patients were PR negative, 133\u00a0patients were PR positive; 168 patients were HER2 negative, 94 patients were HER2 positive; 60\u00a0patients were Ki\u201067 negative, 202 patients were Ki\u201067 positive, respectively. After post\u2010operative immunohistochemical pathology, 9 patients were Luminal A subtype, 25\u00a0patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010positive subtype, 94 patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010negative subtype, 66\u00a0patients were HER2\u2010enriched subtype, and 68 patients were Triple negative subtype, respectively. And 122\u00a0patients were ER negative, 140\u00a0patients were ER positive; 131 patients were PR negative, 131\u00a0patients were PR positive; 173\u00a0patients were HER2 negative, 89 patients were HER2 positive; 92\u00a0patients were Ki\u201067 negative, 170\u00a0patients were Ki\u201067 positive, respectively. Moreover, some other indicators were detected, such as AR, CK5/6, E\u2010cad, P53, and TOP2A. And 164 cases were AR negative, 98 cases were AR positive; 228 cases were CK5/6 negative, 34 cases were CK5/6 positive; 109 patients were E\u2010cad negative, 153 patients were E\u2010cad positive; 198 cases were EGFR negative, 64 cases were EGFR positive; 132 cases were P53 negative, 130 cases were P53 positive; 107 cases were TOP2A negative, 155 cases were TOP2A positive, respectively.

Decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers, alopecia and peripheral neurotoxicity were recorded in 92.4% (242/262), 94.7% (248/262), 62.6% (164/262), 9.5% (25/262), 3.8% (10/262), 57.6% (151/262), and 8.8% (23/262), respectively. Moreover, the toxicities by the NCICTC indicated that grade 0 anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression were recorded in 37.4% (98/262), 29.4% (77/262), 27.5% (72/262), 67.9% (178/262), 3.4% (9/262) and 21.0% (55/262); grade 1/2 anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression were recorded in 61.8% (162/262), 40.5% (106/262), 39.7% (104/262), 30.9% (81/262), 95.4% (250/262) and 38.5% (101/262); grade 3/4 anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression were recorded in 0.8% (2/262), 30.1% (79/262), 32.8% (86/262), 1.2% (3/262), 1.2% (3/262) and 40.5% (106/262), respectively. There were no chemotherapy\u2010related deaths occurred in this study. Further studies on the side effects of NACT evaluation in SII proved that there were no differences using the SII in decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers, alopecia, peripheral neurotoxicity (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a00.983, 0.138, 1.281, 0.653, 1.806, 1.682, 0.337; P\u00a0>\u00a0.05), and anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a01.654, 0.694, 1.767, 2.605, 2.285, 0.337; P\u00a0>\u00a0.05), respectively.

Moreover, the DFS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in low SII were 35.9% (56/156), 21.2% (33/156), 5.1% (8/156), and the OS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in low SII were 47.4% (74/156), 33.3% (52/156), 8.3% (13/156), respectively. The DFS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in high SII were 25.5% (27/106), 11.3% (12/106), 3.8% (4/106), and the OS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in high SII were 35.8% (38/106), 20.8% (22/106), 6.6% (7/106), respectively.

Although there was a trend towards significance for the association between low SII and high SII at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year rates, there were no significant differences between the two groups.

We also analysed the SII by MPG. We defined the patients with MPG grade 1 and 2 as MPG\u2010A group, the patients with MPG grade 3 as MPG\u2010B group and patients with MPG grade 4 and 5 as MPG\u2010C group, respectively.

Hence, for the sake of further to study the prognostic efficiency of SII, the SII was analysed by ER status.

The clinicopathological characteristics of patients with breast cancer were shown in Table 1. The ROC analysis was intended for evaluating the optimal cut\u2010off value of the SII (602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L). Hence, the patients were categorized into two groups: low SII group (<602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L) and high SII group (\u2265602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L). All cases were females, and the median age was 48\u00a0years, with the range from 27 to 73\u00a0years. There were 156 patients (59.5%) in low SII group and 106 patients (40.5%) in high SII group. The median body mass index (BMI) was 24.50, and the range was 18.03\u201039.06. All patients with breast cancer received anthracyclines\u2010based and taxanes\u2010based neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens (27 patients received the AC/ACF regimen, 29 patients received the CT/ACT regimen, 121 patients received the AT regimen, 75 patients received TP regimen, and 10 patients received other regimens, such as FP, T, F, TF, EV regimen. All 262 patients underwent surgery, and 221 cases underwent mastectomy, 41 cases underwent breast\u2010conserving surgery. In terms of histologic pathology, 251 patients had ductal carcinoma, 4\u00a0patients had lobular carcinoma, and 7 patients had other pathology (metaplastic carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma of breast). The clinicopathological characteristics were similar between the two groups (Table 1). In our study, patients with low SII value were significantly associated with menopause (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a05.723, P\u00a0=\u00a0.016), US\u2010LNM (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.331,

    In our study, the optimal cut\u2010off value of SII was decided as 602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, which was calculated considering the maximum (sensitivity\u00a0+\u00a0specificity) point of the ROC curve. ROC curve was analysed with OS data of all enrolled patients. The cut\u2010off value of ALT, AST, LDH, IgA, IgG, IgM, ALB, CRP, CA125, CA153, CEA, D\u2010D, FDP, W, red blood cell (R), haemoglobin (Hb), N, M, P and L, NLR, MLR, PLR were determined by its median value, and the cut\u2010off values were 23, 23, 190 U/L, 2.30, 11.67, 1.27, 44.00\u00a0g/L, 1.10\u00a0mg/dL, 27.73\u00a0U/mL, 21.86\u00a0U/mL, 3.52\u00a0ng/ml, 0.83\u00a0mg/L FEU, 2.01\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, and 6.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 4.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 128.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 3.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 1.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 0.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 244.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L, 2.50, 0.22, 160.00, respectively. A low SII was significantly related to ALB (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), CRP (P\u00a0=\u00a0.042), CA125 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.044), W (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), R (P\u00a0=\u00a0.024), Hb (P\u00a0=\u00a0.026), N (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), P (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), NLR (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), MLR (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), PLR (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

pre\u2010operative chemotherapy was six times, and 27\u00a0patients received the AC/ACF regimen, 29\u00a0patients received the CT/ACT regimen, 121\u00a0patients received the AT regimen, 75\u00a0patients received TP regimen, and 10\u00a0patients received other regimens, such as FP, T, F, TF, EV regimen. However, only 116\u00a0patients were received post\u2010operative chemotherapy, and the median number of post\u2010operative chemotherapies was 4 times, and 146 patients were not received post\u2010operative chemotherapy. 18 cases were treated with AC/ACF regimen, 17 cases were treated with CT/ACT regimen, 27 cases were treated with AT regimen, 21 cases were treated with TP regimen, and 33 patients were treated with other regimens, such as C, CTF, CTP, A, AF, AMF, AP, F, FP, T, TF, V, VP regimen. The clinical objective response rate (CR\u00a0+\u00a0PR) was 61.4%, and the clinical benefit rate (CR\u00a0+\u00a0PR+SD) was 97.3%, and non\u2010clinical response rate (SD\u00a0+\u00a0PD) was 38.6%. We also used the MPG system to evaluate the pathological response, and the grade 1 rate was 5.0%, the grade 2 rate was 29.8%, the grade 3 rate was 39.3%, the grade 4 rate was 10.3%, and the grade 5 rate was 15.6%. The pathological response of pCR rate was 20.6%, and the pathological response of non\u2010pCR rate was 79.4%.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n3.4\n        Correlation between SII and breast cancer molecular subtypes\n        All breast cancer patients enrolled in this study were confirmed by core needle biopsy prior to NAC. ER receptor and PR receptor were decided as positive when at least 1% of tumour cells were stained by nuclei. Breast cancer with 0 or 1+ on immunohistochemical staining was considered negative for HER2 and with 3+ on immunohistochemical staining was regarded as HER2 overexpression. However, HER2 with 2+ on immunohistochemical staining was further evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and patient with HER2/CEP17\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.0 was also determined to show HER2 overexpression. Ki\u201067 labelling index \u226414% tumour cells with nuclear staining was considered to be negative, and Ki\u201067 labelling index >14% tumour cells with nuclear staining was considered to be positive. Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 8\u00a0patients were Luminal A subtype, 27\u00a0patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010positive subtype, 98\u00a0patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010negative subtype, 62\u00a0patients were HER2\u2010enriched subtype, and 67 patients were Triple negative subtype, respectively. And 108\u00a0patients were ER negative, 154 patients were ER positive; 129 patients were PR negative, 133\u00a0patients were PR positive; 168 patients were HER2 negative, 94 patients were HER2 positive; 60\u00a0patients were Ki\u201067 negative, 202 patients were Ki\u201067 positive, respectively. After post\u2010operative immunohistochemical pathology, 9 patients were Luminal A subtype, 25\u00a0patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010positive subtype, 94 patients were Luminal B HER2\u2010negative subtype, 66\u00a0patients were HER2\u2010enriched subtype, and 68 patients were Triple negative subtype, respectively. And 122\u00a0patients were ER negative, 140\u00a0patients were ER positive; 131 patients were PR negative, 131\u00a0patients were PR positive; 173\u00a0patients were HER2 negative, 89 patients were HER2 positive; 92\u00a0patients were Ki\u201067 negative, 170\u00a0patients were Ki\u201067 positive, respectively. Moreover, some other indicators were detected, such as AR, CK5/6, E\u2010cad, P53, and TOP2A. And 164 cases were AR negative, 98 cases were AR positive; 228 cases were CK5/6 negative, 34 cases were CK5/6 positive; 109 patients were E\u2010cad negative, 153 patients were E\u2010cad positive; 198 cases were EGFR negative, 64 cases were EGFR positive; 132 cases were P53 negative, 130 cases were P53 positive; 107 cases were TOP2A negative, 155 cases were TOP2A positive, respectively. We also found that 100 patients with breast cancer were diagnosed with lymph vessel invasion, and 65 patients with breast cancer were diagnosed with neural invasion. A low SII was significantly related to core needle biopsy ER status (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a05.662, P\u00a0=\u00a0.017), post\u2010operative pathology IHC HER2 status (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.512, P\u00a0=\u00a0.034).

between SII and side effects of chemotherapy\n        In our study, the side effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for two cycles were evaluated and analysed by NCICTC. We also found that were the haematological and gastrointestinal reaction were the common toxicities after NACT. Decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers, alopecia and peripheral neurotoxicity were recorded in 92.4% (242/262), 94.7% (248/262), 62.6% (164/262), 9.5% (25/262), 3.8% (10/262), 57.6% (151/262), and 8.8% (23/262), respectively. Moreover, the toxicities by the NCICTC indicated that grade 0 anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression were recorded in 37.4% (98/262), 29.4% (77/262), 27.5% (72/262), 67.9% (178/262), 3.4% (9/262) and 21.0% (55/262); grade 1/2 anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression were recorded in 61.8% (162/262), 40.5% (106/262), 39.7% (104/262), 30.9% (81/262), 95.4% (250/262) and 38.5% (101/262); grade 3/4 anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression were recorded in 0.8% (2/262), 30.1% (79/262), 32.8% (86/262), 1.2% (3/262), 1.2% (3/262) and 40.5% (106/262), respectively. There were no chemotherapy\u2010related deaths occurred in this study. Further studies on the side effects of NACT evaluation in SII proved that there were no differences using the SII in decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers, alopecia, peripheral neurotoxicity (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a00.983, 0.138, 1.281, 0.653, 1.806, 1.682, 0.337; P\u00a0>\u00a0.05), and anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and myelosuppression (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a01.654, 0.694, 1.767, 2.605, 2.285, 0.337; P\u00a0>\u00a0.05), respectively.

The independent prognostic factors were performed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models based on time\u2010varying SII analysis. In univariate analysis, age, clinical T stage, clinical TNM stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy times, tumour size, type of surgery, Miller and Payne grade, pathological T stage, pathological TNM stage, positive lymph nodes, core needle biopsy (ER status), post\u2010operative pathology IHC (molecular subtype, ER status, Ki\u201067 status, AR status, CK5/6 status, EGFR status, TOP2A status), lymph vessel invasion, PLR, SII, post\u2010operative chemotherapy, post\u2010operative radiotherapy. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the factors related to DFS and OS to be tumour size, Miller and Payne grade, pathological T stage, pathological TNM stage, core needle biopsy (ER status), post\u2010operative pathology IHC (molecular subtype, ER status, Ki\u201067 status, TOP2A status), lymph vessel invasion, PLR, SII.

Nevertheless, the mean DFS and OS for all enrolled cases with low SII were 40.76\u00a0months (range from 4.00\u2010197.97\u00a0months) and 53.68\u00a0months (range from 5.93\u2010250.97\u00a0months), respectively, and the mean DFS and OS for all patients with high SII were 31.11\u00a0months (range from 6.27\u2010196.40\u00a0months) and 44.47\u00a0months (range from 7.30\u2010238.27\u00a0months), respectively. The mean DFS and OS time in patients with low SII were significantly longer than that in those patients with high SII by using log\u2010rank methods (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.184, P\u00a0=\u00a0.041 and \u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.692, P\u00a0=\u00a0.030, respectively; Figure 1C, 1).\n3.7\n        Survival rate and prognostic significance of SII\n        The DFS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year were 31.7% (83/262), 17.2% (45/262), 4.6% (12/262); the OS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year were 42.7% (112/262), 28.2% (74/262), 7.6% (20/262), respectively. Moreover, the DFS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in low SII were 35.9% (56/156), 21.2% (33/156), 5.1% (8/156), and the OS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in low SII were 47.4% (74/156), 33.3% (52/156), 8.3% (13/156), respectively. The DFS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in high SII were 25.5% (27/106), 11.3% (12/106), 3.8% (4/106), and the OS rates at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year in high SII were 35.8% (38/106), 20.8% (22/106), 6.6% (7/106), respectively. The results also indicated that the incidence of DFS and OS in patients with low SII was higher than that in patients with high SII in 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year rates. Although there was a trend towards significance for the association between low SII and high SII at 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year rates, there were no significant differences between the two groups.

In order to go deep into evaluating the prognostic value of SII, the SII was analysed by the molecular subtypes. And the SII with different molecular subtypes was analysed by the log\u2010rank test (Figure 3). For all enrolled patients with breast carcinoma, the results indicated that the DFS and OS time in patients with low SII were significantly longer than that in those patients with high SII in HER2\u2010enriched subtype (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.448, P\u00a0=\u00a0.035 and \u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a04.371, P\u00a0=\u00a0.037, respectively; Figure 3G, H).

We also analysed the SII by MPG. We defined the patients with MPG grade 1 and 2 as MPG\u2010A group, the patients with MPG grade 3 as MPG\u2010B group and patients with MPG grade 4 and 5 as MPG\u2010C group, respectively. By using the log\u2010rank test, the mean DFS and OS time for patients with low SII were longer than in those with high SII in MPG\u2010A group (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a02.657, P\u00a0=\u00a0.103 and \u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a02.953, P\u00a0=\u00a0.086, respectively; Figure 4A, 4).

Hence, for the sake of further to study the prognostic efficiency of SII, the SII was analysed by ER status. In core needle biopsy, the mean DFS and OS time in patients with low SII by the log\u2010rank test were longer than in those patients with high SII in ER negative (\u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a05.401, P\u00a0=\u00a0.020 and \u03c7\n2\u00a0=\u00a05.476, P\u00a0=\u00a0.019, respectively; Figure 5A, 5).

Some studies have indicated the association between the systemic inflammation and malignant tumours.39, 40, 41, 42 The neutrophils, monocytes, platelets and lymphocytes are associated with the prognosis of different kinds of cancer. Neutrophils are a maker of inflammatory and immune response and influence tumour development, progression and metastasis via restraining inflammatory factors, such as neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinase\u20109 (MMP\u20109), nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010kB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin\u20108 (IL\u20108) have been clarified.43, 44, 45, 46, 47 Monocytes play an important role in tumour angiogenesis, inflammatory response and metastases and can create an environment of chronic oxidative stress, such as oncostain\u2010M, VEGF has been proved.48, 49, 50 Platelets have been found to contribute to an indicator of tumour activity, and relate to growth, invasion and metastasis of the primary tumour; and platelet release promotes cancer cell proliferation mainly through VEGF\u2010integrin cooperative signalling.51, 52, 53 However, lymphocytes are involved in the prevention of tumour proliferation, and the lymphocyte response is an important component of anticancer immunity and immune surveillance, as well as lymphocytes are implicated in the killing of cancer cells and increased chemotherapy responsiveness, and correlates with better survival in cancer patients.54, 55, 56, 57\n\n      Numerous studies showed that inflammatory markers and immune\u2010based prognostic indexes, such as NLR, d\u2010NLR, MLR/LMR and PLR, were considered to have prognostic value for breast cancer.58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 The GEICAM 9906 trial indicated that patients with high NLR were associated with shorter DFS in HER2\u2010enriched subtype (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03), and high NLR was identified as an independent predictor by univariate and multivariate analysis.58 A recent meta\u2010analysis showed that the NLR was related to poor survival time and regarded as a predictive and prognostic factor with 2267 Chinese and Caucasian patients with breast cancer.59 A retrospective study indicated that high LMR value and low NLR value were related to a lower risk of relapse (P\u00a0=\u00a0.048 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.015, respectively) and patients with low NLR would survival longer than those patients with high NLR (P\u00a0=\u00a0.024).60 A study of 239 Japan patients with breast cancer proved that LMR may be a useful prognostic marker in DFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005) and could predict the progression and chemosensitivity in patients with breast cancer treated with pre\u2010operative chemotherapy.61 Another retrospective study proclaimed that LMR was significantly related to a poor prognosis for TNBC subtype of 1570 Chinese breast cancer patients (P\u00a0=\u00a0.041).62\n\n      Meanwhile, a meta\u2010analysis revealed that low LMR was significantly related to poor OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.009) and DFS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) with 5667 individuals, and the LMR might be a predictive factor of poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer.63 In the study by Asano and colleagues, patients with low PLR treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy exhibited higher rates of pCR, DFS, and OS, and PLR was a predictive and prognostic biomarker for patients with triple negative breast cancer.64 The Irish Clinical Oncology Group study (ICORG 16\u201020) also found that high PLR was independently associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer.65 Another study by Cuello\u2010L\u00f3pez J et al indicated that breast cancer patients with low PLR treated with NACT achieved higher complete pathological response and had been proposed as predictive factors of response to NACT.66 Although these inflammatory markers were associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer, the exact results and potential mechanisms were still undefined. The NLR, LMR/MLR and PLR are based on two inflammatory cells and may predict the prognosis of malignant tumours.\n      However, SII based on three inflammatory cells, including neutrophil, platelet and lymphocyte and can fully reflect the balance between host immune and inflammatory status. SII has been investigated in some malignancies, such as gastric cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, and SII has been proved to be an independent predictor of malignant tumours.67, 68, 69, 70 In our study, we confirmed that the SII was the significant prognostic factor by univariate and multivariate analyses and could predict survival in breast cancer patients receiving NACT.\n      In our study, the clinicopathologic and demographic characteristics of the 262 patients with breast cancer were enrolled and analysed. The optimal cut\u2010off value of the SII was 602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L by ROC analysis, and this value was used to the data analysis. The results indicated that the low SII was significantly correlated with menopause and US\u2010LNM. The blood parameters were determined by its median value, and the low SII was significantly correlated with ALB, CRP, CA125, W, R, Hb, N, P, NLR, MLR and PLR. Meanwhile, low SII was significantly related to core needle biopsy ER status, post\u2010operative pathology IHC HER2 status. Moreover, the common toxicities were haematological and gastrointestinal reaction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n      According to univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, tumour size, Miller and Payne grade, pathological T stage, pathological TNM stage, core needle biopsy (ER status), post\u2010operative pathology IHC (molecular subtype, ER status, Ki\u201067 status, TOP2A status), lymph vessel invasion, PLR, and SII were important factors of prognosis. The results determined that SII had prognostic significance by using the cut\u2010off value of 602\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L for DFS and OS time, and patients with low SII had survival longer than those patients with high SII. Meanwhile, the results also indicated that patients with low SII have longer 3\u2010, 5\u2010 and 10\u2010year rates of DFS and OS time. Moreover, we also found that molecular subtypes were the significant prognostic factors, and patients with low SII would have better survival outcome than those with high SII in triple negative subtype.\n      The proliferation activity of tumours is usually determined with immunohistochemical detection of the cell\u2010cycle\u2010specific antigen Ki\u201067. Some studies have proved that Ki\u201067 expression is a useful prognostic factor in breast cancer.71, 72 Our results also indicated that Ki\u201067 status in post\u2010operative pathology IHC was the significant prognostic factor, and patients with low SII would have survive longer than those with high SII by Ki\u201067 status. And further to study the ER status, patients with low SII would survival longer than those patients with high SII by ER negative. The MPG was used to evaluate the histologic response, MPG was the significant prognostic factor, and patients with high MPG grade would survival longer than those with low MPG grade on DFS and OS time. Lymphatic vessel is confided to play a passive role in tumour metastasis, such as the provision of a niche for cancer stem cells and the modulation of antitumour immune responses.73 And tumour angiogenesis and its indicator blood vessel density are closely related to the prognosis in breast cancer.74 In our study, the results indicated that the DFS and OS time in patients with low SII would have survival longer than those patients with high SII by lymph vessel invasion.\n      This study has several limitations. Firstly, this study is a retrospective single\u2010centre study and with the relatively low number of cases. More patients with breast cancer received NACT should be enrolled. Secondly, records on some parameters are not complete and lost to follow\u2010up. Thirdly, with the subgroup analysis, the numbers of patients are less and may influence the outcomes. Fourthly, according to use different cut\u2010off points and end\u2010points, and it is difficult to compare our results of SII with those of other studies. Further prospective and well\u2010designed randomized controlled trials are needed to support our findings, and the SII may be used in combination with other biomarkers to help predict clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer and is adopted in routine practice.\n5\n      CONCLUSIONS\n      SII is the significant prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer and can effectively predict the survival in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT. It is very important to consider the high incidence of breast cancer and the unbalanced distribution of medical condition in China and that reproducible, conveniently and non\u2010invasive biomarkers should be applied to the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. It is very critical and meaningful to understand of haematological parameters and look for new targets for subjective treatment.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors declare no competing financial interests.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n      Li Chen wrote the original draft of the manuscript and reviewed and edited the manuscript; Xiangyi Kong involved in formal analysis; Zhongzhao Wang curated the data; Xiangyu Wang investigated the study; Yi Fang contributed to methodology and supervised the study; Jing Wang provided resources, acquired funding and involved in project administration.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n      The material supporting the conclusion of this article has been included within the article.",
