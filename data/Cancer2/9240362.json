    "description": "Background\n          Breast density has become a topic of international discussion due to its associated risk of breast cancer. As online is often a primary source of women's health information it is therefore essential that breast density information it is understandable, accurate and reflects the best available evidence. This study aimed to systematically assess online international breast density information including recommendations to women.\n2\n      Methods\n      \n        2.1\n        Setting\n        Online publicly accessible websites were searched for breast density information. The websites were accessed and data were extracted between December 2021 and January 2022. Identified webpages included specific breast density information for women (consumers) from English-speaking countries, posted since 2009 (when the first state in the US enacted breast density notification law). Analysis was restricted to text data only (videos and other media were excluded). Webpages were excluded if they were not primarily focused on breast density (e.g. information about breast cancer screening that only briefly touched on breast density) or that focused only on breast density measurement/classification tools and/or the technology of breast screening in relation to breast density. Peer reviewed publications, news articles, social media and any webpage or information explicitly directed to clinicians (e.g. general practitioners (GPs), radiologists, breast physicians, etc.) or scientists were excluded as the focus was on information for women.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Study design\n        Using the Incognito tab in Google (and ensuring that browsing history, cookies and user account information were disabled), the term \u2018breast density\u2019 was searched. The search was conducted 5 times, each time using a different country-specific Google location search workaround to obtain international websites from Australia, Canada, New Zealand (NZ), the United Kingdom (UK) and the US. The top 10 eligible hits for each country-specific search were taken. If any duplication occurred between searches or a webpage was ineligible based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see above and Appendix 1) then the next hit in the Google search was included, limited to the first 5 Google pages (50 hits). All webpage information was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet by one researcher and checked by two other researchers to ensure rigour.\n        Guided by multidisciplinary research team discussion (which included clinical and public health expertise, and consumer representatives) we assessed whether the following relevant information about breast density was described or mentioned: how density is defined/measured, reporting criteria or classification (e.g. BI-RADS), masking bias, independent risk factor, prevalence, age or other associated factors, whether it is mentioned in context of other risk factors for breast cancer, whether the information discusses potential benefits and/or harms of measuring/reporting and notifying about breast density, supplemental screening and recommendations for women. Whether the webpage information also included references/links to peer review data and/or published statements was also captured.\n        A content analysis specifically focusing on breast density recommendations to women (e.g. what women should do/or not do if they have dense breasts) was also conducted. Content analysis combines both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse text data [23]. It allows for the content and frequency of categories to be reported. Content analysis is an appropriate method for scrutinising text data.\n        Additionally, the readability, understandability and actionability of webpage information was assessed. Readability was measured using the SHeLL Editor [24] (which calculates grade reading scoring using SMOG [25]). A lower grade reading score means that the text is easier to read and aiming for a \u2018Grade 8\u2019 readability score is advised for most audiences [26,27]. To complement readability, the widely established Patient Education Assessment Tool (PEMAT) [28] was used to measure understandability and actionability of the information. The PEMAT is a 24-item measure which assesses understandability including content, word choice and style, use of numbers, organisation, layout and design and visual aids, and actionability including the actions or steps the consumer can take to follow recommendations or advice.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Analysis\n        For the content analysis of recommendations to women, three researchers independently reviewed a sub-set of websites, across each country-specific search, to develop a list of recurring themes and codes. A code is a predefined category which conveys a key component of the information. These themes and codes were then discussed amongst the three researchers, and this informed an initial coding framework. All information was then independently coded into the framework by the two researchers. Further revisions to the framework were discussed and made as required during the coding. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated for intercoder reliability and indicated a strong level of agreement (k\u00a0=\u00a00.90). Any inconsistencies in coding were discussed and resolved amongst the 3 researchers. Descriptive statistical analysis in SPSS v.28 [29] was used to assess the frequency of each code and a text example is provided in the results supporting the themes.\n        For readability, complete text data was copied and pasted into the SHeLL Editor [24] by one researcher and a readability score (grade reading score) was computed. A sub-set of websites was also independently checked by two researchers for accuracy and consistency. Microsoft\u00ae Excel version 16.58 was used for descriptive statistical analysis.\n        The PEMAT assessment (for understandability and actionability) was conducted independently by two researchers who scored each item (n\u00a0=\u00a024; 1-Agree, 0\u00a0=\u00a0Disagree or NA=Not Applicable), with any discrepancies resolved by discussion or a third researcher. The total score is a proportion of all \u2018Agree\u2019 responses, presented on a scale from 1 to 100%, with 70% considered adequate [30]. Agreement was assessed again using Cohen's kappa coefficient and Microsoft\u00ae Excel version 16.58 was used for descriptive statistical analysis.\n3\n      Results\n      Information from a total of 42 websites (range: 1\u20135 webpages each website) across all searches were eligible and were included in the systematic assessment. Websites were from the US (n\u00a0=\u00a026), Canada (n\u00a0=\u00a08), Australia (n\u00a0=\u00a04), New Zealand (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and the UK (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Type of websites included medical facilities (n\u00a0=\u00a013), non-profit consumer organisations (n\u00a0=\u00a011), screening services (n\u00a0=\u00a06), government (n\u00a0=\u00a05), professional organisations/societies (n\u00a0=\u00a03), health-based websites (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and medical technology company (n\u00a0=\u00a01).

All of the websites (n\u00a0=\u00a042) included information on how breast density is defined and measured. Most websites also discussed the issue of masking bias (n\u00a0=\u00a040), increased risk of breast cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a038) and the option of supplemental screening (n\u00a0=\u00a037). The prevalence of breast density in women and that breast density can change over time were both discussed in 30 of the 42 websites. Just over half (n\u00a0=\u00a026) of the websites listed factors associated with breast density, while other risk factors for breast cancer (beyond breast density) were included in 12 webpages. The variability of radiologist reporting classification was only discussed in 4 of the included webpages.\n        Information on benefits and harms focused on supplemental screening, with 24 webpages including information on the benefits (e.g. that supplemental screening can find more cancers), and 19 describing the harms (e.g. false-positives or additional biopsies). 7 websites directly stated a benefit of measuring/knowing breast density beyond risk factor information (e.g. \u201cinformation is powerful\u201d) and 5 of the same and other websites directly stated a harm of measuring/knowing (e.g. \u201cmay create undue anxiety about risk and women may worry that their mammogram has missed a breast cancer\u201d).\n        In terms of additional information and links, 14 of the 42 websites included references or links to peer-reviewed data, 7 included references or links to published statements or other breast density information (e.g. from other webpages), and 5 included additional audio/visual information (4 videos and 1 podcast). 8 of the 42 websites directly mentioned peer-reviewed data, however, did not provide any direct references. Also, estimates (e.g. risk, prevalence) varied across the different websites.\n        There were no consistent patterns in the included information across website country or type of website. However, on the US websites there was often also information about notification laws (e.g. explaining the laws to women, when they were implemented and what the laws mean for women). The CDC website provided the most detailed information and additional resources (based on our data extraction categories).\n        Across the information, the use of emotive and persuasive language was also identified in a few (n\u00a0=\u00a04) of the included websites e.g. \u201cbreast density is medical professionals best kept secret.\u201d\n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Readability, understandability and actionability\n        Table 2 outlines the individual websites\u2019 readability, understandability and actionability scores. The average grade reading level across all websites was 12.4, ranging from Healthwise (8.9) having the lowest readability score and most readable information, to the BreastScreen Australia position statement (15.4) having the highest readability score and most difficult to read information. Only one website reached the recommended grade 8 reading level. The mean understandability was 69.9% and the mean actionability was 40.1% (see Appendix 2 for complete scoring by PEMAT item). For understandability, 18 of the 42 websites scored lower than 70% (considered adequate). For actionability, 39 of the 42 websites scored lower than 70% (considered adequate), with most webpages (16 out of 42) scoring 40% and a few websites (6 out of 42) scoring 0%.Table 2Readability, understandability, and actionability of international breast density websites (n\u00a0=\u00a042).Table 2WebsiteCountryType of websiteReadability Score (grade level)aUnderstandability Score (%)bActionability Score (%)bBreastScreen AustraliaAustraliaScreening service15.438.50.0BreastScreen VictoriaAustraliaScreening service12.175.040.0BreastScreen Western AustraliaAustraliaScreening service12.175.060.0Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA)AustraliaNon-profit consumer organisation13.768.860.0Alberta HealthCanadaGovernment9.377.040.0BreastScreen New BrunswickCanadaScreening service13.273.320.0British Columbia Cancer ScreeningCanadaScreening service10.675.060.0Canadian Cancer SocietyCanadaNon-profit consumer organisation9.577.060.0Canada Care OntarioCanadaGovernment12.986.740.0Cancer Care ManitobaCanadaGovernment10.181.380.0Dense Breasts CanadaCanadaNon-profit consumer organisation12.781.380.0MammAlive FoundationCanadaNon-profit consumer organisation11.956.360.0BreastScreen AotearoaNew ZealandScreening service14.986.720.0Breast Cancer Foundation New ZealandNew ZealandNon-profit consumer organisation13.150.040.0VolparaNew ZealandMedical technology company11.475.020.0Prevent Breast CancerUKNon-profit consumer organisation12.875.00.0America College of Radiology (ACR)USProfessional Organisation/society11.075.060.0Are You DenseUSNon-profit consumer organisation13.570.683.3Barnabas Health Ambulatory Care CentreUSMedical Facility14.046.240.0Breast Cancer 360.orgUSNon-profit consumer organisation12.356.30.0Breast Cancer.orgUSNon-profit consumer organisation13.262.560.0Brigham Health HubUSMedical Facility14.962.520.0Cancer.org (American Cancer Society)USProfessional organisation/society11.180.040.0Carolina Breast Imaging SpecialistsUSMedical Facility12.576.90.0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)USGovernment9.281.340.0Charlotte RadiologyUSMedical Facility14.275.020.0Dennis R.

This included suggestions about discussing what breast density means for them, their individual risk and supplemental screening. The second most common recommendation identified in 24 websites (57.1%) was for women to consider the benefits of supplemental screening. Sub-themes under this recommendation included that supplemental screening finds more cancers (n\u00a0=\u00a016, 38.1%) and the overall downsides/limitations of mammography alone (n\u00a0=\u00a08, 19%). The third most common recommendation was for women to continue to have regular mammography/discussing the importance of having regular mammography (n\u00a0=\u00a023, 54.8%). Other common themes in the recommendation to women were highlighting potential harms/uncertainty around supplemental screening (n\u00a0=\u00a016, 38.1%) including the sub-theme on the limited evidence (n\u00a0=\u00a014, 33.3%), and benefits of tomosynthesis (n\u00a0=\u00a015, 35.7%), while lifestyle changes related to breast cancer risk were only recommended by a few websites (n\u00a0=\u00a04, 9.5%).\nConclusions\n          Online information about breast density varies widely and is not generally presented in a way that women can easily understand and act on, therefore greatly reducing the ability for informed decision-making. International organisations and groups disseminating breast density information need to ensure that women are presented with health literacy-sensitive and balanced information, and be aware of the impact that recommendations may have on practice.\n1\n      Introduction\n      Breast density is one of several independent risk factors for breast cancer [1]. Estimates suggest that approximately 40%\u201350% of women in the breast screening population in the United States [2] and at least 23% in Australia [3] have dense breasts. Apart from this, having dense breasts also increases a woman's risk of having an interval breast cancer (i.e. cancer not detected at screening) [4] due to lower sensitivity of mammography in women with dense breast tissue [5].\n      Breast density (generally accepted as BI-RADS density C or D, as measured on mammography [6]) is a relatively non-modifiable risk factor [7]. It is therefore unclear what women with dense breasts can or should do to manage their risk of breast cancer. Supplemental screening using ultrasound or MRI has been recommended to mitigate the risk of a missed cancer on mammography in women with dense breasts, however there is no consensus on the benefit that these additional screening modalities have on breast cancer mortality [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. They also lead to an increase in false-positive results and unnecessary biopsy [12,13], and may contribute to breast cancer overdiagnosis.\n      Breast density notification was enacted in the United States (US) about a decade ago, and since that time, the complex concept of breast density has become more widespread among consumers and health care providers [14]. In 2015 in the US, it was shown that health information materials designed to communicate information about breast density during the notification process scored poorly on readability and understandability, and were written beyond average reading and health literacy levels of the population [15]. Other studies that have looked at readability of online patient education materials for breast density in the US have demonstrated similar findings [[16], [17], [18]]. Furthermore, studies have also consistently shown that breast density understanding and knowledge amongst women in the US continues to be low and variable [19]. Now, other countries around the world are beginning to notify or consider notifying women about their breast density, with many English-speaking countries with population-based screening programs having discussions and debates about how best to communicate and/or notify women about their breast density.\n      As online information is often now the primary source of information for women's health understanding and decision-making [[20], [21], [22]], it is essential that the information provided to women is understandable, accurate and reflects the best available evidence. To our knowledge there is no published data which assesses online information about breast density beyond readability in the US, or has analysed what this online information is recommending to women. This study therefore aims to systematically assess breast density information found on online international websites, and assess the recommendations to women about what to do with this information. Specifically, it aims to assess content (included information), to analyse the recommendations to women and to evaluate readability and understandability of the included information on breast density.\n2.1\n        Setting\n        Online publicly accessible websites were searched for breast density information. The websites were accessed and data were extracted between December 2021 and January 2022. Identified webpages included specific breast density information for women (consumers) from English-speaking countries, posted since 2009 (when the first state in the US enacted breast density notification law). Analysis was restricted to text data only (videos and other media were excluded). Webpages were excluded if they were not primarily focused on breast density (e.g. information about breast cancer screening that only briefly touched on breast density) or that focused only on breast density measurement/classification tools and/or the technology of breast screening in relation to breast density. Peer reviewed publications, news articles, social media and any webpage or information explicitly directed to clinicians (e.g. general practitioners (GPs), radiologists, breast physicians, etc.) or scientists were excluded as the focus was on information for women.\n2.2\n        Study design\n        Using the Incognito tab in Google (and ensuring that browsing history, cookies and user account information were disabled), the term \u2018breast density\u2019 was searched. The search was conducted 5 times, each time using a different country-specific Google location search workaround to obtain international websites from Australia, Canada, New Zealand (NZ), the United Kingdom (UK) and the US. The top 10 eligible hits for each country-specific search were taken. If any duplication occurred between searches or a webpage was ineligible based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see above and Appendix 1) then the next hit in the Google search was included, limited to the first 5 Google pages (50 hits). All webpage information was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet by one researcher and checked by two other researchers to ensure rigour.\n        Guided by multidisciplinary research team discussion (which included clinical and public health expertise, and consumer representatives) we assessed whether the following relevant information about breast density was described or mentioned: how density is defined/measured, reporting criteria or classification (e.g. BI-RADS), masking bias, independent risk factor, prevalence, age or other associated factors, whether it is mentioned in context of other risk factors for breast cancer, whether the information discusses potential benefits and/or harms of measuring/reporting and notifying about breast density, supplemental screening and recommendations for women. Whether the webpage information also included references/links to peer review data and/or published statements was also captured.\n        A content analysis specifically focusing on breast density recommendations to women (e.g. what women should do/or not do if they have dense breasts) was also conducted. Content analysis combines both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse text data [23]. It allows for the content and frequency of categories to be reported. Content analysis is an appropriate method for scrutinising text data.\n        Additionally, the readability, understandability and actionability of webpage information was assessed. Readability was measured using the SHeLL Editor [24] (which calculates grade reading scoring using SMOG [25]). A lower grade reading score means that the text is easier to read and aiming for a \u2018Grade 8\u2019 readability score is advised for most audiences [26,27]. To complement readability, the widely established Patient Education Assessment Tool (PEMAT) [28] was used to measure understandability and actionability of the information. The PEMAT is a 24-item measure which assesses understandability including content, word choice and style, use of numbers, organisation, layout and design and visual aids, and actionability including the actions or steps the consumer can take to follow recommendations or advice.\n2.3\n        Analysis\n        For the content analysis of recommendations to women, three researchers independently reviewed a sub-set of websites, across each country-specific search, to develop a list of recurring themes and codes. A code is a predefined category which conveys a key component of the information. These themes and codes were then discussed amongst the three researchers, and this informed an initial coding framework. All information was then independently coded into the framework by the two researchers. Further revisions to the framework were discussed and made as required during the coding. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated for intercoder reliability and indicated a strong level of agreement (k\u00a0=\u00a00.90). Any inconsistencies in coding were discussed and resolved amongst the 3 researchers. Descriptive statistical analysis in SPSS v.28 [29] was used to assess the frequency of each code and a text example is provided in the results supporting the themes.\n        For readability, complete text data was copied and pasted into the SHeLL Editor [24] by one researcher and a readability score (grade reading score) was computed. A sub-set of websites was also independently checked by two researchers for accuracy and consistency. Microsoft\u00ae Excel version 16.58 was used for descriptive statistical analysis.\n        The PEMAT assessment (for understandability and actionability) was conducted independently by two researchers who scored each item (n\u00a0=\u00a024; 1-Agree, 0\u00a0=\u00a0Disagree or NA=Not Applicable), with any discrepancies resolved by discussion or a third researcher. The total score is a proportion of all \u2018Agree\u2019 responses, presented on a scale from 1 to 100%, with 70% considered adequate [30]. Agreement was assessed again using Cohen's kappa coefficient and Microsoft\u00ae Excel version 16.58 was used for descriptive statistical analysis.\n3.1\n        Categorised breast density information\n        The information on the websites varied widely. All of the websites (n\u00a0=\u00a042) included information on how breast density is defined and measured. Most websites also discussed the issue of masking bias (n\u00a0=\u00a040), increased risk of breast cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a038) and the option of supplemental screening (n\u00a0=\u00a037). The prevalence of breast density in women and that breast density can change over time were both discussed in 30 of the 42 websites. Just over half (n\u00a0=\u00a026) of the websites listed factors associated with breast density, while other risk factors for breast cancer (beyond breast density) were included in 12 webpages. The variability of radiologist reporting classification was only discussed in 4 of the included webpages.\n        Information on benefits and harms focused on supplemental screening, with 24 webpages including information on the benefits (e.g. that supplemental screening can find more cancers), and 19 describing the harms (e.g. false-positives or additional biopsies). 7 websites directly stated a benefit of measuring/knowing breast density beyond risk factor information (e.g. \u201cinformation is powerful\u201d) and 5 of the same and other websites directly stated a harm of measuring/knowing (e.g. \u201cmay create undue anxiety about risk and women may worry that their mammogram has missed a breast cancer\u201d).\n        In terms of additional information and links, 14 of the 42 websites included references or links to peer-reviewed data, 7 included references or links to published statements or other breast density information (e.g. from other webpages), and 5 included additional audio/visual information (4 videos and 1 podcast). 8 of the 42 websites directly mentioned peer-reviewed data, however, did not provide any direct references. Also, estimates (e.g. risk, prevalence) varied across the different websites.\n        There were no consistent patterns in the included information across website country or type of website. However, on the US websites there was often also information about notification laws (e.g. explaining the laws to women, when they were implemented and what the laws mean for women). The CDC website provided the most detailed information and additional resources (based on our data extraction categories).\n        Across the information, the use of emotive and persuasive language was also identified in a few (n\u00a0=\u00a04) of the included websites e.g. \u201cbreast density is medical professionals best kept secret.\u201d\n3.2\n        Readability, understandability and actionability\n        Table 2 outlines the individual websites\u2019 readability, understandability and actionability scores. The average grade reading level across all websites was 12.4, ranging from Healthwise (8.9) having the lowest readability score and most readable information, to the BreastScreen Australia position statement (15.4) having the highest readability score and most difficult to read information. Only one website reached the recommended grade 8 reading level. The mean understandability was 69.9% and the mean actionability was 40.1% (see Appendix 2 for complete scoring by PEMAT item). For understandability, 18 of the 42 websites scored lower than 70% (considered adequate). For actionability, 39 of the 42 websites scored lower than 70% (considered adequate), with most webpages (16 out of 42) scoring 40% and a few websites (6 out of 42) scoring 0%.Table 2Readability, understandability, and actionability of international breast density websites (n\u00a0=\u00a042).Table 2WebsiteCountryType of websiteReadability Score (grade level)aUnderstandability Score (%)bActionability Score (%)bBreastScreen AustraliaAustraliaScreening service15.438.50.0BreastScreen VictoriaAustraliaScreening service12.175.040.0BreastScreen Western AustraliaAustraliaScreening service12.175.060.0Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA)AustraliaNon-profit consumer organisation13.768.860.0Alberta HealthCanadaGovernment9.377.040.0BreastScreen New BrunswickCanadaScreening service13.273.320.0British Columbia Cancer ScreeningCanadaScreening service10.675.060.0Canadian Cancer SocietyCanadaNon-profit consumer organisation9.577.060.0Canada Care OntarioCanadaGovernment12.986.740.0Cancer Care ManitobaCanadaGovernment10.181.380.0Dense Breasts CanadaCanadaNon-profit consumer organisation12.781.380.0MammAlive FoundationCanadaNon-profit consumer organisation11.956.360.0BreastScreen AotearoaNew ZealandScreening service14.986.720.0Breast Cancer Foundation New ZealandNew ZealandNon-profit consumer organisation13.150.040.0VolparaNew ZealandMedical technology company11.475.020.0Prevent Breast CancerUKNon-profit consumer organisation12.875.00.0America College of Radiology (ACR)USProfessional Organisation/society11.075.060.0Are You DenseUSNon-profit consumer organisation13.570.683.3Barnabas Health Ambulatory Care CentreUSMedical Facility14.046.240.0Breast Cancer 360.orgUSNon-profit consumer organisation12.356.30.0Breast Cancer.orgUSNon-profit consumer organisation13.262.560.0Brigham Health HubUSMedical Facility14.962.520.0Cancer.org (American Cancer Society)USProfessional organisation/society11.180.040.0Carolina Breast Imaging SpecialistsUSMedical Facility12.576.90.0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)USGovernment9.281.340.0Charlotte RadiologyUSMedical Facility14.275.020.0Dennis R.

Of the 42 websites, 36 (85.7%) had some breast density-related recommendation to women, while 6 websites (14.3%) provided no recommendations for breast density.

Sub-themes under this recommendation included that supplemental screening finds more cancers (n\u00a0=\u00a016, 38.1%) and the overall downsides/limitations of mammography alone (n\u00a0=\u00a08, 19%).

Similar to recent findings on breast cancer risk assessment information online and previous findings on readability and understandability of various sources of breast density information, readability was overall high meaning that it was well above the international recommended grade 6\u20138 reading level [26,27,31,32], and understandability was poor amongst a large sample of the websites [[15], [16], [17], [18],32]. However, all earlier breast density studies only assessed US-based information and did not comprehensively assess (e.g. just readability only) the included content. Therefore, our systematic assessment adds to these from an international perspective and importantly assessed whether the information discussed benefits and harms, the actionability of the information, and the recommendations to women. Attention to how breast density information is crafted and communicated to women is important given the evolving broader context of breast risk assessment (including artificial intelligence approaches), which means that information on density as well as other breast cancer risk factors is relevant to screening programs and breast imaging services [33,34].\n      There were no consistent patterns for the included information across the websites by country or type. Surprisingly the US websites did not score noticeably better than other countries in readability, understandability and actionability, even though breast density information has been more widely discussed, disseminated, and evaluated there, and notification legislation was recently nationally mandated [35]. While the vast majority of the information was focused on breast density itself \u2013 i.e. what it is, how it is measured and what it means for women \u2013 there were only a few websites that directly stated the benefits and harms of measuring and knowing breast density. Most of the focus of benefits and harms were around supplemental screening, however, given the limited evidence of benefit, it is important for information to also mention whether breast density should even be measured and/or notified to women in the first place and the evidence (or lack of evidence) to support this [36]. Interestingly a recent focus group study of Australian women who had little to no previous awareness or knowledge of breast density found that information on harms including overdiagnosis did not seem to have a strong swaying effect on women's views about breast density, although the expressed desire for more information, e.g. \u201cbe alert not alarmed\u201d, was very strong [37]. Furthermore, most websites had no mention or links to peer-reviewed data and/or references, while a few had direct references to studies in the text but no actual references provided. This demonstrates that direct claims and recommendations are being made about breast density but not always supported by evidence, which could be incorrectly adding credibility to the information or their arguments. Also, there seemed to be quite a bit of variability in the estimates or data provided which is understandable given the variability in the current evidence surrounding breast density but may add to confusion for women [36].\n      In terms of recommendations, most of the websites recommend that women talk to their doctor about breast density and what it means for them. Of relevance, studies now demonstrate important gaps in primary care practitioners\u2019 understanding of breast density and confidence in having discussions with women about the implications of dense breasts [38,39]. If women are being directed to their doctors, particularly primary care practitioners, as the first port of call for discussion, they will need further and continued training and support. There also needs to be more balanced recommendations in terms of supplemental screening, as this review demonstrated that the benefits are more often discussed than the harms. Notably lifestyle changes related to risk (e.g. weight loss, reduce alcohol intake) were mentioned least in the recommendations to women, even though there is now good evidence that modifiable risk factors for breast cancer carry similar risks to relatively non-modifiable risk factors such as breast density [40,41].\n      To our knowledge this is the first study to assess breast density information from international websites, and analyse direct-to-consumer breast density recommendations. Due to the current low and varied awareness and knowledge surrounding breast density in the community from both the US and countries without widespread notification or legislation [19,37], and varying advice and stances from medical professionals and bodies globally [8,11,42], it is critical to know what women are being told in relation to this controversial topic online. The analysis was conducted systematically, and used well-developed and established tools and measures, including the content analysis method [23]. However, this study also has several limitations. Firstly, we only searched online information in Google. However, the internet is now a primary source where women get their health information [[20], [21], [22]] and the majority of users use Google for their online search [43,44]. Also, the analysis only included the top 10 hits from English-speaking countries with the majority of webpages being from the US. Other webpages beyond the first 10 hits and from other countries information may further vary. As only text content was included, audio and/or visual information may have had more accurate, balanced or health literacy-sensitive information, however from our search only 4 of the webpages included videos and 1 included a podcast. It is important to note that actionability may be low because the purpose of some of the material was just to educate and/or inform women and therefore may have reduced the overall score in this category. Lastly, we did not directly assess whether the websites discussed new directions in automation and AI driven tools for better selecting higher risk women for screening, including those with breast density. Further research into this area is still needed.\n      In conclusion, we found that online information about breast density varies widely, and is not generally presented in a way that women can easily understand and act on, therefore greatly reducing the ability for informed decision-making. As other countries outside the US begin or consider notifying women about their breast density on a more widescale level, it is likely that more women will turn to online sources for information. International organisations and groups disseminating breast density information directly to women need to ensure that all potential readers are presented with readable, understandable balanced information and be aware of the impact that recommendations may have on primary care practitioners.\nAuthor contribution statement\n      BN, TC and HD conceived the study.
