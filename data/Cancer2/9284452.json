    "description": "Background\n          The association between breast cancer patients with a TP53 pathogenic variant and risk of local recurrence and contralateral breast cancer remains largely unknown.\nMethods\n          The study population of 11093 patients was derived from two cohorts at the Breast Center of Peking University Cancer Hospital in China from November 2003, to March 2018. TP53 germline variants were determined for all patients.\n3\n      Results\n      \n        3.1\n        Clinicopathological characteristics between TP53 carriers and non-carriers in the entire cohort\n        In this cohort of 11093 breast cancer patients, 41 patients (0.37%) carried a TP53 pathogenic variant, while 11052 patients (99.63%) were non-carriers. The rates of TP53 variant were 0.34% in the first cohort and 0.38% in the second cohort, respectively. The age at diagnosis of breast cancer in TP53 carriers were significantly younger than that in non-carriers (mean age at diagnosis, 39.9 vs 50.4, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and TP53 carriers were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and HER2-positive tumors than non-carriers (Table 1). There were no differences in other characteristics between TP53 carriers and non-carriers. This cohort of patients were mainly derived from a series of unselected breast cancer patients (see above methods section). Of these 41 TP53 carriers, only 4 patients met the criteria for LFS or LFL syndrome, and 12 patients met the Chompret revised criteria [31] (Table 2). In addition, three out of 41 TP53 carriers had a personal history of other malignancies, including one developed gastric cancer 3 years after breast cancer diagnosis; one developed thyroid cancer and lung cancer (3 years before breast cancer diagnosis and 1 year after breast cancer diagnosis, respectively); and another one developed sarcoma in the chest wall 12 years after radiotherapy. Detailed information on the clinicopathological characteristics of all 41 TP53 carriers is presented in Table 2. In this study, we found a subset of TP53 carriers with a variant allele frequency (VAF) less than 35% (Table 2). In order to exclude the possibility of mosaicism or clonal hematopoiesis, 13 of 28 TP53 carriers initially detected by 62-gene panel (including 8 patients with initial VAF <35%) were further validated by a 560 cancer-related gene panel or whole exome sequencing (WES) in blood and/or tumor samples from these cases, and an independent Sanger sequencing was performed for all the 28 patients who were detected by the initial 62-gene (Supplementary Table S1). We found that the TP53 variants were presented in the tumor tissues from these TP53 carriers, thus clonal hematopoiesis could be excluded (Supplementary Table S1). However, a few cases (3 cases) still exhibited a VAF <35% but >20% after these validations, we could not exclude the possibility of mosaic mutation for these cases (Supplementary Table S1).Table 1Clinicopathologic characteristics of TP53 carriers and non-carriers in the entire cohort.Table 1CharacteristicsNo.TP53 carriersNon-carriersP valueN(%)N(%)Total1109341(0.37)11052(99.63)Follow-up(years)Median (range)6.7 (0.3\u201318.0)6.8 (1.7\u201316.4)6.7 (0.3\u201318.0)Age at diagnosis(years)Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD50.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.639.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.950.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6<0.001Median (range)49(16\u201398)40(20\u201371)50(16\u201398)\u22643033612(29.3)324(2.9)<0.00131\u20134019709(22.0)1961(17.7)41\u201350358914(34.1)3575(32.3)>5051986(14.6)5192(47.0)Tumor size\u22642\u00a0cm470017(44.7)4683(43.5)0.88>2\u00a0cm610221(55.3)6081(56.5)Unknown2913288Tumor histologyDCIS8907(17.1)883(8.0)0.09IDC895829(70.7)8929(80.8)Other12455(12.2)1240(11.2)Tumor gradea\u21609461(4.0)945(10.6)0.41\u2161648221(84.0)6461(72.8)\u216214733(12.0)1470(16.6)Unknown130291293Lymph node statusNegative685823(59.0)6835(63.4)0.57Positive396916(41.0)3953(36.6)Unknown2662264ER statusNegative296116(41.0)2945(27.1)0.050Positive795723(59.0)7934(72.9)Unknown1752173PR statusNegative355214(35.9)3538(32.6)0.66Positive735425(64.1)7329(67.4)Unknown1872185HER2 statusNegative792222(57.9)7900(74.8)0.017Positive268116(42.1)2665(25.2)Unknown4903487SurgeryBCT419219(46.3)4173(37.8)0.26M690122(53.7)6879(62.2)Adjuvant therapyChemotherapy248812(29.3)2476(22.4)0.30Endocrine therapy29096(14.6)2903(26.3)Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy476318(43.9)4745(42.9)None9335(12.2)928(8.4)Radiation therapyYes571726(63.4)5691(52.2)0.15No523615(36.6)5221(47.8)Unknown140140Family history of breast cancerYes12947(17.1)1287(11.6)0.28No979934(82.9)9765(88.4)Family history of any cancerYes425619(46.3)4237(38.3)0.29No683722(53.7)6815(61.7)Abbreviations: ER, estrogen receptor;

For the 11052 non-carriers, 4173 patients (37.8%) were treated with BCT, and 6879 patients (62.2%) were treated with mastectomy (Table 1). After a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carriers when treated with BCT (21.1% vs 3.8%, odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a06.7, 95% CI: 2.2\u201320.4, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) (Table 3). No difference in IBTR was found between TP53 carriers and non-carriers when treated with mastectomy (0.0% vs 2.6%, P\u00a0=\u00a01.0) (Table 3). Among the 41 TP53 carriers, the rate of IBTR in patients treated with BCT was significantly higher than that in patients treated with mastectomy (21.1% vs 0.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.038) (Table 3). When patients were restricted to patients with invasive breast cancer, TP53 carriers treated with BCT exhibited a significantly higher rate of IBTR compared with non-carriers treated with BCT (22.2% vs 3.8%, OR\u00a0=\u00a07.2, 95% CI: 2.4\u201322.2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) (Supplementary Table S2).Table 3The rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for TP53 carriers and non-carriers according to different type of surgery.Table 3No.IBTROR(95%CI)P valueN(%)Patients treated with BCT\u00a0TP53 carriers194(21.1)6.7(2.2\u201320.4)0.006\u00a0Non-carriers4173160(3.8)1.0(ref)\u00a0Total4192164(3.9)Patients treated with M\u00a0TP53 carriers220(0.0)\u20131.0\u00a0Non-carriers6879177(2.6)\u2013\u00a0Total6901177(2.6)TP53 carriers\u00a0Treated with BCT194(21.1)\u20130.038\u00a0Treated with M220(0.0)\u2013\u00a0Total414(9.8)Non-carriers\u00a0Treated with BCT4173160(3.8)1.5(1.2\u20131.9)<0.001\u00a0Treated with M6879177(2.6)1.0(ref)\u00a0Total11052337(3.0)Abbreviations: IBTR, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence; OR, odds ratio; ref, reference; BCT, breast-conserving therapy; M, mastectomy.\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        The risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers and non-carriers\n        For the 41 TP53 carriers, 10 (24.4%) developed bilateral breast cancer. Of these 10 patients, 3 (7.3%) were diagnosed with synchronous bilateral breast cancer (bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed simultaneously), and the remaining 7 (17.1%) were diagnosed with asynchronous bilateral breast cancer (contralateral primary breast cancer occurred at least 3 months after the first breast cancer diagnosis). Of these 7 asynchronous bilateral breast cancer patients, the median time from the first breast cancer diagnosis to the development of contralateral breast cancer was 8.1 years (range, 2.9\u201315.4 years). For the 11052 non-carriers, 151 (1.4%) were diagnosed with synchronous bilateral breast cancer, and 316 (2.9%) were diagnosed with asynchronous bilateral breast cancer. The 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carrier (17.9% vs 3.6%, hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a07.0, 95% CI:3.3\u201314.9, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 1). TP53 carriers with early-onset (age \u226430 years) exhibited a higher 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer than those with age over 30 years, although the difference did not reach a significance (31.4% vs 8.0%, adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a02.9, 95% CI: 0.3\u201325.9, P\u00a0=\u00a00.35) (Supplementary Table S3). TP53 carriers with family history of any cancer also had a higher 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer than those without family history of any cancer (30.4% vs 4.8%, adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a06.7, 95% CI: 0.7\u201361.3, P\u00a0=\u00a00.09) (Supplementary Table S3). There was no significant difference in risk of contralateral breast cancer whether TP53 carriers treated with BCT or mastectomy (data not shown).Fig. 1Cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers and non-carriers (patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer were not included).Fig. 1\n5\n      Conclusions\n      We reported that TP53 carriers treated with BCT have a higher risk of IBTR compared with non-carriers treated with BCT, and TP53 carriers treated with BCT have a higher risk of IBTR than those treated with mastectomy. Additionally, TP53 carriers are at a high risk of contralateral breast cancer. Therefore, our study indicates that mastectomy rather than BCT may be more suitable for TP53 variant carriers, and prophylactic contralateral mastectomy may also be taken into consideration when managing the primary breast cancer in TP53 variant carriers.\n1\n      Introduction\n      It is well documented that germline pathogenic variants (referred to as variants hereafter) in the TP53 gene may lead to an autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]], which is characterized by a high risk of developing a broad spectrum of tumors, including soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumor, and adrenocortical cancer. Currently, as next-generation sequencing, i.e., multigene panel testing, is routinely used in clinical practice, many TP53 pathogenic variants outside of LFS or LFL syndrome are being found. We and others reported that the frequency of TP53 pathogenic variant ranges from 0.2% to 0.5% in large cohorts of unselected breast cancer patients [[7], [8], [9]], and TP53 pathogenic variant carriers had poorer survival than non-carriers in unselected breast cancer series [7]. Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is widely applied for operable primary breast cancer. Recent retrospective studies have indicated that BCT is even superior to mastectomy in survival in large series of breast cancer [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. We and others also recently suggested that BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers treated with BCT have comparable survival to those treated with mastectomy with or without radiotherapy [[18], [19], [20]], but BCT might have 2-fold risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence [18]. Therefore, these findings raise a question of whether BCT is associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence in TP53 variant carriers.\n      Women with TP53 pathogenic variants not only face a high risk of developing breast cancer [21,22], but also are at increased risk of second primary breast cancer, particularly in the contralateral breast. A recent study suggested that TP53 variant carriers exhibits a very high risk of contralateral breast cancer [23]. On the other hand, several studies with a limited sample size reported an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence in TP53 variant carriers who had a LFS or LFL syndrome [[24], [25], [26]]. Therefore, the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and contralateral breast cancer should be taken into consideration when TP53 variant carriers received a surgical therapy.\n      In this retrospective study, we analyzed 41 patients with TP53 pathogenic variant from a large series of 11093 breast cancer patients who underwent either BCT or mastectomy. This cohort of patients were largely unselected for age and family history of cancer, and only few TP53 variant carriers had a family history of a LFS or LFL syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and the cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 variant carriers and non-carriers in our cohort.\n2\n      Materials and methods\n      \n        2.1\n        Patients\n        A total of 11873 patients who were treated at the Breast Center, Peking University Cancer Hospital were determined for TP53 germline variants by next-generation sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing. These patients were derived from two cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 10053 consecutive and unselected breast cancer patients from November 17, 2003, to May 29, 2015, as described in our previous study [7]. The mean age (SD) in the first cohort was 51.1 (11.6) years. TP53 germline variants in the first cohort of 10053 patients were detected with a 62-gene panel [27] and/or Sanger sequencing. All TP53 variants detected by 62-gene panel were further validated by a Sanger sequencing, and a substantial number of TP53 variants were independently validated by an additional 560 cancer-related gene panel or whole exome sequencing in blood and/or tumor samples from these TP53 carriers (Supplementary Table S1). The pathogenicity of TP53 variants in the first cohort was revaluated based on the updated criteria. The second cohort was composed of 1820 breast cancer patients from June 1, 2015, to March 19, 2018, and the mean age (SD) in the second cohort was 47.4 (12.3) years. These patients were selected by age at diagnosis or family history of any cancer. Of these 1820 patients, 662 were diagnosed with breast cancer at 30 years or under; 366 were aged over 30 years but less than or equal to 40 years; 792 were patients with a family history of any cancer regardless of the age at diagnosis. TP53 germline variants of these patients were detected by Sanger sequencing by using primers that cover exon 2 to exon 11 (1454 patients) or exon 5 to exon 7 (366 patients) of the TP53 gene. Among the 11873 patients, 780 patients were excluded from this study due to the following reasons: patients with stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis; patients without surgery; patients were treated for local recurrence at the first admission; patients with occult breast cancer but no surgery was performed in breast; patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer but treated with different type of surgery; patients with benign tumor; and patients with a follow-up less than 3 months. Therefore, 11093 breast cancer patients were included in this study (Supplementary Fig. S1). The criteria of LFS or LFL syndrome is described in our previous study [7].\n        In this retrospective study, the patients and physicians were unaware of the TP53 gene status when they selected the surgical procedures. When patients underwent BCT, tumor-free margins were required; the margins were detected via quick frozen section diagnosis during the operation. Data on patients\u2019 clinicopathological characteristics and treatment were obtained from medical records, and the family history of cancer was obtained from medical records and telephone interviews.\n        Patients provided blood samples when they were diagnosed with breast cancer at our institute prior to any treatment, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients whose blood samples could be used for research purposes, including genetic testing.\n        Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) was defined as the reappearance of breast tumor in the ipsilateral breast or chest wall regardless of whether it was true tumor recurrence or a second primary tumor; contralateral breast cancer was defined as a primary breast cancer that occurred in the contralateral breast at least 3 months after the first breast cancer. The endpoint of this study was the date of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, contralateral breast cancer diagnosis, death due to any cause, or date at last follow-up.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        TP53 germline mutation classification\n        Frameshift or nonsense variants that lead to a truncated protein or splice variants affecting the splicing function were considered pathogenic. Missense variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on the current evidence and criteria from the International Agency for Research in Cancer germline and somatic database (IARC, R20, last updated July 2019) [28], the ClinVar database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar), the UMD TP53 database (http://p53.free.fr/Database/p53_database.html), American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines [29], the ClinGen TP53 VCEP specifications [30], and literatures. Only variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were considered pathogenic.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Statistical analysis\n        Pearson \u03c72 test or Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables and the t-test (mean comparisons) for quantitative variables were used to compare the patients' clinicopathological characteristics. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer. The log-rank test was used to compare the differences between curves of the groups. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariable and multivariable analysis, and calculating hazard ratio (HR). P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 21, IBM Corp, USA).\n2.1\n        Patients\n        A total of 11873 patients who were treated at the Breast Center, Peking University Cancer Hospital were determined for TP53 germline variants by next-generation sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing. These patients were derived from two cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 10053 consecutive and unselected breast cancer patients from November 17, 2003, to May 29, 2015, as described in our previous study [7]. The mean age (SD) in the first cohort was 51.1 (11.6) years. TP53 germline variants in the first cohort of 10053 patients were detected with a 62-gene panel [27] and/or Sanger sequencing. All TP53 variants detected by 62-gene panel were further validated by a Sanger sequencing, and a substantial number of TP53 variants were independently validated by an additional 560 cancer-related gene panel or whole exome sequencing in blood and/or tumor samples from these TP53 carriers (Supplementary Table S1). The pathogenicity of TP53 variants in the first cohort was revaluated based on the updated criteria. The second cohort was composed of 1820 breast cancer patients from June 1, 2015, to March 19, 2018, and the mean age (SD) in the second cohort was 47.4 (12.3) years. These patients were selected by age at diagnosis or family history of any cancer. Of these 1820 patients, 662 were diagnosed with breast cancer at 30 years or under; 366 were aged over 30 years but less than or equal to 40 years; 792 were patients with a family history of any cancer regardless of the age at diagnosis. TP53 germline variants of these patients were detected by Sanger sequencing by using primers that cover exon 2 to exon 11 (1454 patients) or exon 5 to exon 7 (366 patients) of the TP53 gene. Among the 11873 patients, 780 patients were excluded from this study due to the following reasons: patients with stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis; patients without surgery; patients were treated for local recurrence at the first admission; patients with occult breast cancer but no surgery was performed in breast; patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer but treated with different type of surgery; patients with benign tumor; and patients with a follow-up less than 3 months. Therefore, 11093 breast cancer patients were included in this study (Supplementary Fig. S1). The criteria of LFS or LFL syndrome is described in our previous study [7].\n        In this retrospective study, the patients and physicians were unaware of the TP53 gene status when they selected the surgical procedures.

P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 21, IBM Corp, USA).\n3.1\n        Clinicopathological characteristics between TP53 carriers and non-carriers in the entire cohort\n        In this cohort of 11093 breast cancer patients, 41 patients (0.37%) carried a TP53 pathogenic variant, while 11052 patients (99.63%) were non-carriers. The rates of TP53 variant were 0.34% in the first cohort and 0.38% in the second cohort, respectively. The age at diagnosis of breast cancer in TP53 carriers were significantly younger than that in non-carriers (mean age at diagnosis, 39.9 vs 50.4, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and TP53 carriers were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and HER2-positive tumors than non-carriers (Table 1). There were no differences in other characteristics between TP53 carriers and non-carriers. This cohort of patients were mainly derived from a series of unselected breast cancer patients (see above methods section). Of these 41 TP53 carriers, only 4 patients met the criteria for LFS or LFL syndrome, and 12 patients met the Chompret revised criteria [31] (Table 2). In addition, three out of 41 TP53 carriers had a personal history of other malignancies, including one developed gastric cancer 3 years after breast cancer diagnosis; one developed thyroid cancer and lung cancer (3 years before breast cancer diagnosis and 1 year after breast cancer diagnosis, respectively); and another one developed sarcoma in the chest wall 12 years after radiotherapy. Detailed information on the clinicopathological characteristics of all 41 TP53 carriers is presented in Table 2. In this study, we found a subset of TP53 carriers with a variant allele frequency (VAF) less than 35% (Table 2). In order to exclude the possibility of mosaicism or clonal hematopoiesis, 13 of 28 TP53 carriers initially detected by 62-gene panel (including 8 patients with initial VAF <35%) were further validated by a 560 cancer-related gene panel or whole exome sequencing (WES) in blood and/or tumor samples from these cases, and an independent Sanger sequencing was performed for all the 28 patients who were detected by the initial 62-gene (Supplementary Table S1). We found that the TP53 variants were presented in the tumor tissues from these TP53 carriers, thus clonal hematopoiesis could be excluded (Supplementary Table S1). However, a few cases (3 cases) still exhibited a VAF <35% but >20% after these validations, we could not exclude the possibility of mosaic mutation for these cases (Supplementary Table S1).Table 1Clinicopathologic characteristics of TP53 carriers and non-carriers in the entire cohort.Table 1CharacteristicsNo.TP53 carriersNon-carriersP valueN(%)N(%)Total1109341(0.37)11052(99.63)Follow-up(years)Median (range)6.7 (0.3\u201318.0)6.8 (1.7\u201316.4)6.7 (0.3\u201318.0)Age at diagnosis(years)Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD50.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.639.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.950.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6<0.001Median (range)49(16\u201398)40(20\u201371)50(16\u201398)\u22643033612(29.3)324(2.9)<0.00131\u20134019709(22.0)1961(17.7)41\u201350358914(34.1)3575(32.3)>5051986(14.6)5192(47.0)Tumor size\u22642\u00a0cm470017(44.7)4683(43.5)0.88>2\u00a0cm610221(55.3)6081(56.5)Unknown2913288Tumor histologyDCIS8907(17.1)883(8.0)0.09IDC895829(70.7)8929(80.8)Other12455(12.2)1240(11.2)Tumor gradea\u21609461(4.0)945(10.6)0.41\u2161648221(84.0)6461(72.8)\u216214733(12.0)1470(16.6)Unknown130291293Lymph node statusNegative685823(59.0)6835(63.4)0.57Positive396916(41.0)3953(36.6)Unknown2662264ER statusNegative296116(41.0)2945(27.1)0.050Positive795723(59.0)7934(72.9)Unknown1752173PR statusNegative355214(35.9)3538(32.6)0.66Positive735425(64.1)7329(67.4)Unknown1872185HER2 statusNegative792222(57.9)7900(74.8)0.017Positive268116(42.1)2665(25.2)Unknown4903487SurgeryBCT419219(46.3)4173(37.8)0.26M690122(53.7)6879(62.2)Adjuvant therapyChemotherapy248812(29.3)2476(22.4)0.30Endocrine therapy29096(14.6)2903(26.3)Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy476318(43.9)4745(42.9)None9335(12.2)928(8.4)Radiation therapyYes571726(63.4)5691(52.2)0.15No523615(36.6)5221(47.8)Unknown140140Family history of breast cancerYes12947(17.1)1287(11.6)0.28No979934(82.9)9765(88.4)Family history of any cancerYes425619(46.3)4237(38.3)0.29No683722(53.7)6815(61.7)Abbreviations: ER, estrogen receptor;

For the 11052 non-carriers, 4173 patients (37.8%) were treated with BCT, and 6879 patients (62.2%) were treated with mastectomy (Table 1). After a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carriers when treated with BCT (21.1% vs 3.8%, odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a06.7, 95% CI: 2.2\u201320.4, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) (Table 3). No difference in IBTR was found between TP53 carriers and non-carriers when treated with mastectomy (0.0% vs 2.6%, P\u00a0=\u00a01.0) (Table 3). Among the 41 TP53 carriers, the rate of IBTR in patients treated with BCT was significantly higher than that in patients treated with mastectomy (21.1% vs 0.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.038) (Table 3). When patients were restricted to patients with invasive breast cancer, TP53 carriers treated with BCT exhibited a significantly higher rate of IBTR compared with non-carriers treated with BCT (22.2% vs 3.8%, OR\u00a0=\u00a07.2, 95% CI: 2.4\u201322.2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) (Supplementary Table S2).Table 3The rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for TP53 carriers and non-carriers according to different type of surgery.Table 3No.IBTROR(95%CI)P valueN(%)Patients treated with BCT\u00a0TP53 carriers194(21.1)6.7(2.2\u201320.4)0.006\u00a0Non-carriers4173160(3.8)1.0(ref)\u00a0Total4192164(3.9)Patients treated with M\u00a0TP53 carriers220(0.0)\u20131.0\u00a0Non-carriers6879177(2.6)\u2013\u00a0Total6901177(2.6)TP53 carriers\u00a0Treated with BCT194(21.1)\u20130.038\u00a0Treated with M220(0.0)\u2013\u00a0Total414(9.8)Non-carriers\u00a0Treated with BCT4173160(3.8)1.5(1.2\u20131.9)<0.001\u00a0Treated with M6879177(2.6)1.0(ref)\u00a0Total11052337(3.0)Abbreviations: IBTR, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence; OR, odds ratio; ref, reference; BCT, breast-conserving therapy; M, mastectomy.\n3.3\n        The risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers and non-carriers\n        For the 41 TP53 carriers, 10 (24.4%) developed bilateral breast cancer. Of these 10 patients, 3 (7.3%) were diagnosed with synchronous bilateral breast cancer (bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed simultaneously), and the remaining 7 (17.1%) were diagnosed with asynchronous bilateral breast cancer (contralateral primary breast cancer occurred at least 3 months after the first breast cancer diagnosis). Of these 7 asynchronous bilateral breast cancer patients, the median time from the first breast cancer diagnosis to the development of contralateral breast cancer was 8.1 years (range, 2.9\u201315.4 years). For the 11052 non-carriers, 151 (1.4%) were diagnosed with synchronous bilateral breast cancer, and 316 (2.9%) were diagnosed with asynchronous bilateral breast cancer. The 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carrier (17.9% vs 3.6%, hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a07.0, 95% CI:3.3\u201314.9, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 1). TP53 carriers with early-onset (age \u226430 years) exhibited a higher 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer than those with age over 30 years, although the difference did not reach a significance (31.4% vs 8.0%, adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a02.9, 95% CI: 0.3\u201325.9, P\u00a0=\u00a00.35) (Supplementary Table S3). TP53 carriers with family history of any cancer also had a higher 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer than those without family history of any cancer (30.4% vs 4.8%, adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a06.7, 95% CI: 0.7\u201361.3, P\u00a0=\u00a00.09) (Supplementary Table S3). There was no significant difference in risk of contralateral breast cancer whether TP53 carriers treated with BCT or mastectomy (data not shown).Fig. 1Cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers and non-carriers (patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer were not included).Fig. 1\n4\n      Discussion\n      In this study, we investigated the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and contralateral breast cancer risk in patients with or without TP53 germline pathogenic variants in a large cohort of 11093 breast cancer patients. We found that the rate of IBTR in TP53 carriers treated with breast conserving therapy (BCT) was significantly higher than that in non-carriers treated with BCT (21.1% vs 3.8%), and the 10-year risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carriers (17.9% vs 3.6%). Furthermore, TP53 carriers treated with BCT exhibited a higher rate of IBTR than those treated mastectomy (21.1% vs 0.0%), but no differences in the risk of contralateral breast cancer between BCT group and mastectomy group. The cohort of TP53 variant carriers was largely derived from unselected breast cancer patients, and the patients and physicians were unaware of the TP53 variant status when the patients were selected to undergo BCT or mastectomy. In addition, of the 41 TP53 variant carriers, only 4 met the criteria for LFS or LFL syndrome. Therefore, our study may reflect the real-world data of TP53 variant carriers in unselected breast cancer patients.\n      BCT is currently widely applied in breast cancer patients worldwide, especially in young women and those with early-stage disease. Recent studies suggested that BCT showed at least equal to or even better survival than mastectomy in large cohorts of breast cancer patients [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Of the 41 TP53 carriers, 46.3% received BCT. This is not surprising, as many TP53 carriers develop breast cancer at a very young age. For TP53 carriers, the rate of IBTR in BCT group was 21.1% compared to none in the mastectomy group, and all the 4 patients who developed IBTR were occurred in the BCT group. We observed that TP53 carriers who developed IBTR were more likely to be very young at onset (all \u226430 years) and harbored ER- and PR-negative tumors. Only one of the 4 carriers had LFS or LFL syndrome, and the remaining 3 carriers did not have LFS or LFL syndrome; thus, IBTR might not be mainly due to LFS or LFL syndrome. Overall, we noted that the rate of IBTR in TP53 carriers treated with BCT was approximately 6.7-fold higher than that in non-carriers treated with BCT. Therefore, a certain of TP53 carriers with high risk of IBTR may not be suitable for undergoing BCT.\n      The 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was 17.9% in this study, and the risk of contralateral breast cancer was comparable to that in BRCA1 (15.5%) and BRCA2 (17.5%) carriers, as reported in our previous study [32]. We also noted that the 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers with very early-onset age (age \u226430 years) was 31.4% in this study. A recent study suggested that 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer was 53.1% in TP53 carriers under the age of 36 years [23]. Therefore, TP53 carriers with early-onset breast cancer might have a high risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. The risk of contralateral breast cancer was not different regardless of whether BCT or mastectomy was performed. Therefore, when we treated primary breast cancer in TP53 carriers, prophylactic contralateral breast mastectomy may be taken into consideration.\n      There are several limitations to this study. First, although we included 41 TP53 pathogenic variant carriers from a large series of breast cancer patients and the sample size was larger than that of many previous studies when considering the low frequency of the TP53 germline variant in unselected breast cancer patients, the sample size was not large enough when stratified by different groups. Second, TP53 germline variants were determined by multi-gene panel and/or Sanger sequencing in this study, and the rearrangements of TP53 gene cannot be detected. Thus, we may underestimate the rate of TP53 mutation. Third, we still found a few cases with a VAF <35% but >20%, therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of mosaic mutation for these cases. As these cases were younger than 45 years at diagnosis, therefore, clonal hematopoiesis is unlikely.\nEthical approval\n      This study was conducted in accordance with the ethics principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Cancer Hospital (Approval number: 2011KT12).\nFunding\n      This work was supported by the 10.13039/501100001809National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 81372832, 81672625, and 81772824].\nRole of the funding source\n      The funder had no role in study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nDeclaration of competing interest\n      The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nAppendix A\n      Supplementary data\n      The following is the Supplementary data to this article:Multimedia component 1Multimedia component 1",
