There was no association between total fat, SFA, MUFA, PUFA and cholesterol intake and breast cancer in the general population and in pre-menopausal women. Conclusion: There was a weak association between high SFA consumption and breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women, however there was high heterogeneity for this analysis.",

    "description": "Objective:\n          To determine if there is an association between total lipid intake, saturated fatty acid (SFA), Poly- and Mono-Unsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA and MUFA) and cholesterol intake and breast cancer risk.\nMaterials and Methods:\n          We conducted a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included all cohort and case-control studies published up to December 2020 with subgroup analysis according to menopausal status.\nResults:\n          We included 44 articles for analysis. There was no association between total fat, SFA, MUFA, PUFA and cholesterol intake and breast cancer in the general population and in pre-menopausal women. In postmenopausal women, high SFA consumption was associated with increased breast cancer risk in case-control studies [relative risk (RR): 1.12; confidence interval (CI) 95%: 1.03\u20131.21; p = 0.006 but not in cohort studies (RR: 1.01; CI 95%: 0.85\u20131.19; p = 0.93).\nConclusion:\n          There was a weak association between high SFA consumption and breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women, however there was high heterogeneity for this analysis. As lipids can have different actions in the same family, studies should rather focus on specific lipid consumption.",
