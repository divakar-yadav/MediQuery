    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      The dynamic and reversible acetylation of protein, catalyzed by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs, also known as HATs) and deacetylases, plays critical roles in a wide range of biological processes including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, signal transduction, stem cell self\u2010renewal, cellular metabolism, and biological rhythm. Lysine acetyltransferases are a highly diverse group of enzymes. Under the action of KATs, the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A is co\u2010 or posttranslationally attached to either the \u03b1\u2010amino group of the N\u2010terminus or the \u03b5\u2010amino group of lysine residues of proteins including both histone and nonhistone proteins.\n1\n, \n2\n To date, more than 30 KATs and KAT candidates have been identified.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n Based on their cellular localization, KATs are classified into types A and B: type A is mainly localized in the nucleus, and type B is localized in the cytoplasm.\n2\n, \n5\n The type A KATs can be further grouped into 5 major families: (i) the GNAT (the GCN5\u2010related acetyltransferase) family that includes KAT2A, KAT2B, and NAT8; (ii) the CBP/p300 family that contains CREBBP and EP300; (iii) the MYST family that includes KAT5, KAT6A, KAT6B, KAT7, and KAT8; (iv) nuclear receptor coactivator family including NCOA1 and NCOA3; and (v) basal transcription factors such as TAF1 and TAF1L.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n In general, KATs and histone acetylation are functionally linked with open chromatin and transcriptional activation.\n4\n In addition to histones, cytoskeletal proteins (eg actin and tubulin) are another crucial family targeted by KATs, including KAT2A and ATAT1. Furthermore, N\u2010terminal acetylation, catalyzed by a family of N\u2010terminal acetyltransferases, including NAA10, NAA50, and NAA60, can influence protein properties including folding, oligomerization, stabilization, and intermolecular interactions.\n6\n, \n7\n\n\n      Alterations of several KATs due to gene mutations, amplifications, deletions, and translocations have been linked directly to devastating human diseases, notably developmental disorders and cancer.\n1\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n8\n, \n9\n Mutations in CREBBP and EP300 have been identified to cause Rubinstein\u2010Taybi syndrome that is characterized by mental retardation, growth retardation, and a particular dysmorphology.\n10\n, \n11\n Dominant mutations in KAT6A (also known as MOZ and MYST3) cause intellectual disability syndrome.\n12\n The X\u2010linked lethal human genetic disorder Ogden syndrome is caused by NAA10 mutations.\n13\n, \n14\n Previous studies also document the existence of a myriad of alterations of KAT genes in both blood and solid tumors. For example, KAT6A is recurrently rearranged and fused to that of CREBBP/EP300 and other partner genes in acute myeloid leukemia.\n15\n, \n16\n Recurrent amplification of the KAT6A and KAT6B genes has been identified in various solid tumors, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cervix cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, colon and rectal adenocarcinomas, and medulloblastoma.9, 15, 17 Nuclear receptor coactivators, including NCOA1 and NCOA3, are overexpressed in breast, prostate, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers where they promote tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance.\n18\n\n\n      The initiation and progression of hematological malignancies and solid tumors have been associated with dysregulation of several KATs. However, our knowledge of the genomic and transcriptomic alterations of KAT genes and the clinical significance of those alterations in human cancer remains incomplete. In the present study, we undertook a metagenomic analysis of KATs in more than 10\u00a0000 cancer samples across 33 tumor types. We then focused on human breast cancer, one of the most common cancers, resulting in more than 450\u00a0000 deaths each year worldwide. We investigated the associations between recurrent copy number alteration (CNA) and gene expression level of each KAT, clinicopathologic features, and disease\u2010free survival of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, loss\u2010of\u2010function assays identified which KAT has important roles in cancer cell growth and survival in vitro. Our studies prioritize a subset of KATs for future research focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Genomic and clinical data on TCGA and METABRIC cancer samples\n        Genetic and expression alteration data from 10\u00a0967 tumor samples spanning 33 tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan\u2010Cancer studies were obtained from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n (http://www.cbioportal.org). In the cBioPortal, the copy number for each KAT gene was generated by the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm and categorized as copy number level per gene: \u22122, possible homozygous deletion; \u22121, heterozygous deletion; 0, diploid; 1, low\u2010level gain; and 2, high\u2010level amplification. The relative expression of an individual gene and the gene\u2019s expression distribution in a reference population were analyzed in mRNA expression data. The reference population consists of tumors that are diploid for the gene in question. The Z score represents the number of standard deviations the expression of a gene is from the reference population gene expression. Somatic mutation data were obtained by exome sequencing.\n19\n, \n20\n Breast cancer subtype and clinicopathologic information were obtained from a previous publication and extracted through cBioPortal.\n19\n, \n23\n Among the 1084 breast cancer samples, 981 had intrinsic subtype data available, including 36 normal\u2010like, 499 luminal A, 197 luminal B, 78 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\u2010enriched (HER2+), and 171 basal\u2010like breast cancers.\n19\n, \n22\n A detailed description of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset can be found in the original publication.\n24\n The CNAs and normalized expression data from the METABRIC database were downloaded with permission from the European Genome\u2010phenome Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega) under accession number EGAC00000000005 as well as from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.\n19\n In the METABRIC dataset, 1974 samples had subtype data available, including 199 normal\u2010like, 718 luminal A, 488 luminal B, 240 HER2+, and 329 basal\u2010like breast cancers.\n24\n\n\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Semiquantitative PCR reactions\n        To assess gene expression at the mRNA level, RNA was prepared from human breast cancer cell lines and the MCF10A cell line by using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).\n21\n RNA was mixed with qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) and then converted to cDNA through an RT reaction. The cDNA was then used for real\u2010time PCR reactions. Primer sets were obtained from Life Technologies. A PUM1 primer set was used as a control. Semiquantitative RT\u2010PCR was carried out using the FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche Diagnostics) as described earlier.\n21\n, \n22\n\n\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Cell culture and growth assays\n        The SUM cell lines were obtained from Dr Stephen P. Ethier, and the remaining cell lines were obtained from ATCC and German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. All cell lines were tested routinely and authenticated using cell morphology, proliferation rate, a panel of genetic markers, and contamination checks. To determine the effect of NAA10 overexpression on the growth of human breast cancer in vitro, NAA10 expression was knocked down using siRNA in human breast cancer cell lines. The siRNAs were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich. We used a MISSION siRNA Universal Negative Control for the negative control group. For the transfection procedure, cells were seeded in appropriate cell culture plates and maintained overnight under standard conditions. Plate sizes, cell densities, and siRNA quantities were dependent on the cell line and the experimental setup; siRNA was transfected using the MISSION siRNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). Expression levels of NAA10 mRNA and protein in knockdown cells were measured by quantitative (q)RT\u2010PCR and western blot assays 48 and 72\u00a0hours after siRNA transfection, respectively. Five days after siRNA transfection, CellTiter\u2010blue cell viability assays (Promega) were undertaken according to the manufacturer\u2019s guideline.\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Immunoblotting and Abs\n        Immunoblot assays were carried out as previously described.\n21\n, \n22\n Whole\u2010cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells from the dishes into cold RIPA lysis buffer. Centrifugation protein content was estimated by the Bradford method. A total of 20\u201050\u00a0\u03bcg of total cell lysate was resolved by SDS\u2010PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Antibodies used for the western blot in the study included anti\u2010NAA10 (1:1000 GTX125971; GeneTex) and anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin (1:5000 A5441; Sigma\u2010Aldrich).\n      \n      \n        2.5\n        Statistical analysis\n        Statistical analyses were undertaken using R software (http://www.r-project.org) and GraphPad Prism (version 6.03).\n21\n, \n22\n Statistical significance of the differences in mRNA expression level for each KAT among different subtypes, stages, and grades of breast cancer samples was determined using ANOVA and Welch\u2019s t test as described earlier.\n21\n, \n22\n Spearman and Pearson correlation tests were used to correlate copy numbers and mRNA levels of each KAT from approximately 10\u00a0000 TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer samples together, as well as 20 individual cancer types that contain at least 200 samples. We used the \u201ccor\u201d function in R for computation, specifying which type of test we wanted (Spearman or Pearson). Relationships between KAT mRNA expression and disease\u2010free survival in METABRIC breast cancer were analyzed by equally dividing 1980 samples into high and low expression groups for each KAT based on mRNA expression Z scores. Thus, there were 990 samples each with high or low expression for each KAT gene. A similar statistical method was also used for survival analysis of individual subtypes of METABRIC cancer patients.\n2.1\n        Genomic and clinical data on TCGA and METABRIC cancer samples\n        Genetic and expression alteration data from 10\u00a0967 tumor samples spanning 33 tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan\u2010Cancer studies were obtained from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n (http://www.cbioportal.org).

A similar statistical method was also used for survival analysis of individual subtypes of METABRIC cancer patients.\n3\n      RESULTS\n      \n        3.1\n        Genomic alterations of KATs across 33 human tumor types\n        Genetic alterations, including CNA and somatic mutation, are a universal hallmark of cancer.\n25\n, \n26\n We hypothesized that KATs with recurrent genetic alterations and mRNA dysregulations play important roles in different types of human tumor, and hence serve as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Based on the current ChromoHub database, the human genome encodes 37 KAT proteins with demonstrated or predicted acetyltransferase activity (Figure S1 and Table\u00a0S1).\n2\n, \n3\n We first analyzed CNAs and mutations in 37 KAT genes compiled from 10\u00a0967 TCGA samples (Pan\u2010Cancer cohort) across 33 divergent tumor types.\n19\n, \n20\n These 33 tumor types include 3 lymphatic and hematologic tumors and 30 solid tumors (Table\u00a0S2). The copy number for each KAT was generated by the copy number analysis algorithm GISTIC and categorized according to copy number level per gene as high\u2010level amplification, low\u2010level gain, diploid, shallow deletion (possibly a heterozygous deletion), and deep deletion (possibly a homozygous deletion). Somatic mutation data were obtained from exome sequencing.\n19\n, \n20\n We will use the term \u201calteration\u201d henceforth for gene amplification, deep deletion, and mutations, including missense mutation, gene truncation, and fusion. In the Pan\u2010Cancer cohort, 42% of the tumors contained an alteration in at least 1 of the 37 KAT genes. Among genomic alterations, KAT6A (3.18%) and NAA10 (1.78%) were the most frequently amplified, and ESCO2 (2.68%) and ELP3 (2.64%) were most frequently deeply deleted (Figure\u00a01A,B). In mutations, 2 pairs of homologs CREBBP (4.65%) and EP300 (4.22%), and TAF1 (3.46%) and TAF1L (4.48%) were the most mutated KATs in the TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer cohort (Figure\u00a01C).\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Heatmap showing the frequencies of lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) (A) amplification (red), (B) deep deletion (blue), and (C) mutations (green) across 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Heatmap was generated using Morpheus software from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). The 33 TCGA tumor types are: breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), mesothelioma (MESO), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), sarcoma (SARC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), uveal melanoma (UVM), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (DLBC), thymoma (THYM) \n          \n          \n        \n        There is considerable variation in the KAT genes altered across different tumor types. We found that 3 KAT genes were amplified in more than 10% of individual TCGA solid tumors; KAT6A was amplified in 17.86% of uterine carcinosarcoma, BRD4 was amplified in 12.06% of ovarian cancer (OV), and ESCO1 was amplified in 10.38% of pancreatic cancer samples (Figure\u00a01A and Table\u00a0S3). The highest percentages of deep deletion were ESCO2 in prostate cancer (6.95%) and OV (6.47%) samples (Figure\u00a01B and Table\u00a0S4). Seven KAT genes (CREBBP, EP300, KAT6A, TAF1, TAF1L, MCM3AP, and CIITA) had mutation frequencies greater than 10% in at least 1 tumor type (Figure\u00a01C and Table\u00a0S5). Notably, CREBBP was mutated in more than 10% of 4 tumor types: bladder cancer (BLCA, 13.41%), uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC, 12.77%), diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (12.20%), and melanoma (SKCM, 1 2.05%). The highest frequency of mutation in TAF1, EP300, and TAF1L is in UCEC (20.12%), BLCA (15.85%), and SKCM (15.45%), respectively. Taken together, among 37 KATs, several KAT genes, including KAT6A, NAA10, CREBBP/EP300, TAF1/TAF1L, ESCO2, and ELP1 had relatively higher frequencies of genetic alterations in a spectrum of human tumors.\n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Mutation profiling of CREBBP/EP300 and TAF1/TAF1L\n        The CBP/p300 (KAT3) subfamily of KATs is composed of 2 homologous enzymes, CREBBP and EP300, both containing a well\u2010conserved acetyltransferase domain and a number of protein interaction domains (eg bromodomain and plant homeodomain) that facilitate binding with over 400 proteins.\n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n CREBBP and EP300 are key transcriptional coactivators that are essential for a multitude of cellular processes.\n27\n Both CREBBP and EP300 were highly mutated (more than 4%) in TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer samples. In 10\u00a0436 TCGA samples with mutation data, there are 629 CREBBP mutations, including 451 missense, 148 truncating, 8 in\u2010frame, and 22 fusion mutations. The most mutated site of CREBBP was R1446 (15 samples with missense mutation) which is located at the KAT enzymatic domain (Figure\u00a02). For EP300, there are 556 mutations, including 378 missense, 159 truncating, 5 in\u2010frame, and 14 fusion mutations. The most mutated residue of EP300 was D1399, which also is located at the KAT enzymatic domain (Figure\u00a02).\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Mutational spectra of CREBBP, EP300, TAF1, and TAF1L in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan\u2010Cancers. Images show protein domains and the positions of somatic mutations in CREBBP, EP300, TAF1, and TAF1L in TCGA Pan\u2010Cancers. Red dot, nonsense mutation, frameshift deletion, insertion, or splice; green dot, missense mutation; black dot, in\u2010frame insertion or deletion\n          \n          \n        \n        The TAF1 gene encodes the largest subunit of the transcription factor II D complex, which promotes transcriptional initiation and activation.\n30\n The TAF1 homologue TAF1L has 95% amino acid identity with TAF1.\n31\n In TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer, there are 477 TAF1 mutations, including 418 missense, 54 truncating, 4 in\u2010frame, and 1 fusion mutations. R869, which is located at the putative histone acetyltransferase domain of TAF1, had the highest frequency (9 mutations) of mutations (Figure\u00a02). For TAF1L, there are 625 mutations, 565 missense, 58 truncating, 1 in\u2010frame, and 1 fusion mutations. R658, R1205, and R1252 have mostly missense mutations (Figure\u00a02). Together, 4 KAT genes (CREBBP, EP300, TAF1, and TAF1L) had higher frequencies of somatic mutation, and enriched mutation sites likely have an effect on their KAT activities.\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Copy number and expression profiling of KATs in different subtypes of breast cancer\n        Breast cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer death among women. Using gene expression profiling, breast cancer has been classified into 5 intrinsic subtypes with distinct risks and underlying biology; these 5 subtypes are luminal A, luminal B, HER2+, basal\u2010like, and normal\u2010like breast cancers.\n23\n, \n32\n One of the KATs, MAPT, is in the PAM50 (prediction analysis for microarray 50) gene panel for classifying the 5 subtypes of breast cancer. To determine whether the genetic alteration or mRNA expression of other KATs is specific to a breast cancer subtype, we analyzed CNA and mRNA expression independently across 5 subtypes of breast cancer samples.\n20\n The frequencies of high\u2010level amplification, low\u2010level gain, diploid, heterozygous deletions, homozygous deletions, and somatic mutation of 37 KAT genes in 5 TCGA breast cancer subtypes are shown in Table\u00a0S6. Notably, KAT6A was amplified in 7.62% of luminal A, 9.64% of luminal B, 5.13% of HER2+, and 11.11% of basal subtypes of breast cancer. Additionally, ELP3 and ESCO2 also showed the highest frequency of homologous deletion in luminal B and basal\u2010like subtypes (Table\u00a0S6). We also noted that CREBBP had the highest frequency (7.02%) of mutation in basal\u2010like breast cancer (Table\u00a0S6).\n        Next, we analyzed the correlation between copy number and mRNA level of 37 KATs from TCGA samples (Table\u00a0S7). In the Pan\u2010Cancer analysis, 36 of 37 KATs have positive correlation between mRNA and DNA copy number in both Spearman and Pearson correlation, with 23 KATs having both Spearman and Pearson coefficients greater than 0.3. Based on the means of Spearman coefficient of all KATs, we found that BRCA, OV, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma had relatively higher positive correlation coefficient, whereas thyroid carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia had lower positive correlation coefficient (Table\u00a0S7 and Figure S2). These data suggested that CNA could be a major factor in the dysregulation of several KAT mRNAs in human cancer, including breast cancer. We also found that different subtypes of breast cancer had different patterns of expression for each KAT gene. Consistently with previous studies, we revealed that MAPT was significantly underexpressed, whereas BRD4 was significantly overexpressed in estrogen receptor\u2010 negative (ER\u2010), basal\u2010like breast cancer (Table\u00a0S8). In addition to BRD4, we found that 8 KATs, including NAA10 and ACAT2, were also significantly higher expressed (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05, mean Z score difference greater than 0.5) in basal\u2010like compared with luminal subtypes, and 11 genes including KAT6A, KAT6B, KAT7, and NCOA3 showed lower expression in basal\u2010like subtype breast cancer (Figure\u00a03A and Table\u00a0S8).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Expression levels of 4 lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), NAA10, ACAT2, KAT6A, and KAT8, in breast cancers grouped by subtype, grade, and Nottingham prognostic index (NPI). A, Expression levels of 4 KATs across 5 subtypes of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer samples. B, Expression levels of 4 KATs across 5 subtypes of Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) breast cancer samples. NAA10 and ACAT2 were expressed at significantly higher levels (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in basal\u2010like compared with luminal subtypes. C, Expression levels of 4 KATs in 3 grades of METABRIC breast cancer samples. D, Expression levels of 4 KATs in METABRIC patients with a poor prognosis (NPI\u00a0>\u00a03.4) and good prognosis (NPI\u00a0\u2264\u00a03.4) scores. High expression of NAA10 and ACAT2, but not KAT6A and KAT8, were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) associated with high grade and poor prognosis of METABRIC breast cancers\n          \n          \n        \n        To validate our findings from TCGA breast cancer dataset regarding KAT genetic alterations, we undertook an independent analysis using the METABRIC dataset, which contains 2509 breast cancer samples with long\u2010term clinical follow\u2010up data.\n24\n We found that KAT6A had the highest frequency (10.81%) of high\u2010level amplification in the METABRIC breast cancer samples (Table\u00a0S9). Among 37 KAT genes, 3 genes, EP300, TAF1, and NCOA3, had been selected for the mutation analysis with the frequencies of 2.75%, 2.07%, and 1.63%, respectively, in METABRIC breast cancer samples.\n33\n For mRNA expression, data for 33 KATs were available (mRNA data of BLOC1S1, CIITA, NAT8B, and NAT8L were not available) in the METABRIC dataset. Again, we found that 3 KATs (NAA10, ACAT2, and DLAT) had significantly higher expression (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05, mean Z score difference greater than 0.5), whereas 5 KATs (MAPT, CREBBP, EP300, KAT6B, KAT8, and NAA60) were underexpressed in METABRIC basal\u2010like subtypes compared with luminal subtypes (Figure\u00a03B and Table\u00a0S10).\n      \n      \n        3.4\n        Association of KAT gene expression with clinical features and survival of breast cancer patients\n        We next investigated the clinical relevance of KAT expressions in the METABRIC cohort, as the METABRIC breast cancers have long\u2010term clinical follow\u2010up data. We first examined expression levels of each KAT gene at different grades of METABRIC breast cancer samples. The means of Z score and P value for each KAT gene across grades 1\u20103 are shown in Table\u00a0S11. We found that 3 genes, NAA10, ACAT2, and NCOA3 were significantly highly expressed in higher\u2010grade breast cancers (t test: grade 3 vs 1\u00a0+\u00a02; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and means difference greater than 0.4; Figure\u00a03C and Table\u00a0S11). The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI), a clinicopathologic classification system based on tumor size, histological grade, and lymph node status that is widely used in Europe for breast cancer prognostication, was also available in the METABRIC cohort.\n34\n Thus, we compared expression levels of KATs between patients with high NPI (greater than 3.4) vs those with low NPI (3.4 or less). As shown in Figure\u00a03D and Table\u00a0S11, 3 KATs, NAA10, ACAT2, and NCOA3, were significantly overexpressed, whereas ELP3 and MAPT were underexpressed in samples with higher NPI (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and means Z score difference greater than 0.4) compared with that in lower NPI samples.\n35\n Next, we analyzed the relationship between KAT mRNA expression and disease\u2010free survival of METABRIC breast cancer patients. We found that higher mRNA levels of 4 KATs (ACAT2, BRD4, NAA10, and NCOA3) and lower expression of 5 KATs (MAPT, ACAT1, ELP3, KAT2A, and KAT8) were significantly associated with shorter disease\u2010free survival in METABRIC breast cancer patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.005) (Figures\u00a04A and S3, and Table\u00a0S12).\n35\n We also undertook survival analysis of KATs in different subtypes of breast cancer. As shown in Table\u00a0S12, we found that higher expression of BRD4 was significantly associated with shorter disease\u2010free survival in basal\u2010like and luminal B subtypes, whereas lower expression of MAPT and ACAT1 was significantly 3 with shorter disease\u2010free survival in luminal A patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). In summary, we found that three KATs, NAA10, ACAT2, and BRD4, were highly expressed in the aggressive basal\u2010like subtype, and NCOA3 was highly expressed in luminal B subtype, and several KATs (eg BRD4 and NAA10) were significantly associated with tumor grade and disease\u2010free survival of breast cancers.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n             Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) associated with disease\u2010free survival of breast cancer and contributed to growth and viability of tumor cells in vitro.

For the survival analysis, we equally divided 1980 METABRIC samples into high and low expression groups for each KAT based on mRNA expression Z scores. B, Scatter plot showing mean of each KAT dependency score in genome\u2010scale loss\u2010of\u2010function screens of 712 tumor lines\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.5\n        Potential role of NAA10 in breast cancer proliferation\n        The availability of multiple datasets comprising genome\u2010scale RNAi viability screens in hundreds of diverse cancer cell lines presents new opportunities for understanding cancer vulnerabilities.\n36\n, \n37\n To determine how endogenous KATs contribute to growth and viability of tumor cells, we analyzed a genome\u2010wide loss\u2010of\u2010function shRNA screen in 712 tumor lines (https://depmap.org/portal/).\n36\n, \n38\n, \n39\n We ranked average dependency (DEMETER2) scores of all 37 KATs and revealed that 6 of them, notably MCM3AP, NAA10 and BRD4, have average DEMETER2 scores of less than \u22120.5 (lower score means more dependency on target) (Figure\u00a04B).\n40\n Given that NAA10 was overexpressed in advanced stage, higher grade, and basal\u2010like breast cancer, we undertook a more detailed analysis of NAA10 shRNA screen data in breast cancer cell lines. Among 80 breast cancer lines, 63 lines have DEMETER2 scores of less than \u22120.5, and among them, 10 lines have scores of less than \u22121.0 (Table\u00a0S13).\n        Next, we carried out qRT\u2010PCR and western blot assays to measure NAA10 in 22 breast cancer cell lines. Compared with MCF10A, an immortalized but nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, mRNA levels of NAA10 were highly expressed in 13 lines, particularly the basal\u2010like subtype lines including SUM149, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, and SUM1315 (Figure\u00a05A). Expression levels of the NAA10 protein were also higher in basal\u2010like breast cancer lines (Figure\u00a05B). To confirm the results of genome\u2010wide RNAi screens in cancer cell lines, we examined the effects of knocking down NAA10 in SUM149, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, and SUM1315 basal\u2010like breast cancer lines. We obtained 3 siRNAs targeting different regions of NAA10 gene. Quantitative RT\u2010PCR and western blot assays revealed that 2 siRNAs significantly decreased the expression of NAA10 at mRNA and protein levels (Figures\u00a05C and S4). As shown in Figure\u00a05C, NAA10 knockdown dramatically slowed SUM149 cell growth to approximately 40% of the growth of the nonsilenced control. NAA10 knockdown also modularly, but statistically significantly, slowed MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 and SUM1315 growth (Figure\u00a05C). Our genomic, clinical, and in vitro cellular data suggest that NAA10 has a potential role in promoting breast cancer growth and progression.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Knockdown of NAA10 inhibits cell proliferation and survival in breast cancer cell lines.

Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\n3.1\n        Genomic alterations of KATs across 33 human tumor types\n        Genetic alterations, including CNA and somatic mutation, are a universal hallmark of cancer.\n25\n, \n26\n We hypothesized that KATs with recurrent genetic alterations and mRNA dysregulations play important roles in different types of human tumor, and hence serve as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Based on the current ChromoHub database, the human genome encodes 37 KAT proteins with demonstrated or predicted acetyltransferase activity (Figure S1 and Table\u00a0S1).\n2\n, \n3\n We first analyzed CNAs and mutations in 37 KAT genes compiled from 10\u00a0967 TCGA samples (Pan\u2010Cancer cohort) across 33 divergent tumor types.\n19\n, \n20\n These 33 tumor types include 3 lymphatic and hematologic tumors and 30 solid tumors (Table\u00a0S2). The copy number for each KAT was generated by the copy number analysis algorithm GISTIC and categorized according to copy number level per gene as high\u2010level amplification, low\u2010level gain, diploid, shallow deletion (possibly a heterozygous deletion), and deep deletion (possibly a homozygous deletion). Somatic mutation data were obtained from exome sequencing.\n19\n, \n20\n We will use the term \u201calteration\u201d henceforth for gene amplification, deep deletion, and mutations, including missense mutation, gene truncation, and fusion. In the Pan\u2010Cancer cohort, 42% of the tumors contained an alteration in at least 1 of the 37 KAT genes. Among genomic alterations, KAT6A (3.18%) and NAA10 (1.78%) were the most frequently amplified, and ESCO2 (2.68%) and ELP3 (2.64%) were most frequently deeply deleted (Figure\u00a01A,B). In mutations, 2 pairs of homologs CREBBP (4.65%) and EP300 (4.22%), and TAF1 (3.46%) and TAF1L (4.48%) were the most mutated KATs in the TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer cohort (Figure\u00a01C).\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Heatmap showing the frequencies of lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) (A) amplification (red), (B) deep deletion (blue), and (C) mutations (green) across 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Heatmap was generated using Morpheus software from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). The 33 TCGA tumor types are: breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), mesothelioma (MESO), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), sarcoma (SARC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), uveal melanoma (UVM), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (DLBC), thymoma (THYM) \n          \n          \n        \n        There is considerable variation in the KAT genes altered across different tumor types. We found that 3 KAT genes were amplified in more than 10% of individual TCGA solid tumors; KAT6A was amplified in 17.86% of uterine carcinosarcoma, BRD4 was amplified in 12.06% of ovarian cancer (OV), and ESCO1 was amplified in 10.38% of pancreatic cancer samples (Figure\u00a01A and Table\u00a0S3). The highest percentages of deep deletion were ESCO2 in prostate cancer (6.95%) and OV (6.47%) samples (Figure\u00a01B and Table\u00a0S4). Seven KAT genes (CREBBP, EP300, KAT6A, TAF1, TAF1L, MCM3AP, and CIITA) had mutation frequencies greater than 10% in at least 1 tumor type (Figure\u00a01C and Table\u00a0S5). Notably, CREBBP was mutated in more than 10% of 4 tumor types: bladder cancer (BLCA, 13.41%), uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC, 12.77%), diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (12.20%), and melanoma (SKCM, 1 2.05%). The highest frequency of mutation in TAF1, EP300, and TAF1L is in UCEC (20.12%), BLCA (15.85%), and SKCM (15.45%), respectively. Taken together, among 37 KATs, several KAT genes, including KAT6A, NAA10, CREBBP/EP300, TAF1/TAF1L, ESCO2, and ELP1 had relatively higher frequencies of genetic alterations in a spectrum of human tumors.\n3.2\n        Mutation profiling of CREBBP/EP300 and TAF1/TAF1L\n        The CBP/p300 (KAT3) subfamily of KATs is composed of 2 homologous enzymes, CREBBP and EP300, both containing a well\u2010conserved acetyltransferase domain and a number of protein interaction domains (eg bromodomain and plant homeodomain) that facilitate binding with over 400 proteins.\n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n CREBBP and EP300 are key transcriptional coactivators that are essential for a multitude of cellular processes.\n27\n Both CREBBP and EP300 were highly mutated (more than 4%) in TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer samples. In 10\u00a0436 TCGA samples with mutation data, there are 629 CREBBP mutations, including 451 missense, 148 truncating, 8 in\u2010frame, and 22 fusion mutations. The most mutated site of CREBBP was R1446 (15 samples with missense mutation) which is located at the KAT enzymatic domain (Figure\u00a02). For EP300, there are 556 mutations, including 378 missense, 159 truncating, 5 in\u2010frame, and 14 fusion mutations. The most mutated residue of EP300 was D1399, which also is located at the KAT enzymatic domain (Figure\u00a02).\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Mutational spectra of CREBBP, EP300, TAF1, and TAF1L in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan\u2010Cancers. Images show protein domains and the positions of somatic mutations in CREBBP, EP300, TAF1, and TAF1L in TCGA Pan\u2010Cancers. Red dot, nonsense mutation, frameshift deletion, insertion, or splice; green dot, missense mutation; black dot, in\u2010frame insertion or deletion\n          \n          \n        \n        The TAF1 gene encodes the largest subunit of the transcription factor II D complex, which promotes transcriptional initiation and activation.\n30\n The TAF1 homologue TAF1L has 95% amino acid identity with TAF1.\n31\n In TCGA Pan\u2010Cancer, there are 477 TAF1 mutations, including 418 missense, 54 truncating, 4 in\u2010frame, and 1 fusion mutations. R869, which is located at the putative histone acetyltransferase domain of TAF1, had the highest frequency (9 mutations) of mutations (Figure\u00a02). For TAF1L, there are 625 mutations, 565 missense, 58 truncating, 1 in\u2010frame, and 1 fusion mutations. R658, R1205, and R1252 have mostly missense mutations (Figure\u00a02). Together, 4 KAT genes (CREBBP, EP300, TAF1, and TAF1L) had higher frequencies of somatic mutation, and enriched mutation sites likely have an effect on their KAT activities.\n3.3\n        Copy number and expression profiling of KATs in different subtypes of breast cancer\n        Breast cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer death among women. Using gene expression profiling, breast cancer has been classified into 5 intrinsic subtypes with distinct risks and underlying biology; these 5 subtypes are luminal A, luminal B, HER2+, basal\u2010like, and normal\u2010like breast cancers.\n23\n, \n32\n One of the KATs, MAPT, is in the PAM50 (prediction analysis for microarray 50) gene panel for classifying the 5 subtypes of breast cancer. To determine whether the genetic alteration or mRNA expression of other KATs is specific to a breast cancer subtype, we analyzed CNA and mRNA expression independently across 5 subtypes of breast cancer samples.\n20\n The frequencies of high\u2010level amplification, low\u2010level gain, diploid, heterozygous deletions, homozygous deletions, and somatic mutation of 37 KAT genes in 5 TCGA breast cancer subtypes are shown in Table\u00a0S6. Notably, KAT6A was amplified in 7.62% of luminal A, 9.64% of luminal B, 5.13% of HER2+, and 11.11% of basal subtypes of breast cancer. Additionally, ELP3 and ESCO2 also showed the highest frequency of homologous deletion in luminal B and basal\u2010like subtypes (Table\u00a0S6). We also noted that CREBBP had the highest frequency (7.02%) of mutation in basal\u2010like breast cancer (Table\u00a0S6).\n        Next, we analyzed the correlation between copy number and mRNA level of 37 KATs from TCGA samples (Table\u00a0S7). In the Pan\u2010Cancer analysis, 36 of 37 KATs have positive correlation between mRNA and DNA copy number in both Spearman and Pearson correlation, with 23 KATs having both Spearman and Pearson coefficients greater than 0.3. Based on the means of Spearman coefficient of all KATs, we found that BRCA, OV, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma had relatively higher positive correlation coefficient, whereas thyroid carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia had lower positive correlation coefficient (Table\u00a0S7 and Figure S2). These data suggested that CNA could be a major factor in the dysregulation of several KAT mRNAs in human cancer, including breast cancer. We also found that different subtypes of breast cancer had different patterns of expression for each KAT gene. Consistently with previous studies, we revealed that MAPT was significantly underexpressed, whereas BRD4 was significantly overexpressed in estrogen receptor\u2010 negative (ER\u2010), basal\u2010like breast cancer (Table\u00a0S8). In addition to BRD4, we found that 8 KATs, including NAA10 and ACAT2, were also significantly higher expressed (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05, mean Z score difference greater than 0.5) in basal\u2010like compared with luminal subtypes, and 11 genes including KAT6A, KAT6B, KAT7, and NCOA3 showed lower expression in basal\u2010like subtype breast cancer (Figure\u00a03A and Table\u00a0S8).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Expression levels of 4 lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), NAA10, ACAT2, KAT6A, and KAT8, in breast cancers grouped by subtype, grade, and Nottingham prognostic index (NPI).

B, Expression levels of 4 KATs across 5 subtypes of Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) breast cancer samples. NAA10 and ACAT2 were expressed at significantly higher levels (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in basal\u2010like compared with luminal subtypes. C, Expression levels of 4 KATs in 3 grades of METABRIC breast cancer samples. D, Expression levels of 4 KATs in METABRIC patients with a poor prognosis (NPI\u00a0>\u00a03.4) and good prognosis (NPI\u00a0\u2264\u00a03.4) scores. High expression of NAA10 and ACAT2, but not KAT6A and KAT8, were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) associated with high grade and poor prognosis of METABRIC breast cancers\n          \n          \n        \n        To validate our findings from TCGA breast cancer dataset regarding KAT genetic alterations, we undertook an independent analysis using the METABRIC dataset, which contains 2509 breast cancer samples with long\u2010term clinical follow\u2010up data.\n24\n We found that KAT6A had the highest frequency (10.81%) of high\u2010level amplification in the METABRIC breast cancer samples (Table\u00a0S9). Among 37 KAT genes, 3 genes, EP300, TAF1, and NCOA3, had been selected for the mutation analysis with the frequencies of 2.75%, 2.07%, and 1.63%, respectively, in METABRIC breast cancer samples.\n33\n For mRNA expression, data for 33 KATs were available (mRNA data of BLOC1S1, CIITA, NAT8B, and NAT8L were not available) in the METABRIC dataset. Again, we found that 3 KATs (NAA10, ACAT2, and DLAT) had significantly higher expression (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05, mean Z score difference greater than 0.5), whereas 5 KATs (MAPT, CREBBP, EP300, KAT6B, KAT8, and NAA60) were underexpressed in METABRIC basal\u2010like subtypes compared with luminal subtypes (Figure\u00a03B and Table\u00a0S10).\n3.4\n        Association of KAT gene expression with clinical features and survival of breast cancer patients\n        We next investigated the clinical relevance of KAT expressions in the METABRIC cohort, as the METABRIC breast cancers have long\u2010term clinical follow\u2010up data. We first examined expression levels of each KAT gene at different grades of METABRIC breast cancer samples. The means of Z score and P value for each KAT gene across grades 1\u20103 are shown in Table\u00a0S11. We found that 3 genes, NAA10, ACAT2, and NCOA3 were significantly highly expressed in higher\u2010grade breast cancers (t test: grade 3 vs 1\u00a0+\u00a02; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and means difference greater than 0.4; Figure\u00a03C and Table\u00a0S11). The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI), a clinicopathologic classification system based on tumor size, histological grade, and lymph node status that is widely used in Europe for breast cancer prognostication, was also available in the METABRIC cohort.\n34\n Thus, we compared expression levels of KATs between patients with high NPI (greater than 3.4) vs those with low NPI (3.4 or less). As shown in Figure\u00a03D and Table\u00a0S11, 3 KATs, NAA10, ACAT2, and NCOA3, were significantly overexpressed, whereas ELP3 and MAPT were underexpressed in samples with higher NPI (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and means Z score difference greater than 0.4) compared with that in lower NPI samples.\n35\n Next, we analyzed the relationship between KAT mRNA expression and disease\u2010free survival of METABRIC breast cancer patients. We found that higher mRNA levels of 4 KATs (ACAT2, BRD4, NAA10, and NCOA3) and lower expression of 5 KATs (MAPT, ACAT1, ELP3, KAT2A, and KAT8) were significantly associated with shorter disease\u2010free survival in METABRIC breast cancer patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.005) (Figures\u00a04A and S3, and Table\u00a0S12).\n35\n We also undertook survival analysis of KATs in different subtypes of breast cancer. As shown in Table\u00a0S12, we found that higher expression of BRD4 was significantly associated with shorter disease\u2010free survival in basal\u2010like and luminal B subtypes, whereas lower expression of MAPT and ACAT1 was significantly 3 with shorter disease\u2010free survival in luminal A patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). In summary, we found that three KATs, NAA10, ACAT2, and BRD4, were highly expressed in the aggressive basal\u2010like subtype, and NCOA3 was highly expressed in luminal B subtype, and several KATs (eg BRD4 and NAA10) were significantly associated with tumor grade and disease\u2010free survival of breast cancers.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n             Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) associated with disease\u2010free survival of breast cancer and contributed to growth and viability of tumor cells in vitro.

For the survival analysis, we equally divided 1980 METABRIC samples into high and low expression groups for each KAT based on mRNA expression Z scores.

Among 80 breast cancer lines, 63 lines have DEMETER2 scores of less than \u22120.5, and among them, 10 lines have scores of less than \u22121.0 (Table\u00a0S13).\n        Next, we carried out qRT\u2010PCR and western blot assays to measure NAA10 in 22 breast cancer cell lines. Compared with MCF10A, an immortalized but nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, mRNA levels of NAA10 were highly expressed in 13 lines, particularly the basal\u2010like subtype lines including SUM149, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, and SUM1315 (Figure\u00a05A). Expression levels of the NAA10 protein were also higher in basal\u2010like breast cancer lines (Figure\u00a05B). To confirm the results of genome\u2010wide RNAi screens in cancer cell lines, we examined the effects of knocking down NAA10 in SUM149, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, and SUM1315 basal\u2010like breast cancer lines. We obtained 3 siRNAs targeting different regions of NAA10 gene. Quantitative RT\u2010PCR and western blot assays revealed that 2 siRNAs significantly decreased the expression of NAA10 at mRNA and protein levels (Figures\u00a05C and S4). As shown in Figure\u00a05C, NAA10 knockdown dramatically slowed SUM149 cell growth to approximately 40% of the growth of the nonsilenced control. NAA10 knockdown also modularly, but statistically significantly, slowed MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 and SUM1315 growth (Figure\u00a05C). Our genomic, clinical, and in vitro cellular data suggest that NAA10 has a potential role in promoting breast cancer growth and progression.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Knockdown of NAA10 inhibits cell proliferation and survival in breast cancer cell lines.

Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\n4\n      DISCUSSION\n      Here, we describe the genomic and functional analysis of 37 KATs in a large cohort of human cancer primary samples and cell lines. Our Pan\u2010Cancer analysis showed that several KAT genes, including KAT6A, NAA10, CREBBP/EP300, and TAF1/TAF1L have relatively higher frequencies of genetic alterations in various human cancers. Next, we undertook integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses of KAT genes in breast cancer with different molecular subtypes and clinicopathologic features. We identified that a subset of KAT genes, notably KAT6A and NAA10, are commonly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Different subtypes of breast cancer had different patterns of copy number and expression of each KAT. Importantly, we found that 3 KATs, NAA10, ACAT2, and BRD4, were highly expressed in the aggressive basal\u2010like subtype, and their expression was significantly associated with disease\u2010free survival. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of NAA10 inhibits basal\u2010like breast cancer growth, suggesting NAA10 has oncogenic potential in breast cancer.\n      Among 37 KATs, the KAT6A gene (located at 8p11.21) had the highest frequency of amplification in both TCGA Pan\u2010Caner and METABRIC breast cohorts. Notably, more than 5% of breast, uterine, lung squamous, esophageal, and bladder cancers have KAT6A amplification. These data agree with and consolidate prior reports on the genetic alterations and oncogenic potentials of KAT6A in human cancer.\n17\n, \n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n For example, Turner\u2010Ivey et al suggested that KAT6A is a candidate oncogene in luminal breast cancer.\n41\n Furthermore, Yu et al found that KAT6A activates ER\u03b1 promoter through its histone acetyltransferase function.\n44\n In this study, we also found that KAT6A was highly amplified and overexpressed in a subset of ER\u2010, basal\u2010like breast cancers. Very recently, Baell and colleagues identified novel competitive KAT6A inhibitors, WM\u20108014 and WM\u20101119, which induce cell cycle exit and senescence and are effective in preventing the progression of lymphoma in mice.\n45\n It will be interesting to test KAT6A inhibitors in human cancer models with KAT6A amplification in the future.\n      \nCREBBP and EP300 (CBP/p300) are the most mutated KATs in human cancer. It is possible that compensatory mechanisms exist among different KATs in different cell types and functional states. However, previous studies on KAT\u2010null and heterozygous mice have revealed highly specific functions of individual enzymes in development, physiology, and disease.\n5\n, \n46\n Studies using CBP/p300 conditional knockout mice reveal a distinct role for CREBBP and EP300 in defined cell lineages.\n47\n Many studies indicated that CBP/p300 function as tumor suppressors.\n27\n Furthermore, CBP/p300 might contribute to DNA repair through histone acetylation and facilitate the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the site of damage.\n48\n Our finding, together with others, indicate that the KAT domains of CREBBP and EP300 are hotspots for mutation in human cancer, suggesting the critical roles of KAT function of CREBBP/EP300 in regulating tumor growth and progression.\n27\n\n\n      Genome\u2010scale shRNA viability screens in human cancer cell lines revealed that, among KATs, MCM3AP, NAA10, and BRD4 have the strongest preferential dependency (Figure\u00a04B). The MCM3AP gene is mutated in 2.36% of TCGA samples, with the highest frequency of mutation (10.06%) in UCEC. The majority of MCM3AP mutations in UCEC tumor were missense. The MCM3AP acetylates MCM3, a highly conserved minichromosome maintenance protein, which is involved in the initiation of genome replication.\n49\n Interestingly, 1 UCEC line, called EN, with the MCM3AP mutation has the lowest DEMETER2 score in genome\u2010scale shRNA viability screens of human cancer cell lines (https://depmap.org/portal/). Therefore, it is worth investigating the functional roles of MCM3AP mutation in human cancer, particularly UCEC, and whether it is a novel therapeutic target for UCEC in the future. The functional roles of BRD4 in cancer have been intensively studied; BRD4 plays critical roles in superenhancer organization and oncogene expression regulation.\n50\n It was recently reported that BRD4 has intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, although the functional significance of this activity to the function of BRD4 remains to be further investigated.\n51\n Nevertheless, BRD4 is currently regarded as one of the most promising new drug targets for both hematological and solid tumors.\n50\n, \n52\n\n\n      N\u2010terminal acetylation impacts the modulations of protein\u2010protein interactions, protein subcellular targeting, folding, stabilization, and degradation.\n7\n NAA10 is the catalytic subunit of the N\u2010terminal acetyltransferase NatA complex, which includes NAA10, NAA15, and NAA50.\n7\n\u00a0N\u2010terminal acetylation activity by NAA10 was found to relate strongly to human genetic disease, notably Ogden syndrome.\n13\n, \n14\n Studies revealed that Naa10\u2010null mice display partial embryonic lethality, growth retardation, brain disorders, and maternal effect lethality.\n53\n In addition, NAA10 can act independently to posttranslationally acetylate a distinct set of substrates, including histone and actin.\n7\n Previous studies also showed that NAA10 regulates cell proliferation and cancer formation, DNA damage response, hypoxia, bone formation, and neuronal development in enzymatic activity\u2010dependent and \u2010independent manners.\n54\n Our functional study revealed that NAA10 is critical for cancer cell growth and survival, particularly aggressive, basal\u2010like breast cancer. It is important to deeply investigate NAA10 function in different subtypes of breast cancer by overexpressing NAA10 in model cells in the future.\n      In summary, we undertook a large\u2010scale genomic analysis of 37 KATs in human cancer, focusing on breast cancer. We found that KAT6A and NAA10 were the most commonly amplified and CREBBP/EP300 and TAF1/TAF1L were most often mutated in a spectrum of human cancers. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and clinicopathologic data in breast cancers revealed that several KATs, including NAA10, ACAT2, and BRD4, were significantly associated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis of patients. Loss\u2010of\u2010function analysis revealed that NAA10 had important roles in promoting cancer cell growth and survival. Our findings provide a strong foundation for further mechanistic research and for developing therapies that target NAA10 or other KATs in human cancer. Given that many cellular factors can be regulated by KATs, and KATs act in a highly context\u2010specific and cell type\u2010dependent manner, care is required when choosing KAT inhibitors against a specific type of cancer.\nDISCLOSURE\n      The authors have no conflict of interest.\nSupporting information\n      \n        \n          Fig S1\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Fig S2\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Fig S3\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Fig S4\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S1\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S2\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S3\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S4\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S5\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S6\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S7\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S8\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S9\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S10\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S11\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S12\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Table S13\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.",
