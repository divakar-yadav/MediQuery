    "description": "1\n      BACKGROUND\n      Estrogen receptor (ER) status plays an essential role in making clinical decisions and predicting outcomes for invasive breast cancer patients [1]. In general, patients with ER\u2010positive tumors are considered eligible for endocrine therapy. In contrast, patients with ER\u2010negative tumors are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy and usually have a worse outcome than the former [2, 3, 4].\n      Ligand\u2010binding assays (LBA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are the two most used assays to measure ER expression. With the development of ER assessment and clinical prevalence for biomarkers, a previous consensus had been reached that tumors with \u226510% nuclear staining by IHC [1, 5] should be considered ER\u2010positive and, therefore, eligible for endocrine therapy. However, it was reported that breast cancer patients with lower ER expression (a total IHC score of 3, corresponding to 1%\u201010% weakly positive cells) could also benefit from endocrine therapy [6]. The 1% nuclear staining cutoff was based on the concordance analysis with reverse\u2010transcription PCR in E2197 clinical trial [7], and later in 2010, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines adopted this cutoff as the ER\u2010positivity standard [8]. However, in the 2020 update guideline, the Expert Panel acknowledged that limited data had shown the benefit of endocrine therapy for tumors with ER 1%\u201010% expression, which were termed \u201cER\u2010low positive breast cancer\u201d [9].\n      Most breast cancers show either strongly ER\u2010positive staining or complete absence of ER staining, making it difficult to study those with ER\u2010low expression [10]. According to a comprehensive meta\u2010analysis including more than 16,000 breast cancer patients, only about 5% fit the ER\u2010low positive category [11]. In general, the prevalence of ER\u2010low positive tumors varied from 3% to 9% [12, 13]. However, due to the extremely high incidence of breast cancer worldwide, this subgroup population still counts a lot and should never be ignored. Unfortunately, due to its low proportion and limited evidence about it, the latest guidelines did not provide detailed descriptions and treatment suggestions for this subgroup population. Herein, we review the most recent innovations in the molecular nature and clinical characteristics of ER\u2010low positive breast cancer, aiming to propose new research aspects and pave the way for future potential diagnostic methods and treatment strategies.\n2\n      DETECTION OF ER\u2010LOW BREAST CANCER\n      \n        2.1\n        LBA testing\n        Regarded as a common biomarker for breast cancer, ER is expressed on the cell membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and nucleus. The way to define ER positivity has long been a controversial issue. Historically, the commonly used ER detection method was LBA, for which a cut point of 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein was generally considered clinically beneficial, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved kits using radiolabeled LBA specified such value. Nevertheless, as some patients with ER levels <10 fmol/mg could also respond to endocrine therapy, 3 fmol/mg was then suggested to be applied as the next cut point [14, 15]. Hence, the responsiveness of patients with ER levels of 4\u20109 fmol/mg to endocrine therapy remained unclear, and possibly due to this, such patients were categorized into the \u201cER\u2010poor\u201d group in a patient\u2010level meta\u2010analysis [16]. Of note, LBA test is nonspecific in accounting for differences in the cellular composition of samples, and so the results will be inaccurate if samples are contaminated by normal/ductal carcinoma in situ tissues [6].\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        IHC testing\n        The development of IHC assay highly paved the way for ER detection. The IHC scoring system has gone through the histochemistry score (H\u2010score) system developed in 1985 [17] and the Allred score system proposed in 1999 [6]. However, what is the optimal cut point for ER positivity by IHC has long been controversial due to the inconsistency between IHC and mRNA testing. Although a previous consensus had been reached that tumors with \u226510% nuclear staining by IHC should be considered ER\u2010positive, there were still reports showing that patients with <10% nuclear staining by IHC could also respond to endocrine therapy. Another cut point of 1% nuclear staining by IHC was based on the concordance analysis with reverse\u2010transcription PCR in E2197 clinical trial [7], and the later 2010 ASCO/CAP guidelines adopted this cut point as ER positivity standard [8]. The proposal on this threshold was retained in the 2020 update of the ASCO/CAP guidelines, but in the updated guidelines, the Expert Panel acknowledged that there was limited data on the benefit of endocrine therapy for patients with ER 1%\u201010% expression by IHC, and suggested that samples with these results should be recorded as \u201cER\u2010low positive\u201d [9]. Figure\u00a01 shows the IHC staining of breast tumors with different ER expression levels.\n        \n          FIGURE 1\n          \n            Immunohistochemistry images of breast tumors with different ER expression levels.

This finding explains the inconsistency between ER expression measurement by IHC and mRNA and some significant under\u2010calling of ER\u2010positive cases [19, 20]. However, it does not explain the similarity observed between ER\u2010low positive tumors and triple\u2010negative breast cancers. Other studies have shown that the loss of ER expression could be caused by a long cold ischemic time of tissues [21, 22]. In a later study, the loss of tissue quality was also found to be associated with loss of ER expression measured by quantitative immunofluorescence [23]. Whether ER\u2010low positive results are a real entity or just the artifact of pathologists needs to be further validated.\n        At present, cumulative evidence strongly suggests that ER\u2010low breast cancer is an existing entity, but it is recommended to repeat IHC testing for ER\u2010low positive cases to ensure its reality [18], although this is not universal and not mandated in the guidelines worldwide.\n2.1\n        LBA testing\n        Regarded as a common biomarker for breast cancer, ER is expressed on the cell membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and nucleus.

We hypothesized that if there is a widespread occurrence of these mechanisms in ER\u2010positive breast tumors, and simultaneously these mechanisms are not dominant, resulting in weak and limited ER expression, then ER\u2010low positive tumors will be observed. The mechanisms already understood mainly include the following, and the underlying biological mechanisms of ER loss are illustrated in Figure\u00a02.\n      \n        FIGURE 2\n        \n          Molecular mechanisms of ER status transition in breast cancer. Molecular mechanisms of ER loss during tumorigenesis basically include genetic changes, epigenetic modulation, post\u2010transcriptional regulation, and growth factor signaling alteration, together resulting in distinct ER expression.

The loss of heterozygosity was found in 19% of cases at the ESR1 locus, which potentially plays a role in tumor proliferation, histological aggressiveness, and down\u2010regulation of ER expression [26]. Another study illustrated that the reduction of ESR1 copy number could also lead to ER downregulation [27, 28].\n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Epigenetic modulation\n        Compared with genetic changes, epigenetic modulations play a more critical role in the loss of ER expression [29]. To date, reported epigenetic regulations related to ER expression loss include ER promoter hypermethylation, histone acetylation, and microRNAs. Methylation of ER gene promoter can induce ER expression loss, while conversely, inhibition of the methylation can reactivate ER expression [30, 31]. As histone 3 is key to epigenetic regulation, the downregulation of ER expression also happens after the acetylation of histone or the inhibition of histone deacetylation [32]. Another regulator of ER expression is microRNAs, which have been reported to regulate the ER expression through direct or indirect ways. For example, miRNA\u2010142\u20103p can downregulate ER expression by directly binding to the 3'\u2010untranslated region of ESR1 mRNA [33], while miRNA\u2010148a can reduce DNMT1 expression in MCF\u20107 cells to upregulate the ER expression indirectly [34].\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Post\u2010transcriptional regulation\n        In addition to genetic changes, ER expression could also be modulated by ubiquitination. HSP90 inhibitors, such as geldanamycin and radicicol, together with some ubiquitin ligases have been shown to downregulate the ER expression by promoting the degradation of ER\u03b1 [35, 36, 37]. Hence, the ubiquitination of ER can be reversed by 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol treatment. Additionally, ER can also be degraded through a proteasome\u2010mediated way by modulating the endogenous ligands levels, alternating the tumor microenvironment, or downregulating the chaperones [38].\n      \n      \n        3.4\n        Growth factor signaling\n        It was found that in the ER\u2010positive MCF\u20107 cells, the upregulation of growth factor signaling could induce hyperactive mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK), hence leading to a reversible loss of ER expression [39]. Similar findings were also observed in a later study that the inhibition of inherent p42/44 MAPK could result in the re\u2010expression of ER. These two studies consistently suggested the critical role of MAPK signaling in the loss of ER expression [40].\n        Although the mechanisms mentioned above can be considered as the potential causes of ER\u2010low positive tumors, the complete mechanism of ER\u2010low expression is still not fully clarified. The reverse\u2010transcription PCR used to detect the expression of molecules may also be contaminated by normal/ductal carcinoma in situ tissues, which may result in inaccurate ER mRNA expression measurement. Additionally, ER mRNA expression is not as important as protein expression, and they do not always correlate [7]. Considering all the above factors, it is still essential to carry out basic research to illustrate this issue further [41, 42].\n3.1\n        Genetic changes\n        Potential mechanisms of ER expression loss include genetic changes, such as ESR1 gene (coding for ER protein) mutation [24] and ESR1 gene loss of heterozygosity [25].

The clinicopathological characteristics of the participants in these studies are summarized in Table\u00a01. In a large retrospective study based on nearly 10,000 patients, significant differences were found between ER\u2010low and ER\u2010high positive groups in age (median age 53 vs. 56 years), clinical TNM stage (stage II/III 62% vs. 44%), the proportion of white ethnicity (66% vs. 72%), ductal carcinoma (84% vs. 73%), grade III disease (82% vs. 28%), and patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy (48% vs. 29%). When compared with the ER\u2010negative group, ER\u2010low positive group only showed significantly different features in the clinical TNM stage (stage II/III 62% vs. 68%) and the proportion of ductal carcinoma (84% vs. 88%) [12]. Generally speaking, it seemed that the difference between ER\u2010low and ER\u2010high positive tumors was relatively larger when compared with the difference between ER\u2010low and ER\u2010negative tumors [13, 43\u201045].\n        \n          TABLE 1\n          \n            Clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer patients with different ER expression levels\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                \n                ER expression level* (%)\n              \n              \n                Characteristic\n                Study\n                Total cases\n                Negative\n                1%\u201010%\n                \u226510%\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Tumor size \u22642cm\n                Deyarmin et\u00a0al., 2012.

The clinicopathological characteristics of the participants in these studies are summarized in Table\u00a01. In a large retrospective study based on nearly 10,000 patients, significant differences were found between ER\u2010low and ER\u2010high positive groups in age (median age 53 vs. 56 years), clinical TNM stage (stage II/III 62% vs. 44%), the proportion of white ethnicity (66% vs. 72%), ductal carcinoma (84% vs. 73%), grade III disease (82% vs. 28%), and patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy (48% vs. 29%). When compared with the ER\u2010negative group, ER\u2010low positive group only showed significantly different features in the clinical TNM stage (stage II/III 62% vs. 68%) and the proportion of ductal carcinoma (84% vs. 88%) [12]. Generally speaking, it seemed that the difference between ER\u2010low and ER\u2010high positive tumors was relatively larger when compared with the difference between ER\u2010low and ER\u2010negative tumors [13, 43\u201045].\n        \n          TABLE 1\n          \n            Clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer patients with different ER expression levels\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                \n                ER expression level* (%)\n              \n              \n                Characteristic\n                Study\n                Total cases\n                Negative\n                1%\u201010%\n                \u226510%\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Tumor size \u22642cm\n                Deyarmin et\u00a0al., 2012.

ER\u2010low positive breast cancer is also a heterogeneous disease and could be further classified (Table\u00a02). In a study aiming to determine the intrinsic subtype of ER\u2010low positive (IHC 1%\u201010%) tumors, 62% and 27% of them were classified as basal\u2010like and HER2\u2010enriched, respectively, which were both considered ER\u2010negative subtypes [47]. Similar results were also found in another study, in which the PAM50 classifier was used to assess the molecular class by ER status. As a result, approximately 50% of the ER\u2010low tumors were found to be basal\u2010like, 30% HER2\u2010enriched, and only 8% luminal\u2010B subtype. In that study, the average ER gene signature scores of ER\u2010negative tumors and ER 1%\u20109% tumors were similar, and both were significantly lower than that of ER \u226510% tumors [48].\n        \n          TABLE 2\n          \n            Distribution of molecular subtypes in ER\u2010low positive breast cancer\n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                Molecular subtypes of breast cancer(cases [%])\n              \n              \n                Study\n                Total cases\n                Luminal\u2010A/B\n                HER2\u2010enriched\n                Basal\u2010like\n                Normal\u2010like\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Iwamoto et\u00a0al., 2012.

The changes in tumor volume were measured by optical projection tomography, which mirrored observations of breast cancer response and histopathological changes to tamoxifen in neoadjuvant trials. In the neoadjuvant trial P024, in which letrozole was compared with tamoxifen in ER/PR\u2010positive invasive breast cancer, a linear association was observed between endocrine therapy response rates and ER expression levels. Marginally ER\u2010positive (Allred score of 3\u20105) tumors were still responsive to letrozole but not to tamoxifen [55, 56]. However, since that study only enrolled patients with ER \u226510% tumors, whether these findings can be extrapolated to ER\u2010low tumors is unknown.\n      \n      \n        6.2\n        Survival outcomes after treatment\n        In a patient\u2010level meta\u2010analysis, the subgroup analysis by the ER expression level showed a moderate benefit from tamoxifen in ER\u2010weakly positive (10\u201019 fmol/mg) breast tumors (risk ratio 0.67 [standard error 0.08]), whose benefit was much lower compared with that in ER\u2010high tumors (\u2265200 fmol/mg; risk ratio = 0.52; standard error = 0.07]) [16]. This meta\u2010analysis was of high evidence level; however, the LBA but not the IHC method used for ER measurement limited its generalizability. In a large retrospective study based on nearly 10000 patients, compared with the ER\u2010low positive group, ER\u2010high positive group was associated with a significantly better outcome both for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7\u20100.9) and disease\u2010free survival (DFS; HR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6\u20100.8), while ER\u2010negative group showed a significantly worse overall survival (HR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1\u20102.0) [12].\n        In contrast, when we compared the ER\u2010low tumors with ER\u2010negative ones, most studies showed no significant difference in terms of recurrence\u2010free survival, DFS, overall survival, and time to recurrence [12, 13, 57]. A potential reason might be that ER expression in this ER\u2010low positive group was quantitatively insufficient to demonstrate a substantial chance for the response to endocrine therapy alone.

In that meta\u2010analysis, patients with ER 1%\u20109% breast cancer who received endocrine therapy seemed to have a prognosis like those without any endocrine therapy (P = 0.68) and those with ER\u2010negative carcinoma who received endocrine therapy (P = 0.15). In contrast, patients with ER\u2010high positive (\u226510%) tumors had better endocrine responsiveness compared with their ER 1%\u20109% counterparts (odds ratio = 0.52; P = 0.03). In conclusion, the borderline ER\u2010positive primary breast cancer might gain no significant survival benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy.\n      \n      \n        6.3\n        Annual recurrence risk\n        It has been reported that the recurrence rate of patients with ER\u2010low positive tumors was high at the first 5 years (1.5%\u20103.5%), and reduced to 1%\u20103% during 5\u201010 years after diagnosis. In contrast, the recurrence rate of patients with ER\u2010high tumors was relatively low in the first 5 years (1.0%\u20102.5%), but in years 5\u201010, the recurrence rate almost doubled (2.5%\u20104.0%) and became higher than that of patients with ER\u2010low positive tumors [58]. The annual recurrence pattern of ER\u2010low cases was similar to triple\u2010negative or ER\u2010negative breast cancers.\n6.1\n        Endocrine therapy sensitivity\n        In preclinical experiments, tamoxifen reduced epithelial cell volume in ER\u2010positive tumors but not in ER\u2010low positive tumors [54].

In that meta\u2010analysis, patients with ER 1%\u20109% breast cancer who received endocrine therapy seemed to have a prognosis like those without any endocrine therapy (P = 0.68) and those with ER\u2010negative carcinoma who received endocrine therapy (P = 0.15). In contrast, patients with ER\u2010high positive (\u226510%) tumors had better endocrine responsiveness compared with their ER 1%\u20109% counterparts (odds ratio = 0.52; P = 0.03). In conclusion, the borderline ER\u2010positive primary breast cancer might gain no significant survival benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy.\n6.3\n        Annual recurrence risk\n        It has been reported that the recurrence rate of patients with ER\u2010low positive tumors was high at the first 5 years (1.5%\u20103.5%), and reduced to 1%\u20103% during 5\u201010 years after diagnosis. In contrast, the recurrence rate of patients with ER\u2010high tumors was relatively low in the first 5 years (1.0%\u20102.5%), but in years 5\u201010, the recurrence rate almost doubled (2.5%\u20104.0%) and became higher than that of patients with ER\u2010low positive tumors [58]. The annual recurrence pattern of ER\u2010low cases was similar to triple\u2010negative or ER\u2010negative breast cancers.\n7\n      TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR ER\u2010LOW BREAST CANCER\n      \n        7.1\n        Assessment by multi\u2010gene assays\n        How to make clinical decisions for patients with ER\u2010low expression needs to be further studied. A series of breast cancer genetic tools, such as the 21\u2010gene recurrence score and PAM50 risk of recurrence score, were suggested to be used to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with ER/PR\u2010positive, HER2\u2010negative (node\u2010negative) breast cancers [59]. The 21\u2010gene Oncotype DX and 70\u2010gene MammaPrint assays have also been shown to distinguish breast cancers that are likely to metastasis and help predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy [60, 61]. Therefore, one of the future research directions is to study how to use these genetic tools for assessing reoccurrence risk and selecting molecular subtypes that can benefit from corresponding therapies.\n      \n      \n        7.2\n        Intensity of ER staining\n        In a case\u2010cohort study including more than 4000 ER\u2010positive breast cancer cases, those with ER intensity of 2 or 3 were found to have a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer mortality compared to those with ER intensity of 1 [62]. This finding encourages further research to explore the specific relationship between ER staining intensity and response or outcome, which may help to develop a better treatment strategy for patients with ER\u2010low positive breast cancer.\n      \n      \n        7.3\n        Concurrent chemotherapy with endocrine therapy\n        In the aspect of molecular essence and therapeutic response, just as discussed above, ER\u2010low positive tumors seem to be more similar to ER\u2010negative tumors rather than ER\u2010high positive tumors. Therefore, we suggest that the exemption of chemotherapy for patients with ER\u2010low expression should be cautious. In recent years, there is growing evidence that supports the benefits of chemotherapy itself in postoperative patients with ER\u2010positive tumors. In the POTENT trial, compared to endocrine therapy alone, the postoperative use of an oral fluoropyrimidine S\u20101 could significantly improve the invasive DFS of patients with ER\u2010positive and HER2\u2010negative breast cancer [63]. The CREATE\u2010X trial also reported a similar finding that compared with the control group, there was a tendency for the postoperative adjuvant use of capecitabine to improve the DFS of ER\u2010positive and HER2\u2010negative breast cancer patients [64]. These findings further suggested the possibility of applying chemotherapy in patients with ER\u2010low breast tumors. In another trial that enrolled patients with ER/PR <10% early breast cancer, no significant reduction in DFS events was achieved by cyclophosphamide and methotrexate maintenance for patients with ER/PR <10% breast tumors, however, the trend toward benefit in the node\u2010positive subgroup supported the further exploration of this strategy in the ER\u2010low, higher\u2010risk population [65].\n      \n      \n        7.4\n        De\u2010escalating or escalating endocrine therapy?\n        Further optimization of current endocrine therapy for patients with ER\u2010low expression is also needed. Taking the recurrence risk and time to recurrence into consideration, we believe that clinical trials or real\u2010world studies on the necessity of 5\u2010year endocrine therapy should be conducted to explore whether a shorter time (e.g., 2\u20103 years) of endocrine therapy is enough. In the chemoprevention field, the randomized TAM\u201001 trial had demonstrated that low\u2010dose and short\u2010term (3\u2010year) tamoxifen could halve the recurrence rate of breast intraepithelial neoplasia with limited toxicity, providing a new treatment option for these disorders [66].\n        Which endocrine therapy regimen is more suitable for this population should also be further studied. The ATAC trial reported a significant improvement in survival with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen [67]. In subgroup analysis, a more pronounced improvement in survival associated with anastrozole was observed in the ER\u2010positive/PR\u2010negative group compared with ER\u2010positive/PR\u2010positive group. Adequate PR expression is an essential part of the activated ER pathway [68], while the lack of PR expression may define a subgroup with impaired ER pathway. Because of this, the observed advantage of anastrozole in the ER\u2010positive/PR\u2010negative subgroup may also be the case in patients with ER\u2010low expression.\n      \n      \n        7.5\n        Ovarian function suppression (OFS)\n        For premenopausal women with hormone receptor\u2010positive breast cancer, tamoxifen for at least five years is a standard of care, and adjuvant OFS may also be recommended under certain circumstances [69]. The TEXT and SOFT trials have demonstrated a better outcome associated with exemestane plus OFS than tamoxifen with or without OFS, mainly in patients with higher recurrence risk, as defined by clinicopathologic characteristics and whether receiving chemotherapy [69, 70]. The data of OFS treatment in ER\u2010low patients, however, are lacking. Per the SOFT and TEXT trial protocol, the tumors should express ER/PR at least 10% of the cells. In the enrolled population, 95% of patients have more than 50% highly\u2010expressed ER [71]. These facts did not support OFS in premenopausal ER\u2010low patients, and further research is needed.\n7.1\n        Assessment by multi\u2010gene assays\n        How to make clinical decisions for patients with ER\u2010low expression needs to be further studied.

Currently, the benefit of novel therapies either alone or in combination with standard endocrine therapy for patients with ER\u2010low positive breast cancer was still under investigation in several clinical trials, some of which have achieved favorable results (Table\u00a04). We believe these trials will pave the way for the future treatment options for ER\u2010low positive breast cancer.\n      \n        TABLE 4\n        \n          Ongoing trials in ER\u2010low positive breast cancer\n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              Drug\n              NCT identifier\n              Study title\n              Phase\n              Requirement for ER expression\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Afatinib\n              NCT02115048\n              Clinical Study for the Treatment of Breast Cancer: the Patient Will Receive Afatinib Plus Letrozole or Letrozole Alone\n              II\n              First\u2010line treatment for ER\u2010low positive breast cancer (H\u2010score of 1\u2010159)\n            \n            \n              AZD6244\n              NCT01313039\n              Evaluation of the Use of AZD6244 to Induce Increased ER Expression and Anti\u2010Estrogen Response in ER\u2010Negative/Low Breast Cancer\n              I\n              Pretreated breast cancer with ER \u226410% expression by IHC\n            \n            \n              Olaparib and Durvalumab\n              NCT03594396\n              Window of Opportunity Trial of Neoadjuvant Olaparib and Durvalumab for Triple Negative or Low ER\u2010positive Breast Cancer\n              I/II\n              Pretreated breast cancer with ER \u226410% expression by IHC\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Abbreviations: ER, estrogen receptor; IHC, immunohistochemistry.\n          \n        \n        \n          John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n        \n      \n      \n        8.1\n        Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor\n        Given that the activated MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling and crosstalk between ER and growth factor pathways are the potential mechanisms of ER downregulation, blocking the growth factor pathway to treat ER\u2010low breast cancer deserves investigation. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT02115048) is underway to assess the effect of the addition of afatinib, a highly selective, irreversible inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR [72], to the conventional endocrine therapy in patients with ER\u2010low positive by H\u2010score measurement.\n      \n      \n        8.2\n        Poly ADP\u2010ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors\n        To a large extent, ER\u2010low tumors are comparable to ER\u2010negative tumors, which probably have homologous recombination repair deficiency and genome instability. Gene expression signatures define a BRCAness subgroup of early ER\u2010positive breast cancer. PARP inhibition can result in preferential death of cancer cells when BRCA1/2\u2010based repairing DNA is defective [73]. A trial of neoadjuvant olaparib and durvalumab for ER\u2010low breast cancer is undergoing (NCT03594396).\n      \n      \n        8.3\n        Cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors with endocrine therapy\n        For patients with hormone receptor\u2010positive, HER2\u2010negative metastatic breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitor has become standard care as the first\u2010line setting [74]. In the adjuvant setting, in the phase III MonarchE trial, which included patients with hormone receptor\u2010positive, HER2\u2010negative, high\u2010risk early breast cancer, abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy was associated with a significant improvement in invasive DFS, with aN HR of 0.75 (95% CI = 0.60\u20100.93) compared with the endocrine therapy group [75]. The subgroup analysis showed that abemaciclib had high efficacy in patients with PR\u2010low and grade III tumors, which might represent impaired ER\u2010pathway as ER\u2010low cases.\n        In contrast, in another similarly designed phase III PALLAS trial evaluating the efficacy of palbociclib plus endocrine therapy, no significant improvement in invasive DFS was observed [76]. Besides, the phase III PENELOPE\u2010B trial (NCT01864746), which compares 1\u2010year palbociclib with endocrine therapy to placebo with endocrine treatment, failed to meet the primary endpoint for patients having residual invasive disease after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Such a discrepancy put the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in early breast cancer into debate. Potential explanations include the difference in recruited population and the potential difference in effectiveness between abemaciclib and palbociclib.\n        Several ongoing clinical trials, including the POLAR study (NCT03820830), which aims to test the efficacy of 3\u2010year palbociclib in combination with standard endocrine therapy, and the NATALEE trial (NCT03701334), which seeks to evaluate another CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, will provide us further data to shed light on the exact role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in hormone receptor\u2010positive and HER2\u2010negative early breast cancer. Before that time, the application of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with ER\u2010low positive tumors should be cautious.\n      \n      \n        8.4\n        Immunotherapy\n        Given that accumulating data support that the immune system plays a crucial role in breast cancer, and gene expression signatures of tumor inflammation define subgroups of early ER\u2010positive breast cancer [77], immunotherapy deserves to be explored in subgroups of ER\u2010positive patients. There is evidence that PD\u20101/PD\u2010L1 signaling antagonists may have meaningful clinical activity in some patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancers [78]. Given these findings, we should actively try the application of immunotherapy in patients with ER\u2010low expression.\n      \n      \n        8.5\n        ER expression rescue treatment\n        Considering the relatively good prognosis of patients with ER\u2010high positive tumors, we think that another fascinating perspective is to transform ER\u2010low/negative cancers to ER\u2010high positive cancers by increasing ER expression to increase their responsiveness to endocrine therapy. One clinical trial that tried to apply this strategy by using AZD6244 (NCT01313039) is currently underway.\n8.1\n        Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor\n        Given that the activated MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling and crosstalk between ER and growth factor pathways are the potential mechanisms of ER downregulation, blocking the growth factor pathway to treat ER\u2010low breast cancer deserves investigation. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT02115048) is underway to assess the effect of the addition of afatinib, a highly selective, irreversible inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR [72], to the conventional endocrine therapy in patients with ER\u2010low positive by H\u2010score measurement.\n8.2\n        Poly ADP\u2010ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors\n        To a large extent, ER\u2010low tumors are comparable to ER\u2010negative tumors, which probably have homologous recombination repair deficiency and genome instability. Gene expression signatures define a BRCAness subgroup of early ER\u2010positive breast cancer. PARP inhibition can result in preferential death of cancer cells when BRCA1/2\u2010based repairing DNA is defective [73]. A trial of neoadjuvant olaparib and durvalumab for ER\u2010low breast cancer is undergoing (NCT03594396).\n8.3\n        Cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors with endocrine therapy\n        For patients with hormone receptor\u2010positive, HER2\u2010negative metastatic breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitor has become standard care as the first\u2010line setting [74]. In the adjuvant setting, in the phase III MonarchE trial, which included patients with hormone receptor\u2010positive, HER2\u2010negative, high\u2010risk early breast cancer, abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy was associated with a significant improvement in invasive DFS, with aN HR of 0.75 (95% CI = 0.60\u20100.93) compared with the endocrine therapy group [75]. The subgroup analysis showed that abemaciclib had high efficacy in patients with PR\u2010low and grade III tumors, which might represent impaired ER\u2010pathway as ER\u2010low cases.\n        In contrast, in another similarly designed phase III PALLAS trial evaluating the efficacy of palbociclib plus endocrine therapy, no significant improvement in invasive DFS was observed [76]. Besides, the phase III PENELOPE\u2010B trial (NCT01864746), which compares 1\u2010year palbociclib with endocrine therapy to placebo with endocrine treatment, failed to meet the primary endpoint for patients having residual invasive disease after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Such a discrepancy put the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in early breast cancer into debate. Potential explanations include the difference in recruited population and the potential difference in effectiveness between abemaciclib and palbociclib.\n        Several ongoing clinical trials, including the POLAR study (NCT03820830), which aims to test the efficacy of 3\u2010year palbociclib in combination with standard endocrine therapy, and the NATALEE trial (NCT03701334), which seeks to evaluate another CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, will provide us further data to shed light on the exact role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in hormone receptor\u2010positive and HER2\u2010negative early breast cancer. Before that time, the application of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with ER\u2010low positive tumors should be cautious.\n8.4\n        Immunotherapy\n        Given that accumulating data support that the immune system plays a crucial role in breast cancer, and gene expression signatures of tumor inflammation define subgroups of early ER\u2010positive breast cancer [77], immunotherapy deserves to be explored in subgroups of ER\u2010positive patients. There is evidence that PD\u20101/PD\u2010L1 signaling antagonists may have meaningful clinical activity in some patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancers [78]. Given these findings, we should actively try the application of immunotherapy in patients with ER\u2010low expression.\n8.5\n        ER expression rescue treatment\n        Considering the relatively good prognosis of patients with ER\u2010high positive tumors, we think that another fascinating perspective is to transform ER\u2010low/negative cancers to ER\u2010high positive cancers by increasing ER expression to increase their responsiveness to endocrine therapy. One clinical trial that tried to apply this strategy by using AZD6244 (NCT01313039) is currently underway.\n9\n      CLINICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR ER\u2010LOW (1%\u201010%) BREAST CANCER\n      \nER values between 1% and 10% were considered equivocal. ER 1%\u201010% breast cancer is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease not fully recapitulated by ER status. Molecular profiling of this subset might provide more information for intrinsic molecular subtypes and endocrine sensitivity [79].Although low ER expression has a less favorable prognosis and less benefit from endocrine therapy than tumors with higher ER expression levels, there was a consensus that endocrine therapy is recommended for patients with ER \u22651% positive tumor nuclei.Patients with ER\u2010low positive breast cancer who have a clinically node\u2010positive disease and/or an indication of adjuvant chemotherapy should be offered an adequate chemotherapy such as anthracycline\u2010 and taxane\u2010containing regimen. For intermediate\u2010to\u2010low risk patients or those with cardiac risk factors, taxane\u2010based regimens, such as docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel plus carboplatin, may be recommended instead [80, 81].Since endocrine therapy alone cannot be relied upon for patients with ER 1%\u201010% breast cancer, alternative treatment options might induce a better survival. During endocrine therapy, other treatments, such as oral fluoropyrimidine S\u20101, have been demonstrated to be beneficial for the survival of early\u2010stage breast cancer patients [63].Whether OFS on the base of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor would offer more survival benefits is still unclear since patients with ER 1%\u201010% breast cancer were not enrolled in the SOFT and TEXT trial [69, 70]. The application of CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib in ER\u2010low patients seems to be promising, since ER 1\u201010% cases were enrolled in the MonarchE trial and the subgroup analyses showed consistent results with the main findings [75].There is a tendency to de\u2010escalate the treatment for ER\u2010low positive breast cancer patients. Such de\u2010escalation includes the shortened period of adjuvant 5\u2010year endocrine therapy, the decreased need for endocrine therapy extension after 5\u2010year treatment, and the reduced necessity of chemoprevention with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.\n10\n      CONCLUSIONS\n      It seems that ER\u2010low positive (1%\u201010%) breast cancer is mainly similar to ER\u2010negative breast cancer in terms of molecular essence, clinicopathological characteristics, therapeutic response, and prognosis. Despite this, at least a certain proportion of ER\u2010low cases may have an activated ER\u2010pathway nature. Such complexity makes it critical to use molecular and genetic tools to accurately dissect ER\u2010low positive tumors' molecular nature. Caution should therefore be applied when treating patients with this disease. Considering the lack of standard guidelines and urgent needs, we need future research including developing novel biomarkers for risk assessment, optimization for current endocrine therapy, exploration of potential benefits of chemotherapy, and potential use of immunotherapy for these patients. Simultaneously, further large\u2010scale studies will be necessary to explore the essential characteristics and treatment sensitivity of ER\u2010low positive tumors.\nDECLARATIONS\nETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE\n      Not applicable.\nCONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\n      Not applicable.\nAVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIALS\n      Not applicable.\nCOMPETING INTERESTS\n      The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAUTHORS' CONTRIBUTIONS\n      All authors wrote, read, and approved the final manuscript.",
