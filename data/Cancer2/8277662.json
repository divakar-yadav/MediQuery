    "description": "Background:\n          The activation of insulin pathways is hypothesized to promote tumor growth and worsen breast cancer survival. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can lead to higher risk of insulin resistance and may affect survival. The authors prospectively evaluated the relation of post-diagnostic SSB and artificially sweetened beverage (ASB) consumption with mortality among women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\n          In total, 8,863 women with stage I through III breast cancer were identified during follow-up of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS; 1980\u20132010) and Nurses\u2019 Health Study II (NHSII; 1991\u20132011). Women completed a validated food frequency questionnaire every four years after diagnosis and were followed until death or end of follow-up (2014 for the NHS and 2015 for the NHSII). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, after adjusting for measures of adiposity and other potential predictors of cancer survival.\nResults:\n          With a median follow-up of 11.5 years, 2,482 deaths were prospectively documented, including 1,050 deaths from breast cancer. Compared with women who had no consumption, women who had SSB consumption after diagnosis had higher breast cancer-specific (>1 to 3 servings/week, HR=1.31; 95%CI=1.09\u20131.58; >3 servings/week, HR=1.35; 95%CI=1.12\u20131.62; Ptrend=0.001) and all-cause (>1 to 3 servings/week, HR=1.21; 95%CI=1.07\u20131.37; >3 servings/week, HR=1.28; 95%CI=1.13\u20131.45; Ptrend=0.0001) mortality. In contrast, ASB consumption was not associated with higher breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality. Furthermore, replacing one serving/day of SSB consumption with one serving/day of ASB consumption was not associated with lower risk of mortality.\nConclusions:\n          Higher post-diagnostic SSB consumption among breast cancer survivors was associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality and death from all causes.",
