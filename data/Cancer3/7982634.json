    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Malignant tumors are a major public problem that seriously threatens human health. Lung cancer has the highest fatality rate, which has caused it to be the leading cause of cancer\u2010related death.\n1\n It has been estimated that 2.1\u00a0million new lung cancer cases and 1.8\u00a0million deaths were reported worldwide in 2018, equivalent to 18.4% of all cancer\u2010related deaths.\n2\n Lung cancer can be divided into two main types: non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases\n3\n and has been further categorized into three subgroups based on its histology: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.\n4\n\n\n      Modes of treatment available for lung cancer include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgery and radiotherapy are usually used to treat early\u2010stage lung cancer patients, but these treatment modes are associated with a high risk of cancer recurrence.\n5\n At present, the most used chemotherapeutic drugs are carboplatin and paclitaxel. However, severe adverse reactions and drug resistance are still the main obstacles for successful treatment when using these drugs.\n6\n The discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has promoted the development of targeted molecular therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). It has widely reshaped the cancer treatment paradigm of NSCLC. However, in most cases, these types of therapies have been found to eventually develop resistance to first and second generation TKI.\n7\n Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can significantly impact clinical outcomes in several types of solid tumors, including NSCLC. Still, several clinical and biological barriers need to be overcome, and associated predictive markers need to be identified.\n8\n Despite the development of alternative interventions, the results of their use have been unsatisfactory, with the prognosis being poor and the combined five\u2010year survival rate for all stages reaching only about 16%.\n2\n Therefore, it is necessary to identify more effective methods of treatment that present fewer disadvantages.\n      Natural substances have been extensively used for the prevention and treatment of various diseases since ancient times. Paclitaxel, which is currently used for cancer treatment, is derived from plants and is used as an antimicrotubular drug that enhances the role of the tubulin dimer and stabilizes microtubules, while inhibiting its disassembly from promoting microtubule assembly and inhibiting cell replication.\n9\n The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use in combination with cisplatin for patients with AIDS\u2010related Kaposi's sarcoma, ovarian and breast cancer, and patients who cannot undergo surgery with/without radiotherapy for NSCLC. It has also been clinically used to treat recurrent or refractory SCLC.\n10\n This has triggered an upsurge in the study of plant\u2010derived compounds. Along with exploring a variety of organisms and applying new technologies, potential bioactive compounds extracted from natural products have received an increased amount of attention regarding their use in cancer treatment. Some of these compounds, such as ginsenoside Rg3 and topotecan (a derivative of camptothecin), have already been used in a clinical setting, while others, such as luteic acid and silybin, are still undergoing clinical trials. These compounds have been found to exert many anticancer activities on lung cancer cells, and these anticancer effects involve autophagy, apoptosis, and a variety of signal pathways.\n      Hundreds of natural products have been proven to inhibit the development of tumors. The complications that arise from the use of these natural products have limited their large\u2010scale clinical application, while the advancement of nanotechnology and other emerging technologies have increased their potential effectiveness. This study summarizes the mechanisms, prospects, and challenges for the clinical application of natural products and their derivatives to treat lung cancer.\n2\n      ANTINEOPLASTIC DRUGS CLASSIFIED BY SOURCE\n      \n        2.1\n        Plants\n        \n          2.1.1\n          Ginsenosides\n          Ginsenosides are frequently used in East Asia and North America. Ginsenosides, the main components extracted from ginseng, exert various bioactivities, such as anti\u2010tumor, immunomodulatory, antioxidant produce, and anti\u2010inflammation effects.\n11\n Ginsenosides mainly exert their anticancer effects on lung, breast, liver, and colorectal cancers. Ginsenoside Rg3, Rh2, and compound K are the main bioactive compounds in ginsenosides that produce anticancer effects.\n12\n Among them, ginsenoside Rg3\u00a0has been approved as an anticancer drug by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2000 and was listed as a designated drug for the treatment of NSCLC in the Clinical Practice Guide of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (Chinese version) in 2006 and 2007.\n13\n Protopanaxadiol (PPT) and Propanaxadiol (PPD), two metabolites of ginsenosides, have also shown activity against a variety of cancer cells while PPT is more effective in inhibiting the viability and invasiveness of lung cancer cells, especially lung squamous cells.\n11\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.2\n          Camptothecin (CPT)\n          Camptothecin (CPT) was the first natural compound derived from Camptotheca acuminata. It is a quinoline alkaloid that was first synthesized by Wall and Wani in 1966.\n14\n Topotecan, a derivative of camptothecin, has been used as a first\u2010line and second\u2010line chemotherapeutic drug for SCLC. In the European Union and the United States, it is considered as the only drug suitable for use as a second\u2010line chemotherapeutic drug for recurrent SCLC. Irinotecan in combination with cisplatin has been used for the treatment of SCLC.\n15\n Recently published in vitro and in vivo studies on CPT and its derivatives, such as irinotecan (CPT\u201011, 4), Belotecan (CKD\u2010602, 5), and 10\u2010hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), have reported that they exert a wide range of anti\u2010tumor activities on multiple types of tumors, including ovarian cancer, NSCLC, and refractory colorectal cancer.\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n Belo is a relatively new camptothecin derivative approved in Korea for the treatment of NSCLC and ovarian cancers. Compared with older camptothecin preparations, belotecan has been reported to show a similar effective level and a decreased toxic level.\n19\n Several other camptothecin analogs, including 7\u2010(4\u2010methylpiperazinomethylene)\u201010, 9\u2010aminocamptothecin, exatecan mesylate, 11\u2010ethylenedioxy\u201020(S)\u2010camptothecin, 9\u2010nitrocamptothecin, and karenitecin, are also at various stages of clinical development.\n20\n However, the side effects of their use include diarrhea, fatigue, myelosuppression, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hair loss, and peripheral neuropathy.\n21\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.3\n          Curcumin (CUR)\n          Turmeric is a spice originally found in India used in curries and as a natural colorant. It contains three bioactive polyphenols: curcumin (CUR), demethoxycurcumin (DMC), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BMC).\n22\n In a paper published in 1949 in the Journal Nature, Schraufstatter and his colleagues reported that curcumin is a bioactive compound with antibacterial properties that are active against a variety of bacterial strains.\n23\n Curcumin is also known to exert antioxidant and anticancer effects and is important for the treatment or prevention of various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\n24\n Its anticancer activity was confirmed in 1980 by Kuttan and his colleagues using in vitro and in vivo models.\n23\n Zhang et al. first proved that curcumin exerts anticancer effects using human lung adenocarcinoma cells with multidrug resistance to A549/DDP.\n25\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.4\n          \u03b2\u2010elemene (\u03b2\u2010ELE)\n          \u03b2\u2010elemene is a natural sesquiterpene extracted from turmeric, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and is a non\u2010cytotoxic II antineoplastic drug.\n26\n \u03b2\u2010elemene has been approved to treat many types of cancers, including brain, breast, prostate, ovarian, and lung cancer, with no severe side effects being reported. It can inhibit the migration, invasion, proliferation and enhance the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells.\n27\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.5\n          Gambogic (GA)\n          GA is a natural product extracted from Han's Geng Huang resin. Since ancient times, it has been used as a detoxification, anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010parasitic drug in China and Southeast Asia.\n28\n The use of GA, which has the molecular formula C38H44O9 (628.34\u00a0g/mol),\n29\n is advantageous since it produces low levels of toxicity, resistance to many cell lines and multiple mechanisms, and is a potential anti\u2010tumor compound. The National Medical Products Administration has approved GA for use in treating advanced lung, liver, stomach, breast and colon cancers after the successful conclusion of clinical trials.\n30\n The CFDA has also approved it for clinical trials for the therapy of various other types of cancers.\n31\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.6\n          Tanshinone\n          \nSalvia miltiorrhiza has high medicinal value in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and can be used to treat a variety of cardio\u2010cerebrovascular diseases, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and acute ischemic stroke.\n32\n Recent studies have shown that Salvia miltiorrhiza is an effective inhibitor of platelet agglutination. Additionally, clinical trials have shown that Salvia miltiorrhiza is also effective for treating and preventing Alzheimer's disease.\n33\n Nakao et al. isolated tanshinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza for the first time since the 1930s, and since then, more than 90 derived chemical constituents have been identified. These compounds can be divided into compounds with over 40 lipophilic components and compounds with over 50 hydrophilic compounds.\n34\n Among them, the proportion of tanshinone IIA (TSA, Tan IIA) is the highest. Accumulated evidence has shown that tanshinone IIA exerts a broad\u2010spectrum of anti\u2010tumor properties against various malignant human tumors.\n32\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.7\n          Licorice chalcone (LIC)\n          Licorice is a traditional Chinese medicinal drug widely used in clinical settings. Its main function involves the regulation of temperature, moisturization of the lungs, alleviation of toxicity, and coordination of the properties of drugs.\n35\n It is used to treat gastritis, ulceration, coughs, bronchitis, and inflammation.\n36\n In addition to triterpenes, about 300 polyphenols, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, flavanes, chalcones, and isoflavones, with a concentration of 1%\u20135% each, have been isolated from licorice root and licorice extract.\n37\n Among them, licorice chalcone A (LICA), Licochalcone B (LCB), and Licochalcone D (LCD) have been proven to provide a variety of health benefits, including anticancer effects.\n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.8\n          Triptolide (TPL)\n          The root extract of Tripterygium wilfordii has been used to treat various diseases throughout history. TPL was first isolated from the Chinese herbal medicine Tripterygium wilfordii in 1972\n42\n and is a diterpene lactone compound that contains three epoxy groups and is the main active component of Tripterygium wilfordii. Therefore, the discovery of TPL has paved the way for further anti\u2010tumor studies on triptolide.\n43\n TPL can inhibit cancer cell growth and exhibit preclinical anti\u2010tumor activity on many types of cancers, including neuroblastoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple gastrointestinal cancers (e.g., cancers of the stomach, liver, colon, and pancreas).\n42\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.9\n          Emodin (ED)\n          Emodin is a natural active anthraquinone compound extracted from the rhubarb rhizome.\n44\n Pharmacological studies have shown that emodin exerts a wide variety of activity, including anti\u2010inflammation and anti\u2010tumor effects, and prevents the development of many health issues, such as lung injury, pancreatitis, intestinal mucosal injury, and ulcerative colitis.\n45\n Previous studies have shown that emodin exerts its antiproliferative effects on various cancer cells, including lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n46\n Emodin can inhibit the growth and apoptosis of A549 cells through its action on the external apoptosis pathway and the induction of cell cycle arrest.\n47\n\n\n          \n            Berberine (BBR)\n            \nCoptis chinensis is a traditional Chinese medicinal drug of high value that is commonly used in China. Berberine is the primary bioactive component of Coptis chinensis, accounting for 5.20%\u20137.69% of all compounds.\n48\n It exerts various pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti\u2010microbial, liver protection, anti\u2010inflammatory, anti\u2010tumor, neuroprotection, blood lipid, and hypoglycemic effects.\n49\n Recent studies have indicated that BBR exerts its anticancer effects on several high\u2010risk cancers, including lung, prostate, colorectal, breast, and gastric cancer.\n50\n Additionally, other in vitro studies on tumor cell lines have shown that BBR inhibits cancer cell proliferation and migration and induces the apoptosis of a variety of cancer cell lines.\n51\n\n\n          \n        \n        \n          2.1.10\n          Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)\n          Green tea is a popular non\u2010alcoholic drink in Asian countries, and its long\u2010term consumption has been found to provide many health benefits. A 10\u2010year prospective cohort study conducted in Japan found that drinking 10 cups of green tea (120\u00a0ml/cup) a day delayed cancer onset.\n52\n Catechin is the main active ingredient in green tea. The main catechins are (\u2010)\u2010epicatechin gallate (ECG), (\u2010)\u2010epicatechin (EC), (\u2010)\u2010epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin, and (\u2010)\u2010epigallocatechin\u20103\u2010gallate (EGCG).\n53\n EGCG is the main catechin found in green tea and accounts for 50\u2010\u201080% of the total quantity of catechins. EGCG exerts antioxidant activity and affects a variety of human diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, stroke and obesity.\n54\n Animal and cell line studies have shown that EGCG plays a crucial role in promoting apoptosis and reducing cancer growth, and is potential chemoprophylaxis and therapeutic compound for skin cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers.\n55\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.11\n          Resveratrol (RSV)\n          Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is commonly found in red wine, peanuts, and grapes. It has been found to exert numerous biological properties, including antioxidant, antifungal, neuroprotective, anti\u2010inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer properties.\n56\n The most well\u2010known property of RSV is its antioxidation property, which can convert free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), into inactive compounds.\n57\n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies conducted on resveratrol have found that hat it can be used for the therapy of a wide variety of human cancers, including lung, skin, breast, blood, cervical, and bone cancers, as well as gastrointestinal tumors.\n58\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.12\n          Artemisinin\n          In 1972, a team led by Tu Youyou first isolated artemisinin through a plant screening research program called Project 523, which aimed to identify suitable antimalarial treatment drugs. In 2015, the discovery of artemisinin earned China its first Nobel Prize winner.\n59\n It has been reported that artemisinin\u2010based drugs, such as dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artemisinin, and artesunate, are highly effective active antimalarial drugs that also exert effective anticancer activities against hematological tumors and somatic tumors, and selective cytotoxicity toward malignant cells.\n60\n Therefore, they have become research hotspots. Studies have found that artemisinin exerts a variety of pharmacological effects against inflammation, viral infection, and cell and tumor proliferation, and has been shown to have a relatively safe toxicity profile, indicating the ability of artemisinin to decrease inflammation, invasion and metastasis, proliferation, and induce apoptosis.\n61\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.13\n          Silybin\n          Silybin (C25H22O10), the main bioactive ingredient of silymarin, is a compound isolated from the fruits and seeds of silymarin. It has a long history of human use and does not exert apparent toxicity in animals and humans even after a long period of usage. It is commonly used as a nutritional and healthy food in Europe, Asia, and the United States.\n62\n The antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of silybin have led to its use to treat acute and chronic liver diseases caused by drugs, toxins, hepatitis, and alcohol, as well as gallbladder diseases.\n63\n Preclinical studies have shown that silybin can strongly inhibit the invasion and migration of cancer cells.\n64\n Its anti\u2010tumor activity has been demonstrated in animal models of cancers of the liver, lung, skin, prostate, and colon.\n65\n Phase \u2160/\u2161 clinical trials of prostate cancer are currently being conducted, and phase \u2160 studies have reported it to be non\u2010toxic.\n66\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.14\n          Cinnamon\n          Cinnamon is a spice and traditional herbal medicine used for hundreds of years that has been shown to exert antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties.\n67\n Available evidence has shown that cinnamon exerts anti\u2010tumor, anti\u2010inflammatory, anti\u2010microbial, cholesterol\u2010lowering, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects. It can also act as an insulin mimic that can enhance insulin activity or stimulate cell glucose metabolism \n68\n and affect apoptosis.\n69\n The cinnamon extract contains several active ingredients, such as essential oils (cinnamaldehyde), tannin, caryophyllene, cinnamyl acetate, linalool, and eugenol.\n70\n, \n71\n Whole cinnamon and its active components have been reported to exert significant anti\u2010tumor activity in different types of cancer.\n72\n\n\n        \n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Animals\n        \n          2.2.1\n          Astaxanthin (ATX)\n          Astaxanthin (ATX) is a ketone carotene widely found in shrimp, salmon, crab, red yeast, and other marine animals.\n73\n It exerts strong antioxidant activity, anti\u2010tumor effects, anti\u2010inflammatory effects, and hepatoprotective effects.\n74\n In 1987, ATX was approved by the USFDA as a feed additive for aquaculture and was subsequently approved as a dietary supplement in 1999.\n75\n In addition, numerous evidence has shown that ATX exerts anticancer effects on many types of cancers, including lung cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.\n73\n, \n76\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.2.2\n          Melittin\n          Bee venom is a complex mixture of bioactive substances that can be injected into specific parts of the body during bee venom therapy. In recent years, bee venom has been used to treat many diseases, such as cancer, chronic pain, arthritis and atopic dermatitis.\n77\n Melittin is the main component of the venom and is an amphiphilic peptide with 26 amino acid residues.\n78\n It exerts radiation protective, anti\u2010mutagenicity, and anti\u2010inflammation and analgesic activities.\n79\n In addition, previous studies have already proven that melittin can induce cell cycle arrest, growth inhibition, and apoptosis of a variety of cancer cells, and has become an ideal anticancer candidate due to its broad\u2010spectrum of lytic properties.\n80\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.2.3\n          Snake venom\n          Although snakebite poisoning is a public health problem that can endanger human lives, snake venom is considered a potential source of bioactive compounds. Snake wine or snake venom wine is used in conventional Chinese medicine.\n81\n Snake venom is primarily a complex mixture of proteins with enzyme activity, with the proteins and peptides accounting for about 90% of the dry weight of the venom.\n82\n These enzymes include metalloproteinase (MP), L\u2010amino acid oxidase (LAAOs), integrin, C lectin, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2\u00a0s).\n83\n Their mechanisms of action include direct toxicity (PLA2\u00a0s), induction of cell apoptosis (PLA2\u00a0s, LAAOs, and MP), free radical production (LAAOs), and anti\u2010angiogenesis activity (double integrin and lectin). These compounds exert higher levels of cytotoxicity and cell inhibitory activity on tumor cells than that exerted on normal cells, which indicates the potential clinical application of snake venom.\n84\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.2.4\n          Scorpion venom\n          Scorpions are among the most primitive arthropods of the animal kingdom that have existed on the earth for more than 400 million years and are globally distributed. Since ancient times, scorpion venom has been used in traditional medicinal applications of different countries, especially in China, India, Cuba, Africa, and Spain.\n85\n Scorpion venom is a complicated mixture of proteins (peptides and enzymes) and non\u2010proteins (nucleotides, lipids, free amino acids, inorganic salts, and water).\n86\n The most important components of scorpion venom are disulfide bridging peptides (DBPs/DBs) and non\u2010disulfide bridging peptides (NDBPs/NDBs), which exert a variety of pharmacological activities and have been used for the therapy of many diseases, including cancer.\n87\n Their specific interactions with ion channels may be the main mechanism by which the anticancer activity of scorpion venom is exerted.\n88\n\n\n        \n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Microorganisms\n        \n          2.3.1\n          Doxorubicin (Dox)\n          Doxorubicin, an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces peucetius bacteria, is an anthracycline chemotherapeutic drug. Since the 1960\u00a0s, it has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent.\n89\n It was approved for use in the US in 1974 and is still an important drug used in many cancer chemotherapy programs.\n21\n It is commonly used for the treatment of lung cancer, gastric cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, thyroid cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n90\n However, its use produces serious side effects, with the most prominent being cardiotoxicity that can lead to left ventricular insufficiency, dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart failure, and the severity of heart disease is related to the accumulated dose of Dox administered during anticancer treatment.\n91\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.3.2\n          Staurosporine (STS)\n          Staurosporine was first isolated from Streptomyces and has since then been isolated from other actinomycetes after the screening of microbial alkaloids by the Kitasato Research Institute of Japan in 1977.\n92\n It is an effective inhibitor of PKC and many other kinases (including tyrosine protein kinases), which prevent the transfer of phosphate from DNA to the activated tyrosine site, which directly inhibits the activity of topoisomerase II.\n93\n It can also induce apoptosis of many types of cells, including various cancer cells.\n94\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.3.3\n          Epothilone\n          Epothilone is a natural cytotoxic compound extracted from myxobacteria and Cysticercus cellulosus.\n95\n Similar to taxane, epomycin can induce the formation of microtubule bundles and inhibit microtubule dynamics, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and mitotic arrest.\n96\n Its activity is 10\u20131000 times higher than that of paclitaxel, and most importantly, unlike paclitaxel, ebolomycin can easily be used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of cancer.\n97\n Atpresent, phase I\u2010III clinical trials are being conducted on five types of ebomycin compounds. In particular, two natural compounds, Epothilone B acid (EPO906) and Epothilone D (KOS\u2010862), and three semisynthetic derivatives of ebomycin B (BMS247550, BMS310705 and ABJ879).\n98\n These compounds have been shown to exert a therapeutic effect on NSCLC, ovarian cancer, and taxane\u2010resistant tumors.\n99\n Among them, BMS247550 was approved for use in the United States by the FDA on October 16, 2007. Thus far, it is the first apomycin analog to have received approval and is considered the most effective antineoplastic drug.\n100\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.3.4\n          Mitomycin C (MMC)\n          Mitomycin, also known as mitomycin C, is a cytotoxic antibiotic that was first isolated from Streptococcus Kaisers and was approved for use in the USA in 2002.\n21\n Mitomycin C is commonly used as a cytotoxic agent against hematological malignancies and other cancers.\n101\n It has been used to treat NSCLC since 1984,\n102\n and it can be combined with platinum\u2010based

frequently used in East Asia and North America. Ginsenosides, the main components extracted from ginseng, exert various bioactivities, such as anti\u2010tumor, immunomodulatory, antioxidant produce, and anti\u2010inflammation effects.\n11\n Ginsenosides mainly exert their anticancer effects on lung, breast, liver, and colorectal cancers. Ginsenoside Rg3, Rh2, and compound K are the main bioactive compounds in ginsenosides that produce anticancer effects.\n12\n Among them, ginsenoside Rg3\u00a0has been approved as an anticancer drug by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2000 and was listed as a designated drug for the treatment of NSCLC in the Clinical Practice Guide of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (Chinese version) in 2006 and 2007.\n13\n Protopanaxadiol (PPT) and Propanaxadiol (PPD), two metabolites of ginsenosides, have also shown activity against a variety of cancer cells while PPT is more effective in inhibiting the viability and invasiveness of lung cancer cells, especially lung squamous cells.\n11\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.2\n          Camptothecin (CPT)\n          Camptothecin (CPT) was the first natural compound derived from Camptotheca acuminata. It is a quinoline alkaloid that was first synthesized by Wall and Wani in 1966.\n14\n Topotecan, a derivative of camptothecin, has been used as a first\u2010line and second\u2010line chemotherapeutic drug for SCLC. In the European Union and the United States, it is considered as the only drug suitable for use as a second\u2010line chemotherapeutic drug for recurrent SCLC. Irinotecan in combination with cisplatin has been used for the treatment of SCLC.\n15\n Recently published in vitro and in vivo studies on CPT and its derivatives, such as irinotecan (CPT\u201011, 4), Belotecan (CKD\u2010602, 5), and 10\u2010hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), have reported that they exert a wide range of anti\u2010tumor activities on multiple types of tumors, including ovarian cancer, NSCLC, and refractory colorectal cancer.\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n Belo is a relatively new camptothecin derivative approved in Korea for the treatment of NSCLC and ovarian cancers. Compared with older camptothecin preparations, belotecan has been reported to show a similar effective level and a decreased toxic level.\n19\n Several other camptothecin analogs, including 7\u2010(4\u2010methylpiperazinomethylene)\u201010, 9\u2010aminocamptothecin, exatecan mesylate, 11\u2010ethylenedioxy\u201020(S)\u2010camptothecin, 9\u2010nitrocamptothecin, and karenitecin, are also at various stages of clinical development.\n20\n However, the side effects of their use include diarrhea, fatigue, myelosuppression, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hair loss, and peripheral neuropathy.\n21\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.3\n          Curcumin (CUR)\n          Turmeric is a spice originally found in India used in curries and as a natural colorant. It contains three bioactive polyphenols: curcumin (CUR), demethoxycurcumin (DMC), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BMC).\n22\n In a paper published in 1949 in the Journal Nature, Schraufstatter and his colleagues reported that curcumin is a bioactive compound with antibacterial properties that are active against a variety of bacterial strains.\n23\n Curcumin is also known to exert antioxidant and anticancer effects and is important for the treatment or prevention of various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\n24\n Its anticancer activity was confirmed in 1980 by Kuttan and his colleagues using in vitro and in vivo models.\n23\n Zhang et al. first proved that curcumin exerts anticancer effects using human lung adenocarcinoma cells with multidrug resistance to A549/DDP.\n25\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.4\n          \u03b2\u2010elemene (\u03b2\u2010ELE)\n          \u03b2\u2010elemene is a natural sesquiterpene extracted from turmeric, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and is a non\u2010cytotoxic II antineoplastic drug.\n26\n \u03b2\u2010elemene has been approved to treat many types of cancers, including brain, breast, prostate, ovarian, and lung cancer, with no severe side effects being reported. It can inhibit the migration, invasion, proliferation and enhance the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells.\n27\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.5\n          Gambogic (GA)\n          GA is a natural product extracted from Han's Geng Huang resin. Since ancient times, it has been used as a detoxification, anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010parasitic drug in China and Southeast Asia.\n28\n The use of GA, which has the molecular formula C38H44O9 (628.34\u00a0g/mol),\n29\n is advantageous since it produces low levels of toxicity, resistance to many cell lines and multiple mechanisms, and is a potential anti\u2010tumor compound. The National Medical Products Administration has approved GA for use in treating advanced lung, liver, stomach, breast and colon cancers after the successful conclusion of clinical trials.\n30\n The CFDA has also approved it for clinical trials for the therapy of various other types of cancers.\n31\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.6\n          Tanshinone\n          \nSalvia miltiorrhiza has high medicinal value in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and can be used to treat a variety of cardio\u2010cerebrovascular diseases, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and acute ischemic stroke.\n32\n Recent studies have shown that Salvia miltiorrhiza is an effective inhibitor of platelet agglutination. Additionally, clinical trials have shown that Salvia miltiorrhiza is also effective for treating and preventing Alzheimer's disease.\n33\n Nakao et al. isolated tanshinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza for the first time since the 1930s, and since then, more than 90 derived chemical constituents have been identified. These compounds can be divided into compounds with over 40 lipophilic components and compounds with over 50 hydrophilic compounds.\n34\n Among them, the proportion of tanshinone IIA (TSA, Tan IIA) is the highest. Accumulated evidence has shown that tanshinone IIA exerts a broad\u2010spectrum of anti\u2010tumor properties against various malignant human tumors.\n32\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.7\n          Licorice chalcone (LIC)\n          Licorice is a traditional Chinese medicinal drug widely used in clinical settings. Its main function involves the regulation of temperature, moisturization of the lungs, alleviation of toxicity, and coordination of the properties of drugs.\n35\n It is used to treat gastritis, ulceration, coughs, bronchitis, and inflammation.\n36\n In addition to triterpenes, about 300 polyphenols, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, flavanes, chalcones, and isoflavones, with a concentration of 1%\u20135% each, have been isolated from licorice root and licorice extract.\n37\n Among them, licorice chalcone A (LICA), Licochalcone B (LCB), and Licochalcone D (LCD) have been proven to provide a variety of health benefits, including anticancer effects.\n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.8\n          Triptolide (TPL)\n          The root extract of Tripterygium wilfordii has been used to treat various diseases throughout history. TPL was first isolated from the Chinese herbal medicine Tripterygium wilfordii in 1972\n42\n and is a diterpene lactone compound that contains three epoxy groups and is the main active component of Tripterygium wilfordii. Therefore, the discovery of TPL has paved the way for further anti\u2010tumor studies on triptolide.\n43\n TPL can inhibit cancer cell growth and exhibit preclinical anti\u2010tumor activity on many types of cancers, including neuroblastoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple gastrointestinal cancers (e.g., cancers of the stomach, liver, colon, and pancreas).\n42\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.9\n          Emodin (ED)\n          Emodin is a natural active anthraquinone compound extracted from the rhubarb rhizome.\n44\n Pharmacological studies have shown that emodin exerts a wide variety of activity, including anti\u2010inflammation and anti\u2010tumor effects, and prevents the development of many health issues, such as lung injury, pancreatitis, intestinal mucosal injury, and ulcerative colitis.\n45\n Previous studies have shown that emodin exerts its antiproliferative effects on various cancer cells, including lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n46\n Emodin can inhibit the growth and apoptosis of A549 cells through its action on the external apoptosis pathway and the induction of cell cycle arrest.\n47\n\n\n          \n            Berberine (BBR)\n            \nCoptis chinensis is a traditional Chinese medicinal drug of high value that is commonly used in China. Berberine is the primary bioactive component of Coptis chinensis, accounting for 5.20%\u20137.69% of all compounds.\n48\n It exerts various pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti\u2010microbial, liver protection, anti\u2010inflammatory, anti\u2010tumor, neuroprotection, blood lipid, and hypoglycemic effects.\n49\n Recent studies have indicated that BBR exerts its anticancer effects on several high\u2010risk cancers, including lung, prostate, colorectal, breast, and gastric cancer.\n50\n Additionally, other in vitro studies on tumor cell lines have shown that BBR inhibits cancer cell proliferation and migration and induces the apoptosis of a variety of cancer cell lines.\n51\n\n\n          \n        \n        \n          2.1.10\n          Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)\n          Green tea is a popular non\u2010alcoholic drink in Asian countries, and its long\u2010term consumption has been found to provide many health benefits. A 10\u2010year prospective cohort study conducted in Japan found that drinking 10 cups of green tea (120\u00a0ml/cup) a day delayed cancer onset.\n52\n Catechin is the main active ingredient in green tea. The main catechins are (\u2010)\u2010epicatechin gallate (ECG), (\u2010)\u2010epicatechin (EC), (\u2010)\u2010epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin, and (\u2010)\u2010epigallocatechin\u20103\u2010gallate (EGCG).\n53\n EGCG is the main catechin found in green tea and accounts for 50\u2010\u201080% of the total quantity of catechins. EGCG exerts antioxidant activity and affects a variety of human diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, stroke and obesity.\n54\n Animal and cell line studies have shown that EGCG plays a crucial role in promoting apoptosis and reducing cancer growth, and is potential chemoprophylaxis and therapeutic compound for skin cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers.\n55\n\n\n        \n        \n          2.1.11\n          Resveratrol (RSV)\n          Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is commonly found in red wine, peanuts, and grapes.

Apoptosis known as programmed cell death is a series of changes mediated by genes, which has an important effect on maintaining a variety of cell functions, bodies remove aging, and abnormal cells through this process.\n116\n The imbalance of apoptosis is an important way for cancer cells to survive, recur and acquire drug resistance, which involves a variety of regulatory mechanisms and signal pathways.\n117\n, \n118\n This is also an important mechanism for natural products to play an anticancer role.\n        \n          3.1.1\n          Inductive ROS\n          ROS is a natural by\u2010product of cell metabolism (mainly in the mitochondria). It is composed of hydroxyl groups, superoxide anions, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide, containing unpaired valence electrons, and therefore high levels of reactivity. Cancer cells in advanced tumors usually show high levels of oxidative stress, indicating that tumor progression requires an increased ROS level and a decrease in the tolerance of cancer cells to ROS.\n119\n\n\n          The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signal transduction pathway adjusts oxidative stress response, and its high constitutive expression induces chemical resistance and proliferation in many cancer types, including in the development of drug resistance in NSCLC. Ginsenoside Rd (GS\u2010Rd) can decrease chemical resistance by downregulating the activity of the NRF2.\n120\n Triptolide can also significantly inhibit the expression and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, which was found to have increased the chemical sensitivity of cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs in vitro and xenograft tumor model systems.\n121\n\n\n          Ginsenoside Rh2 inhibits H1299 cell growth by inducing ER stress\u2010dependent apoptosis, mediated by ROS.\n122\n GA can also inhibit the MAPK/ERK, NF\u2010\u03baB, and PI3\u00a0K/AKT signaling pathways by improving the level of reactive oxygen species \n123\n and induce tumor cell apoptosis and destroy cancer cells through ROS\u2010induced ER stress.\n124\n The inhibitory effect of Tan IIA on the growth of H146 cells may be related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which can induce ROS release and a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) caused by an increase in the Bax/Bcl\u20102 ratio.\n125\n\n\n          Emodin is most likely to affect cancer prevention/treatment by exerting its effects on mitochondria and acting as a universal crucial effector of cell death, through the reactive oxygen species\u2010ATM\u2010p53\u2010Bax signal pathway.\n126\n Su et al. have proven that emodin induces the apoptosis of human NSCLC cells through the reactive oxygen\u2010dependent mitochondrial signal transduction pathway.\n127\n Tanshinone IIA was found to have activated the p53\u2010independent, ROS\u2010triggered, and caspase\u2010dependent mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway in A549\u2010NQO1 and H596\u2010NQO1 cells, which was characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl\u2010xl ratio, MMP destruction, cytochrome c release, and subsequent caspase activation and PARP\u20101 cleavage.\n128\n Chiu et al. also found that tanshinone IIA induces the apoptosis of A549 cells by inducing the release of reactive oxygen species and decreasing the MMP.\n129\n LCD can induce apoptosis through the accumulation of ROS in lung cancer cells, increasing the loss of MMP and the upregulation or downregulation of mitochondrial\u2010related proteins, which leads to apoptotic cell death through the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway.\n41\n To amplify the therapeutic effect of EGCG, magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) encapsulated in bovine serum albumin (BSA) and loaded with EGCG were synthesized to induce apoptosis through the participation of ROS, resulting in the loss of MMP, increase in the expression of Nrf2 and Keap1, regulation of the apoptosis of A549 cells, and induction of EGCG to exert a more substantial anti\u2010lung cancer effect.\n130\n In A549 cells, artemisinin can significantly induce apoptosis through reactive oxygen species\u2010mediated amplification of the activation loop between caspase\u20103, caspase\u20108, and caspase\u20109.\n131\n Besides, Artesunate may play a cytotoxic role in A549 cells and normal HBE cells through ROS\u2010mediated DNA damage.\n60\n\n\n        \n        \n          3.1.2\n          Inductive endoplasmic reticulum stress\n          Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is a cellular response to protein misfolding, which has a far\u2010reaching influence on the survival and death of cancer cells. Its activation markers include ATF\u20106, CHOP, and ATF\u20104, BIP and XBP\u20101.\n132\n ERS plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. At the same time, the \u03b2\u2010elemene upregulates the expression levels of ER\u2010related proteins, such as ATF6, PERK, IRE\u03b1, ATF4, and CHOP, and downregulates the expression of Bcl\u20102, which inhibits lung cancer growth and cell viability in a dose\u2010dependent and time\u2010dependent manner.\n133\n Ginsenoside extract (TGS) can induce NSCLS cell autophagy by activating ERS, mediated by the ATF4\u2010CHOP\u2010AKT1\u2010mTOR axis of NSCLC cells.\n132\n\n\n          Lou et al. studied human lung adenocarcinoma PC9 cell lines and transplanted tumor models into nude mice and found that tanshinone showed sound anti\u2010lung cancer effects. Simultaneously, its mechanism of action was related to the promotion of apoptosis induced by ERS and the activation of the IRE1 \u03b1/caspase\u201012 apoptosis pathway.\n134\n The inhibitory effect of Tan IIA on the proliferation of H146 cells may be related to ERS, which is caused by the release of Ca2+ and the increased expression of GADD153, while the decrease in the expression of Bcl\u20102 leads to an increase of the Bax/Bcl\u20102 ratio, which in turn leads to a decrease in MMP and increased caspase\u20103 expression.\n125\n\n\n          LicA increases the expression levels of ERS related proteins, such as p\u2010EIF2 \u03b1 and ATF4, to inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells.\n135\n LicA also significantly promotes the expression of the tumor suppressor, miR\u2010144\u20103p, which upregulates the ER stress response protein, CHOP, and induces lung cancer cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of the nuclear factor E2\u2010related protein (Nrf2).\n136\n CHOP, which is known as a DNA damage\u2010inducing and growth arrest gene, is one of the most critical components of the ER stress network and its activation is essential for LicA\u2010induced apoptosis, cell viability, and autophagy.\n39\n LicA treatment induces ER stress activation, which leads to apoptotic cell death and exerts an anti\u2010tumor effect that significantly decreases the level of cisplatin\u2010induced renal damage but does not affect its anticancer effect.\n135\n GRP78 is the molecular chaperone of the ER that contributes to the correct folding of newborn peptides. When unfolded proteins accumulate, GRP78 triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which activates transcription factors such as XBP1 and CHOP, to restore stressed cell homeostasis. The increased expression of GRP78 and mild UPR may be present in cancer cells that promote cell survival and prevent apoptosis. Exposure to EGCG further increases GRP78 expression in the ER and induces XBP1, CHOP, and EDEM expression spliced by ATF4. It also decreases the expression of GRP78 on the cell surface and increases the activity of caspase\u20108 and caspase\u20103.\n137\n GRP78 and CHOP expression can also be detected in lung cancer cells treated with emodin, indicating that emodin can induce the apoptosis of lung cancer cells mediated by ERS.\n138\n (Figure\u00a01).\n          \n            FIGURE 1\n            \n              Natural extracts can induce apoptosis through ERS pathway and mitochondrial pathway. In this and below figures, the red thick line arrow indicates that the compound can increase the expression or activity of the corresponding protein, and the thick black line indicates that the compound can reduce the expression of the corresponding protein or inhibit the activity of the protein\n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          3.1.3\n          Induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway\n          Mitochondria play a significant role in the physiology of cancer cells. Most tumor cells are resistant to apoptosis and can be regarded as the primary regulators of cell life and death.\n117\n The most decisive event induced by the mitochondrial pathway during apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP), with MOMP being highly regulated by members of the BCL\u20102 protein family. This family can be categorized as pro\u2010apoptotic proteins (BAK and BAX), pro\u2010apoptotic BH3 protein (BIM, Noxa, BMF, BIK, PUMA, BID, HRK, and BAD) and anti\u2010apoptotic BCL\u20102 protein (BCL\u2010xL, BCL\u2010BA1, BCL\u20102, MCL\u20101, and BCL\u2010w). After MOMP, mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins (especially cytochrome c) are released into the cytoplasm, activating cystatin.\n139\n\n\n          The combination of ginsenoside and paclitaxel was found to have upregulated the expression of caspase\u20103 protein and downregulated the ratio of Bcl\u20102/Bax, which significantly increased the apoptosis\u2010inducing effect on A549 cells.\n140\n CK\u2010M exerts a good tumor targeting effect within 24 hours and maybe a suitable delivery agent to enhance the solubility and anti\u2010tumor effect of CK. TPGS/PEG\u2010PCL mixed micelle (CK\u2010M) promotes tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell metastasis, invasion, and efflux by regulating levels of Bax, Bcl\u20102, matrix metalloproteinase\u20102, P\u2010glycoprotein, caspase\u20103, and caspase\u20102.\n141\n The combination of curcumin and cisplatin significantly inhibited A549/DDP cell proliferation, reversed DDP resistance, and induced apoptosis by activating caspase\u20103, and promoting HIF\u20101\u03b1 degradation.\n142\n In addition, curcumin reduces Bcl\u20102 levels through ubiquitin\u2010proteasome degradation, making NSCLC cells sensitive to apoptosis.\n143\n \u03b2\u2010elemene increased the expression of Bax, decreased the expression of Bcl\u20102 and induced PARP cleavage, and enhanced apoptosis induced by \u03b2\u2010elemene.\n144\n The combination of \u03b2\u2010ELE and cisplatin decreased the protein levels of procaspase\u20103 and Bcl\u20102 in A549/DDP cells and increased the protein expression of caspase\u20103, cytochrome c, and Bad in A549/DDP cell lines, indicating that \u03b2\u2010ELE reversed the drug resistance of A549/DDP cells by inducing apoptosis.\n145\n\n\n          Tan IIA can also induce JNK signal activation and trigger cascade apoptosis mediated by cytochrome c release.\n146\n Tan IIA combined with cyclophosphamide (CTX) can regulate Bcl\u20102 and Bax expressions in lung cancer tissues of Lewis mice, inhibit the neovascularization of tumor tissue, enhance immune function, and exert evident anti\u2010tumor activity.\n147\n Li et al. found that emodin can inhibit the proliferation of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Anip\u2010973 by activating caspase\u20103 induced apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle.\n148\n It also enhanced the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by PTX and the anti\u2010tumor effect on A549 xenografts by increasing the expression of Bax and active cystatin\u20103 and decreasing levels of p\u2010Akt, Bcl\u20102, and p\u2010ERK, while there were no apparent side effects in vivo.\n44\n A549 cells expressing wild\u2010type p53 and H1299 cells with p53 deficiency could inhibit cell proliferation and increase the apoptosis rate when A549 cells were treated with berberine. A549 cells were more sensitive to berberine\u2010induced cytotoxicity. Apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells induced by berberine was related to the destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential, a decrease of Bcl\u20102 and Bcl\u2010xl levels, and the increase of Bax and Bak levels, as well as activation of caspase\u20103.\n149\n\n\n          Artesunate can induce apoptosis through the Bak\u2010mediated caspase\u2010independent intrinsic pathway in human NSCLC cells.\n150\n Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine, Artemisia annua, induced apoptosis of SPC\u2010A\u20101 cells by downregulating the expression of surviving at mRNA and protein levels, but did not affect caspase\u20104.\n151\n It was also able to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of ASTC\u2010a\u20101 cells through the caspase\u20103 dependent mitochondrial death pathway.\n152\n Methoxycinnamaldehyde (2\u2010MCA), a component of cinnamon bark, was also able to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, which was characterized by the upregulation of Bax and Bak genes and pro\u2010apoptotic and downregulation of Bcl\u20102, anti\u2010apoptotic and Bcl\u2010XL genes, the release of caspase\u20103, loss of MMP, cytochrome c and caspase\u20109 and their activation.\n153\n (Figure\u00a01).\n        \n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Induction of autophagy\n        Autophagy is a biological process that is stimulated in response to various stresses (including hunger, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia, and DNA damage), in which membrane receptors receive signals transmitted to the cell,\n14\n and maintain balance in the body by capturing and degrading damaged proteins and organelles, which in turn is considered to promote an inhibitory effect on cancer cells.\n154\n\n\n        There are two types of autophagy: the first type, known as protective autophagy, protects against apoptosis, while the other is autophagic cell death, which induces the death of cancer cells. The GA\u2010induced autophagy of NCI\u2010H441 cells belongs to the latter type of autophagy and is mediated by ROS production.\n119\n Compared with tanshinone IIA, total tanshinone (TDT) showed more potent cytotoxic effects on 95D lung cancer cells, and apoptosis and protective autophagy induced by TDT were also mediated by an increase in intracellular ROS production.\n155\n When A549 cells were treated with cryptotanshinone (CTS), autophagic vesicles were found to have accumulated and the expression of LC3 protein and autophagosomes increased, proving that cryptotanshinone could exert its anti\u2010tumor effect by promoting autophagy.\n156\n Curcumin can induce autophagy by controlling hST8SiaI gene expression, related to the autophagy of A549 cells through the AMPK signaling pathway.\n157\n Wild\u2010type p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is important for cancer prevention. Emodin can target the accumulation of p53 protein in A549 cells and increase autophagy.\n158\n In addition, resveratrol is an activator of SIRT1 that induces protective autophagy in NSCLC by activating p38\u2010MAPK and inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway \n159\n to overcome gefitinib resistance through autophagy and aging.\n160\n\n\n        Many studies have shown that autophagy can enhance tumor resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiotherapy.\n161\n The inhibition of autophagy heightens the level of DNA damage induced by CPT in lung cancer cell lines, indicating that autophagy exerts a protective effect on lung cancer cells treated with CPT, and the combination of CPT and specific autophagy inhibitors can be considered as a promising therapeutic method for lung cancer in the future.\n14\n The inhibition of autophagy induced by Rg3 can increase the therapeutic response of etinib\u2010sensitive and etinib\u2010resistant NSCLC cells with EGFR\u2010activated mutations.\n162\n EGCG overcomes gefitinib (Gef) resistance by targeting ERK phosphorylation in NSCLC to inhibit autophagy and enhance cell death.\n163\n (Figure\u00a02).\n        \n          FIGURE 2\n          \n            Natural extracts exert inhibitory effects on lung cancer by inducing autophagy\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Inhibition of the PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway\n        It is well known that the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway is one of the most vital carcinogenic pathways in almost all cancers. The PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway has an essential effect on regulating cell survival, growth, apoptosis, and autophagy.\n164\n Activated Akt regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration by inhibiting a series of downstream substrates, such as caspase\u20109, GSK23, NF\u2010\u03baB, and Bad.\n165\n Therefore, the PI3\u00a0K\u2010AKT pathway seems to be one of the most promising targets for anticancer drugs.\n        Rad51 activity is related to tumorigenesis or tumor progression and may be a useful prognostic marker in NSCLC. Its high expression indicates a significant decrease in the survival rate. Astaxanthin downregulates Rad51 expression by inactivating AKT to enhance the mitomycin C\u2010induced cytotoxicity of human NSCLC cells.\n74\n PTEN negatively regulates the Akt signal pathway by degenerating PIP3 phosphate into PIP2. The PTEN gene is often mutated in many different types of cancers. A study observed that CTN treatment increased the upregulation of PTEN, while PTEN degraded PIP3, resulting in a decrease of Akt phosphorylation of Ser 473 and Thr 308. Akt inactivation reduces the degradation of p53, which ultimately leads to the increased expression of p21 and p53, and inhibition of tumor progression, indicating that tanshinone induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and inhibition of the PTEN\u2010mediated PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway for effectively inhibiting tumor growth.\n164\n PESV (peptides from BmK scorpion venom) can also increase the expression of PTEN in cultured A549 cells.\n86\n Epothilone B may enhance the apoptosis of human cancer cells induced by the Bcl\u20102 antagonist, ABT\u2010737, through the PI3\u00a0K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway.\n99\n EGCG can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of H1299 cells, which is relevant to the inhibition of the activation of the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway and downregulation of the expressions of p\u2010PI3\u00a0K and p\u2010Akt in lung cancer cells.\n165\n\n\n        Metastasis is a multi\u2010step process that involves the overexpression of proteolytic enzymes, such as urokinase\u2010type plasminogen activator (u\u2010PA) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), MMP or u\u2010PA gene expression, mainly at the transcriptional level (through the MAPK or PI3\u00a0K\u2010Akt pathway through AP\u20101 or NF\u2010\u03baB) and post\u2010transcriptional level, and it is regulated or inhibited by its activator at the protein level. Silybin can prevent Akt phosphorylation from inhibiting the PI3\u00a0K\u2010Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting lung cancer cell invasion.\n166\n In addition, Rg3 may also inhibit the apoptosis of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway.\n167\n\n\n        Extensive studies have shown that MDR cells can resist apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs by upregulating survival signaling pathways (including PI3\u00a0K and ERK1) or inhibiting antiproliferative signaling pathways, including the p38 MAPK. Triptolide promotes the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of drug\u2010resistant A549/Taxol cells by regulating the MAPK and PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathways.\n168\n The combination of triptolide and hydroxycamptothecin induces the apoptosis of human lung cancer cells by increasing PP2A activity, activating p38, ERK, and MAPK cascade reactions and by inhibiting the Akt survival pathway through mechanisms that involve PP2A activation, which synergistically enhances the effect of triptolide on A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.\n169\n\n\n        GA and cisplatin (CDDP) produced a synergistic growth inhibition effect on NCI\u2010H460 and A549 cells. GA treatment decreased the activation of Akt, mTOR, and S6, which may target autophagy\u2010dependent cell death by activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n170\n The combination of tanshinone IIA and cisplatin at a ratio of 20:1 can impair cell invasion and migration, block the cell cycle at the S phase, and induce the apoptosis of A549 and PC9 cells in a synergistic manner, probably due to the downregulation of the expression of the p\u2010Akt and p\u2010PI3\u00a0K proteins, which affect the PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway, as a result of the activity of tanshinone IIA.\n171\n The synergistic anti\u2010tumor activity of curcumin and carboplatin is due to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation that inhibits the Akt/IKK\u03b1 pathway and enhancement of ERK1/2 activity to inhibit NF\u2010\u03baB, allowing carboplatin to act as a chemical sensitizer.\n172\n Wang et al. demonstrated that Tan IIA enhanced NSCLC cell sensitivity to gefitinib by downregulating the VEGFR2/Akt pathway (downregulating the phosphorylation levels of VEGFR2 and Akt) in vivo and in vitro.\n173\n\n\n        XRCC1 is a major scaffolding protein involved in base excision repair. It is regulated by ERK1/2 and AKT signaling and is significantly involved in lung cancer development. Resveratrol enhances the etoposide\u2010induced cytotoxicity of human NSCLC cells by downregulating ERK1/2 and AKT\u2010mediated XRCC1 protein expression.\n174\n In NCI\u2010H1975 cells treated with DHA and gefitinib, the expression of pMIT and p\u2010STAT3 was significantly downregulated, indicating that both of them synergistically inhibit the growth and promote the apoptosis of NSCLC cells through the Akt/mTOR/STAT3 pathway.\n175\n (Figure\u00a03).\n        \n          FIGURE 3\n          \n            Natural extracts exert inhibitory effects on PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.4\n        Inhibition of the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway\n        There is considerable evidence that NF\u2010\u03baB is constitutively activated in many types of solid tumors, including cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.\n176\n NF\u2010\u03baB exerts its role by activating various downstream signal transduction cascades, such as the TNF\u2010\u03b1, BCL\u20102, and STAT 3 pathways. Previous studies have shown that increased expression of NF\u2010\u03baB can be detected in NSCLC tissues and acts as a tumor promoter in NSCLC. In addition, the overexpression of NF\u2010\u03baB is related to cancer cell metastasis and the poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC.\n177\n\n\n        Epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is an essential factor during the metastasis of bronchogenic carcinoma. Rg3 inhibits EMT and the invasive ability of lung cancer by downregulating EGFR inactivation mediated by FUT4 and blocking the MAPK and NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathways.\n178\n Saponin Rg3 + cisplatin can inhibit hypoxia\u2010induced EMT and cancer cell stemness due to the inactivation of the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway caused by Rg3.\n13\n Extracellular ATP performs many significant functions by activating P2 receptors on the cell surface. Emodin inhibits ATP\u2010induced EMT, migration, and proliferation by inhibiting the P2Y receptor\u2010mediated increase of Ca2+ and NF\u2010\u03baB signal transduction in A549 cells.\n179\n GA inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB signal transduction, in turn inhibiting the EMT process induced by TGF\u2010\u03b21 through the inhibition of the expression of TWIST1, which leads to inhibition of lung growth and metastasis of A549 cells.\n180\n\n\n        Programmed death ligand 1 (PD\u2010L1) is highly expressed on the surface of a variety of human cancer cells, such as malignant melanoma, NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. It has been confirmed that it is involved in the chemotherapeutic resistance of NSCLC. PD\u2010L1 is a new target for the treatment of lung cancer cells. Rk1 inhibits PD\u2010L1 expression and promotes apoptosis by inhibiting NF\u2010\u03ba B signal transduction. Thus, it inhibits the proliferation of A549 and PC9 cells.\n181\n Rg3 can inhibit the growth of A549/DDP cells and reduce their resistance to cisplatin by preventing the expression of NF\u2010\u03baB from decreasing the expression of PD\u2010L1 induced by chemical resistance and restoring the cytotoxicity of T cells toward cancer cells.\n182\n\n\n        Low concentrations of triptolide may bind to high\u2010affinity targets to activate p38\u03b1 and ERK1/2, and block the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB induced by TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101 \u03b2 through p53.\n183\n Luteinic acid and its analogs inhibit IKK\u03b2 kinase activity by inhibiting the activation of the TNF\u03b1/NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, which in turn induces apoptosis in A549 and U251 cells.\n184\n DHA can inhibit lung cancer cell metastasis by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB/GLUT1 axis.\n185\n The inhibitory effect of silybin on lung tumor growth can also be achieved through the regulation of macrophage\u2010associated cytokines, NF\u2010\u03baB, as well as signal transduction and transcriptional activators on angiogenesis.\n186\n BV can induce apoptosis of A549 and NCI\u2010H460 cells by increasing the expression of death receptor 3 (DR3) and inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. BV combined with the TNF\u2010like weak apoptosis inducer, docetaxel, and cisplatin can synergistically inhibit the growth of A549 and NCI\u2010H460 cells further to downregulate the activity of NF\u2010\u03baB.\n187\n\n\n        The resveratrol targeting NF\u2010\u03baB (p65) pathway can decrease TRAIL drug resistance, sanitizing lung cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL, and allowing the induction of TRAIL\u2010mediated apoptosis.\n60\n TPL also inhibits the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB by blocking the transactivation of p65, sanitizing A549, and NCI\u2010H1299 cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL.\n188\n It can also reverse the paclitaxel resistance of lung cancer by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway and regulating the transcription and expression of drug resistance genes.\n189\n Ginsenoside Rg3 can inhibit the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, the phosphorylation of I\u03baB protein and the expression of NF\u2010\u03baB regulated gene products (promotes apoptosis, cyclin\u2010D1, cyclin\u20102, cyclooxygenase\u20102, and VEGF) by targeting the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, sensitizing human NSCLC cells to \u03b3 radiation.\n190\n The synergistic anti\u2010tumor activity of curcumin and carboplatin is due to the inhibition of the Akt/IKK\u03b1 pathway and the enhancement of ERK1/2 activity that inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB for carboplatin to act as a chemical sensitizer.\n172\n GA and ADM (Adriamycin) exert a potent anti\u2010tumor effect on the A549 xenograft model by inhibiting P\u2010glycoprotein and NF\u2010\u03baB, attenuating ADM\u2010induced cardiotoxicity, and sensitizing lung cancer cells to ADM.\n191\n (Figure\u00a04).\n        \n          FIGURE 4\n          \n            Natural extracts block NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.5\n        The arrest of the cell cycle\n        The regular process of cell division occurs through the cell cycle, which is a sequence of highly ordered steps, which are usually divided into G0/G1, S, G2, and M phases. These steps are regulated at the molecular level by several regulators, including cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin\u2010D, and CDK inhibitor (CKI).\n192\n, \n193\n In recent years, studies have found that normal cells proliferate only in response to specific mitotic signals and growth stimuli, while cancer cells proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. In addition, almost all molecular types involved in the regulation of cell proliferation are involved in malignant transformation. Therefore, cancer can be regarded as a cell cycle disease.\n194\n\n\n        Myc expression is strictly controlled by the availability of mitogens in normal cells but is usually misregulated or elevated in tumor cells.\n195\n Emodin can downregulate the C\u2010myc gene expression to induce cell cycle arrest and induce growth inhibition of A549 cells.\n47\n TPL inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by nucleolus decomposition and rRNA synthesis inhibition (possibly through the ribosomal\u2010RPL23\u2010MDM2\u2010p53 signaling pathway).\n196\n BBR inhibits AP\u20101 signaling pathway activity and reduces the binding of transcription factors to the CCND1 AP\u20101 motifs, which is an essential mechanism for the action of berberine as a cyclin\u2010D1 regulator against human lung giant cell carcinoma.\n197\n Low concentrations of ART inhibit mRNA levels of cyclin\u2010related genes, including CDK2, CDK1, cyclin\u2010D1, CDK6, cyclin\u2010B1, and cyclin\u2010A2, which lead to cell cycle arrest of NSCLC cells.\n198\n Silybin inhibits human NSCLC cell growth by regulating the expression and function of key cell cycle regulators, reducing the protein levels of G1\u2010related CDK\n2\n, \n4\n, \n6\n and their corresponding cyclins\u2010D1 and D3, and inducing arrest of the cell cycle at G1.\n199\n The combination of silybin and indole\u20103\u2010methanol (I3C) also enhanced the inhibitory effect of lung adenocarcinoma in A/J mice,\n65\n mainly by inhibiting the inflammatory drive by regulating key cell cycle regulatory factors and reducing the level of cyclin\u2010D1 and related proteins.\n200\n The Rb gene plays an essential role in regulating tumor cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis. The Rb gene was found to be activated by a low concentration of mitomycin C enhanced the inhibition of proliferation, significantly increased the number of cells at the G1/G0 phase and decreased the number of cells at the S and G2/M phases, indicating that the inhibitory effect of mitomycin C on A549 cells is induced mainly through cell cycle arrest.\n101\n\n\n        Ginsenoside Rh2 can activate the JNK/MAPK signaling pathway, increase the transcriptional and phosphorylation activity of transcription factors(ATF2 and AP\u20101), reduce the expression of transcription factors(C\u2010myc and E2F1), and affect the expression of CDK4 and cyclin\u2010D1, which are the critical regulators of G1/S cyclin\u2010dependent kinases.\n201\n Saha also found that curcumin can induce the expression of cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitors, p27 and p21, and inhibit the expression of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin\u2010D1, CDK6, and other genes, to block the cell cycle in the G1/S phase and inhibit the growth of PC\u20109 cells.\n202\n Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is associated with the development of many types of cancers and tumors, especially lung cancer. PRMT5 promotes the apoptosis of lung cancer cells through Akt/Gsk3\u03b2 signaling induced by resveratrol. Further studies have shown that the inhibition or downregulation of PRMT5 further reduces the phosphorylation of Akt/GSK3\u03b2 and the expressions of cyclins\u2010D1 and E1 among the downstream target cells treated with resveratrol.\n203\n This induces cell cycle arrest at the G0 / G1 phase in lung cancer cells.\n204\n UCN\u201001 (7\u2010hydroxystaurosporine) can inhibit CDKs and inhibit cell cycle progression of A549 cells from G1 to the S phase.\n205\n\n\n        GA was found to have induced the apoptosis of A549 cells in a time and dose\u2010dependent manner arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase in vitro, and downregulated the mRNA expression of cyclin\u2010D1 and COX\u20102, suggesting that GA could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells through apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest.\n206\n Both tanshinone nano\u2010emulsion and extract could penetrate the cytoplasm through endocytosis, which could induce the upregulation of p53 and p21 and downregulation of CDK2, cyclin\u2010E1, and cyclin\u2010D1. At the same time, the cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 phase, and tanshinone nano\u2010emulsion was found to have inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells more effectively than tanshinone extract.\n207\n Dihydroartemisinin exerts apparent anticancer activity on A549 cells, which is related to G0 and G1 phase arrest.\n208\n DHA treatment of A549 cells led to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, which was related to the downregulation of PCNA and cyclin\u2010D1 at mRNA and protein levels.\n209\n DHA induces potent cytotoxicity and radiosensitivity on GLC\u201082 cells. The mechanism of action may proceed by preventing the growth of GLC\u201082 cells at the G0/G1 phase, reducing the proportion of cells at the S phase, restoring p53 function, reducing the expression of Bcl\u20102 protein, and inducing GLC apoptosis.\n210\n Melittin was found to have induced G1 cell cycle arrest of Chago\u2010K1 human bronchial cancer cells.\n211\n\n\n        Tan IIA may block the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway, indirectly induce S\u2010phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibit the downstream signaling pathway, and subsequently upregulate the expression of apoptosis\u2010promoting genes and downregulate the expression of anti\u2010apoptosis genes, and finally inhibit the growth and proliferation of A549 cells.\n212\n Tan1 inhibits the growth and angiogenesis of lung carcinoma cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner by inhibiting the expression of cyclin\u2010A, VEGF, and cyclin\u2010B proteins, inducing a stronger effect than Tan2. This anti\u2010tumor effect may slow down the progression of cells through the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.\n213\n When lung cancer cells were treated with a nano\u2010emulsion of curcumin extract, it was found that H460 cells were more prone to apoptosis than A549 cells and that the cell cycle remained in the G2/M phase, accompanied by a dose\u2010dependent decrease in CDK1 expression.\n214\n LCA and LCD significantly decreased the expression of cyclins\u2010B1 and cdc2 in lung cancer cells, and their complexes participated in the G2/M phase transition, which is that G2/M cell cycle arrest could inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells.\n36\n, \n41\n Artesunate can increase the production of NO to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, which is relevant to the downregulation of cyclin\u2010B1 mRNA expression and improves the radiosensitivity of human NSCLC A549 cells.\n215\n ET\u2010743 induces the characteristics of medium cell line\u2010dependent radiosensitization in A549 cells, and the radiosensitization may be caused by G2/M phase arrest.\n111\n (Figure\u00a05).\n        \n          FIGURE 5\n          \n            Natural extracts can induce cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.6\n        Regulation of epigenetics\n        Few studies have shown that epigenetics plays a crucial part in the development of lung cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modification, DNA methylation, chromatin tissue, and non\u2010coding RNA, are hereditary and reversible. Many genes are silenced or uncontrolled during the carcinogenesis of lung cancer.\n216\n\n\n        MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non\u2010coding RNA of a length of 18\u201325 nucleotides, which are expressed in all cells. Their abnormal expression leads to an abnormal protein function, which leads to NSCLC tumorigenesis. Tumor tissue factor (TF) contributes to cancer metastasis in some NSCLC patients. BBR inhibits NSCLC cell growth and promotes apoptosis through the miR\u201019a/TF/MAPK signaling pathway.\n217\n Mir\u2010491 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can inhibit hypoxia\u2010induced migration, while Rh2 can exert anti\u2010metastatic activity on the hypoxic tumor microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma cells by increasing the expression of mir\u2010491.\n218\n MiR\u2010301a\u20103p is a miRNA that has been suggested to exert carcinogenic effects on many types of cancers. \u03b2\u2010elemene may weaken the Warburg effect in NSCLC cells by mediating the miR\u2010301a\u20103p/AMPK\u03b1 axis by inhibiting the expression of miR\u2010301a\u20103p in NSCLC cells and increasing the expression of AMPK\u03b1.\n219\n In addition, \u03b2\u2010elemene increases IGFBP1 gene expression through Stat3 inactivation and then produces a mutual effect between miRNA155\u20105p and FOXO3a, which leads to the inhibition of the growth of lung cancer cells.\n220\n Melittin activates caspase\u20102 (CASP2) to induce lung carcinoma cell apoptosis by inhibiting miR\u2010183 expression.\n221\n\n\n        AURKA is a carcinogenic gene that encodes for serine\u2010threonine kinase and regulates mitosis in mammalian cells. Tanshinone can inhibit AURKA, by upregulating the expression of miR\u201032 and other related miRNAs to inhibit NSCLC.\n222\n LICA was found to have reversed the expression of ectopic miRNAs induced by NNK, including miR\u2010328\u20103p, let\u20107d\u20103p, miR\u201029c\u20103p, miR\u201020a\u20105p, and miR\u2010144\u20103p, to stimulate chemoprophylaxis in vivo and in vitro.\n223\n Triptolide decreases proliferation and enhances NSCLC cell apoptosis by targeting miR\u201021 to enhance the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN).\n224\n HOTAIR is an important carcinogenic lncRNA that is involved in invasion and tumorigenesis, while miR\u201034a\u20105p plays a role in tumor suppression. The combination of BBR and gefitinib may control the growth and metastasis of NSCLC through miR\u201034a\u20105p and HOTAIR\u2010mediated EMT inhibition.\n225\n\n\n        Zhang et al. first proved that curcumin exerts anticancer effects on A549/DDP multidrug\u2010resistant cells, which changes miRNA expression, primarily by reducing the expression of miR\u2010186.\n226\n Curcumin can improve the sensitivity of paclitaxel\u2010resistant NSCLC cells to paclitaxel through microRNA\u201030c\u2010mediated MTA1 reduction.\n227\n Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the leading cause of tumor metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapeutic resistance. In serum samples of NSCLC patients, hsa\u2010mir\u2010485\u20105p expression was found to have decreased, while RXR\u03b1 (a nuclear receptor) expression was found to have increased in NSCLC. The upregulation or activation of RXR\u03b1 enhanced the CSC\u2010like characteristics of NSCLC cells. EGCG can inhibit CSC\u2010like characteristics by regulating the hsa\u2010mir\u2010485\u20105p/RXR\u03b1 axis.\n228\n The overexpression of miR\u2010485 could reduce the stemness of A549/DDP cells, while EGCG could inhibit stemness by increasing the expression of miR\u2010485 in A549/CDDP cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner.\n229\n The miRNA spectrum analysis shows that the upregulation of Myb by EGCG can be realized by the downregulation of miRNA, mmu\u2010miR\u2010449c\u20105p induced by EGCG.\n230\n Using next\u2010generation sequencing technology, KEGG analysis, and the PANTHER pathway showed that the MAPK pathway is the most effective targeting pathway for EGCG\u2010regulated microRNAs.\n55\n\n\n        As an oncogene, the novel long non\u2010coding RNA, AK001796, is concerned with cell growth inhibition induced by resveratrol in lung cancer. Microarray analysis has shown that AK001796 was the most apparent long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA), and that it is overexpressed in lung cancer cells, but that its expression was downregulated in lung cancer cells treated with resveratrol, and that the decrease of the lncRNA AK001796 level may weaken the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on cell proliferation.\n231\n Silybin can also reverse the drug resistance of human SCLC cells,\n232\n downregulate the expression of miR\u201021, and promote the re\u2010expression of miR\u2010200c in erlotinib refractory tumors, as well as inhibit EMT\u2010driven erlotinib resistance.\n233\n\n\n        Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are epigenetic enzymes that control gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylation transcription. BBR inhibits HDAC\u2010mediated epigenetic reprogramming, which may be a key mechanism of its anti\u2010tumor activity.\n234\n Mirzaaghaei et al. found that the combination of EGCG and silybin can regulate the expression of pro\u2010angiogenic miRNAs in endothelial cells with tumor cells.\n235\n It can also coordinate with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors to upregulate E\u2010cadherin expression and inhibit the migration and invasion of human NSCLC cells.\n236\n Am80 is a synthetic vitamin A, which has been used as a new drug in patients with relapsed and stubborn acute promyelocytic leukemia. EGCG binds to Am80 by downregulating the level of non\u2010histone acetylation by downregulating HDAC\u20104, HDAC\u20105, and HDAC\u20106, and stimulating the apoptosis of human lung carcinoma cells.\n237\n Berberine can inhibit N\u2010acetyltransferase activity in A549 cells and was found to show a negative correlation between dose and time to some extent, which may be one of the mechanisms of its anti\u2010tumor effect.\n238\n Resveratrol epigenetically regulates the expression of zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) in NSCLC cells. ZFP36 is an AU\u2010rich essential protein that binds to the 3\u2019\u2010untranslated region and promotes the decay of target mRNAs. The downregulation of ZFP36 expression leads to the stability of the target mRNAs.\n239\n SirT1 is a conservative NAD+\u2010dependent deacetylase, which participates in the regulation of stress response and cell survival, and seems to play an essential role in developing cancer resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and tumorigenesis. Its expression is negatively correlated with radiosensitivity. Resveratrol regulates the apoptosis and radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells through the Sirt1/NF\u2010\u03baB/Smac pathway.\n240\n RHBDD1, a mammalian member of the rhomboid family of proteins, is a highly conserved intramembranous serine protease. Silencing of RHBDD1 can inhibit cell proliferation and growth in glioblastoma, colorectal, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Silybin inhibits the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transformation of NSCLC cells by inhibiting RHBDD1 and exerts anti\u2010tumor effects on NSCLC cells.\n241\n Reverse inducible cysteine\u2010rich protein with Kazal motif (RECK) is a membrane\u2010anchored glycoprotein that negatively regulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and plays an integral role in cancer invasion and metastasis. GA inhibits experimental lung metastasis and cell invasion of A549 in a dose\u2010dependent manner, which is attributed to the fact that GA effectively inhibits the binding of histone deacetylase (HDAC)\u20101/specific protein(Sp)\u20101, and Sp1 phosphorylation is related to extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction, resulting in the upregulation of RECK at mRNA and protein levels.\n242\n In A549 cells and A549 xenografted mice, GA inhibits cell invasion and migration through a reverse\u2010induced cysteine\u2010rich protein upregulated by the kazal motif (RECK).\n243\n\n\n      \n      \n        3.7\n        Regulation of other mechanisms and the combined effect of multiple mechanisms\n        The HA\u2010CD44/RHAMM signaling pathway plays an integral role in the growth and survival of NSCLC cells. The low concentration of triptolide significantly decreased NSCLC cell growth and inhibited tumor growth in mice by targeting the HA\u2010CD44/RHAMM signaling axis.\n244\n The Nrf2/HO\u20101 signal pathway is thought to mediate cell resistance to EGCG. Metformin sensitizes NSCLC cells to EGCG by inhibiting the Nrf2/HO\u20101 signaling pathway.\n53\n Ginsenoside Rh2 induced A549 cell apoptosis through the Ras/Raf/ERK/p53 pathway.\n245\n GA can also inhibit the viability of NSCLC cells by inducing apoptosis by inhibiting the Notch signal pathway.\n246\n Tanshinone IIA increases TRAIL\u2010induced NSCLC cell death by selectively activating PERK/ATF4 and inhibiting the STAT3\u2010mediated upregulation of DR5 and downregulation of Survivin.\n247\n TPL also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, inhibited the transport of STAT3 into the nucleus, and reduced the expression of STAT3 target genes associated with apoptosis, migration, and cell survival, such as C\u2010myc, myeloid leukemia 1 (MCL\u20101), BCL2, and matrix metallopeptidase\u20109 (MMP\u20109), thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and migration and inducing cell apoptosis.\n248\n\n\n        Melittin significantly inhibited the secretion of VEGF in NSCLC cells. In addition, melittin can also reduce the protein expression of VEGF and HIF\u20101\u03b1. Therefore, the anti\u2010tumor activity of melittin may be relevant to the inhibition of the anti\u2010angiogenesis of VEGF and the hypoxia\u2010inducible factor signaling pathway.\n249\n Emodin enhances cisplatin\u2010induced cytotoxicity by downregulating ERCC1 and inactivating ERK1/2.\n250\n \u03b2\u2010elemene is a prospective drug to enhance tumor radiation response. Survivin and HIF\u20101\u03b1 are newly identified targets of \u03b2\u2010elemene.\n251\n \u03b2\u2010elemene at a radiosensitizing dose could also significantly downregulate mTOR mRNA expression, HIF\u20101a, and Survivin mRNA.\n252\n Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) play an essential role in translation initiation. Curcumin can block protein synthesis initiation by regulating eIF2a and eIF4E expressions, thus decreasing cell viability.\n253\n\n\n        Tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) play a vital part in regulating the cancer microenvironment and promoting tumor metastasis. It has two subsets: the classical subtype of activated macrophages (M1) and the alternative subtype of activated macrophages (M2). Subtype M2 macrophages stimulate a more aggressive phenotype of lung cancer cells. G\u2010Rh2 can convert TAM from the M2 subclass to that of M1 and prevent lung cancer cell migration.\n254\n CUR can induce the cell death of ASTC\u2010a\u20101 cells in a significant apoptotic manner through a caspase\u2010independent mitochondrial pathway.\n25\n As a protein with a short half\u2010life, Mcl\u20101 abundance is strictly regulated at many levels, including transcriptional, transcriptional, and post\u2010translational levels Tan IIA can be used as an EGFR signal inhibitor that targets the EGFR\u2010Akt\u2010Mcl1 axis, shortening the Mcl\u20101 half\u2010life and promoting its ubiquitination, which can provide new options for NSCLC therapy.\n255\n\n\n        Silybin can target multiple cytokine\u2010induced signaling pathways, downregulate the expression of iNOS in NSCLC cells,\n256\n and regulate the expression of iNOS and cyclooxygenase 2(COX2) in lung epithelial LM2 cells of tumorigenic mice by regulating the signals mediated by TNF\u2010\u03b1 and interferon\u2010\u03b3.\n257\n Nitric oxide (NO) signaling plays a significant role in cancer angiogenesis and is positively correlated with the occurrence and development of lung cancer. Silybin exerts most of its chemopreventive effects and vascular prophylaxis roles by inhibiting the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) \n258\n and COX\u20102 in lung tumors. These two enzymes promote the growth and progression of lung tumors by inducing VEGF expression.\n66\n The overexpression of COX\u20102 is usually associated with human NSCLC and participates in tumor invasion, angiogenesis, proliferation, and anti\u2010apoptosis. Triptolide inhibits COX\u20102 expression through COX\u20102 mRNA stability regulation and post\u2010transcriptional regulation.\n259\n Resveratrol can enhance the anticancer effect of paclitaxel on NSCLC cells in vitro by reducing COX\u20102 expression at mRNA and protein levels, indicating that resveratrol has the potential to be used as a promising sensitizer for PA.\n260\n3.1\n        Induction of apoptosis\n        Apoptosis known as programmed cell death is a series of changes mediated by genes, which has an important effect on maintaining a variety of cell functions, bodies remove aging, and abnormal cells through this process.\n116\n The imbalance of apoptosis is an important way for cancer cells to survive, recur and acquire drug resistance, which involves a variety of regulatory mechanisms and signal pathways.\n117\n, \n118\n This is also an important mechanism for natural products to play an anticancer role.\n        \n          3.1.1\n          Inductive ROS\n          ROS is a natural by\u2010product of cell metabolism (mainly in the mitochondria). It is composed of hydroxyl groups, superoxide anions, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide, containing unpaired valence electrons, and therefore high levels of reactivity. Cancer cells in advanced tumors usually show high levels of oxidative stress, indicating that tumor progression requires an increased ROS level and a decrease in the tolerance of cancer cells to ROS.\n119\n\n\n          The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signal transduction pathway adjusts oxidative stress response, and its high constitutive expression induces chemical resistance and proliferation in many cancer types, including in the development of drug resistance in NSCLC. Ginsenoside Rd (GS\u2010Rd) can decrease chemical resistance by downregulating the activity of the NRF2.\n120\n Triptolide can also significantly inhibit the expression and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, which was found to have increased the chemical sensitivity of cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs in vitro and xenograft tumor model systems.\n121\n\n\n          Ginsenoside Rh2 inhibits H1299 cell growth by inducing ER stress\u2010dependent apoptosis, mediated by ROS.\n122\n GA can also inhibit the MAPK/ERK, NF\u2010\u03baB, and PI3\u00a0K/AKT signaling pathways by improving the level of reactive oxygen species \n123\n and induce tumor cell apoptosis and destroy cancer cells through ROS\u2010induced ER stress.\n124\n The inhibitory effect of Tan IIA on the growth of H146 cells may be related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which can induce ROS release and a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) caused by an increase in the Bax/Bcl\u20102 ratio.\n125\n\n\n          Emodin is most likely to affect cancer prevention/treatment by exerting its effects on mitochondria and acting as a universal crucial effector of cell death, through the reactive oxygen species\u2010ATM\u2010p53\u2010Bax signal pathway.\n126\n Su et al. have proven that emodin induces the apoptosis of human NSCLC cells through the reactive oxygen\u2010dependent mitochondrial signal transduction pathway.\n127\n Tanshinone IIA was found to have activated the p53\u2010independent, ROS\u2010triggered, and caspase\u2010dependent mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway in A549\u2010NQO1 and H596\u2010NQO1 cells, which was characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl\u2010xl ratio, MMP destruction, cytochrome c release, and subsequent caspase activation and PARP\u20101 cleavage.\n128\n Chiu et al. also found that tanshinone IIA induces the apoptosis of A549 cells by inducing the release of reactive oxygen species and decreasing the MMP.\n129\n LCD can induce apoptosis through the accumulation of ROS in lung cancer cells, increasing the loss of MMP and the upregulation or downregulation of mitochondrial\u2010related proteins, which leads to apoptotic cell death through the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway.\n41\n To amplify the therapeutic effect of EGCG, magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) encapsulated in bovine serum albumin (BSA) and loaded with EGCG were synthesized to induce apoptosis through the participation of ROS, resulting in the loss of MMP, increase in the expression of Nrf2 and Keap1, regulation of the apoptosis of A549 cells, and induction of EGCG to exert a more substantial anti\u2010lung cancer effect.\n130\n In A549 cells, artemisinin can significantly induce apoptosis through reactive oxygen species\u2010mediated amplification of the activation loop between caspase\u20103, caspase\u20108, and caspase\u20109.\n131\n Besides, Artesunate may play a cytotoxic role in A549 cells and normal HBE cells through ROS\u2010mediated DNA damage.\n60\n\n\n        \n        \n          3.1.2\n          Inductive endoplasmic reticulum stress\n          Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is a cellular response to protein misfolding, which has a far\u2010reaching influence on the survival and death of cancer cells. Its activation markers include ATF\u20106, CHOP, and ATF\u20104, BIP and XBP\u20101.\n132\n ERS plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. At the same time, the \u03b2\u2010elemene upregulates the expression levels of ER\u2010related proteins, such as ATF6, PERK, IRE\u03b1, ATF4, and CHOP, and downregulates the expression of Bcl\u20102, which inhibits lung cancer growth and cell viability in a dose\u2010dependent and time\u2010dependent manner.\n133\n Ginsenoside extract (TGS) can induce NSCLS cell autophagy by activating ERS, mediated by the ATF4\u2010CHOP\u2010AKT1\u2010mTOR axis of NSCLC cells.\n132\n\n\n          Lou et al. studied human lung adenocarcinoma PC9 cell lines and transplanted tumor models into nude mice and found that tanshinone showed sound anti\u2010lung cancer effects. Simultaneously, its mechanism of action was related to the promotion of apoptosis induced by ERS and the activation of the IRE1 \u03b1/caspase\u201012 apoptosis pathway.\n134\n The inhibitory effect of Tan IIA on the proliferation of H146 cells may be related to ERS, which is caused by the release of Ca2+ and the increased expression of GADD153, while the decrease in the expression of Bcl\u20102 leads to an increase of the Bax/Bcl\u20102 ratio, which in turn leads to a decrease in MMP and increased caspase\u20103 expression.\n125\n\n\n          LicA increases the expression levels of ERS related proteins, such as p\u2010EIF2 \u03b1 and ATF4, to inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells.\n135\n LicA also significantly promotes the expression of the tumor suppressor, miR\u2010144\u20103p, which upregulates the ER stress response protein, CHOP, and induces lung cancer cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of the nuclear factor E2\u2010related protein (Nrf2).\n136\n CHOP, which is known as a DNA damage\u2010inducing and growth arrest gene, is one of the most critical components of the ER stress network and its activation is essential for LicA\u2010induced apoptosis, cell viability, and autophagy.\n39\n LicA treatment induces ER stress activation, which leads to apoptotic cell death and exerts an anti\u2010tumor effect that significantly decreases the level of cisplatin\u2010induced renal damage but does not affect its anticancer effect.\n135\n GRP78 is the molecular chaperone of the ER that contributes to the correct folding of newborn peptides. When unfolded proteins accumulate, GRP78 triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which activates transcription factors such as XBP1 and CHOP, to restore stressed cell homeostasis. The increased expression of GRP78 and mild UPR may be present in cancer cells that promote cell survival and prevent apoptosis. Exposure to EGCG further increases GRP78 expression in the ER and induces XBP1, CHOP, and EDEM expression spliced by ATF4. It also decreases the expression of GRP78 on the cell surface and increases the activity of caspase\u20108 and caspase\u20103.\n137\n GRP78 and CHOP expression can also be detected in lung cancer cells treated with emodin, indicating that emodin can induce the apoptosis of lung cancer cells mediated by ERS.\n138\n (Figure\u00a01).\n          \n            FIGURE 1\n            \n              Natural extracts can induce apoptosis through ERS pathway and mitochondrial pathway. In this and below figures, the red thick line arrow indicates that the compound can increase the expression or activity of the corresponding protein, and the thick black line indicates that the compound can reduce the expression of the corresponding protein or inhibit the activity of the protein\n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          3.1.3\n          Induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway\n          Mitochondria play a significant role in the physiology of cancer cells. Most tumor cells are resistant to apoptosis and can be regarded as the primary regulators of cell life and death.\n117\n The most decisive event induced by the mitochondrial pathway during apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP), with MOMP being highly regulated by members of the BCL\u20102 protein family. This family can be categorized as pro\u2010apoptotic proteins (BAK and BAX), pro\u2010apoptotic BH3 protein (BIM, Noxa, BMF, BIK, PUMA, BID, HRK, and BAD) and anti\u2010apoptotic BCL\u20102 protein (BCL\u2010xL, BCL\u2010BA1, BCL\u20102, MCL\u20101, and BCL\u2010w). After MOMP, mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins (especially cytochrome c) are released into the cytoplasm, activating cystatin.\n139\n\n\n          The combination of ginsenoside and paclitaxel was found to have upregulated the expression of caspase\u20103 protein and downregulated the ratio of Bcl\u20102/Bax, which significantly increased the apoptosis\u2010inducing effect on A549 cells.\n140\n CK\u2010M exerts a good tumor targeting effect within 24 hours and maybe a suitable delivery agent to enhance the solubility and anti\u2010tumor effect of CK. TPGS/PEG\u2010PCL mixed micelle (CK\u2010M) promotes tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell metastasis, invasion, and efflux by regulating levels of Bax, Bcl\u20102, matrix metalloproteinase\u20102, P\u2010glycoprotein, caspase\u20103, and caspase\u20102.\n141\n The combination of curcumin and cisplatin significantly inhibited A549/DDP cell proliferation, reversed DDP resistance, and induced apoptosis by activating caspase\u20103, and promoting HIF\u20101\u03b1 degradation.\n142\n In addition, curcumin reduces Bcl\u20102 levels through ubiquitin\u2010proteasome degradation, making NSCLC cells sensitive to apoptosis.\n143\n \u03b2\u2010elemene increased the expression of Bax, decreased the expression of Bcl\u20102 and induced PARP cleavage, and enhanced apoptosis induced by \u03b2\u2010elemene.\n144\n The combination of \u03b2\u2010ELE and cisplatin decreased the protein levels of procaspase\u20103 and Bcl\u20102 in A549/DDP cells and increased the protein expression of caspase\u20103, cytochrome c, and Bad in A549/DDP cell lines, indicating that \u03b2\u2010ELE reversed the drug resistance of A549/DDP cells by inducing apoptosis.\n145\n\n\n          Tan IIA can also induce JNK signal activation and trigger cascade apoptosis mediated by cytochrome c release.\n146\n Tan IIA combined with cyclophosphamide (CTX) can regulate Bcl\u20102 and Bax expressions in lung cancer tissues of Lewis mice, inhibit the neovascularization of tumor tissue, enhance immune function, and exert evident anti\u2010tumor activity.\n147\n Li et al. found that emodin can inhibit the proliferation of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Anip\u2010973 by activating caspase\u20103 induced apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle.\n148\n It also enhanced the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by PTX and the anti\u2010tumor effect on A549 xenografts by increasing the expression of Bax and active cystatin\u20103 and decreasing levels of p\u2010Akt, Bcl\u20102, and p\u2010ERK, while there were no apparent side effects in vivo.\n44\n A549 cells expressing wild\u2010type p53 and H1299 cells with p53 deficiency could inhibit cell proliferation and increase the apoptosis rate when A549 cells were treated with berberine. A549 cells were more sensitive to berberine\u2010induced cytotoxicity. Apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells induced by berberine was related to the destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential, a decrease of Bcl\u20102 and Bcl\u2010xl levels, and the increase of Bax and Bak levels, as well as activation of caspase\u20103.\n149\n\n\n          Artesunate can induce apoptosis through the Bak\u2010mediated caspase\u2010independent intrinsic pathway in human NSCLC cells.\n150\n Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine, Artemisia annua, induced apoptosis of SPC\u2010A\u20101 cells by downregulating the expression of surviving at mRNA and protein levels, but did not affect caspase\u20104.\n151\n It was also able to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of ASTC\u2010a\u20101 cells through the caspase\u20103 dependent mitochondrial death pathway.\n152\n Methoxycinnamaldehyde (2\u2010MCA), a component of cinnamon bark, was also able to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, which was characterized by the upregulation of Bax and Bak genes and pro\u2010apoptotic and downregulation of Bcl\u20102, anti\u2010apoptotic and Bcl\u2010XL genes, the release of caspase\u20103, loss of MMP, cytochrome c and caspase\u20109 and their activation.\n153\n (Figure\u00a01).\n3.1.1\n          Inductive ROS\n          ROS is a natural by\u2010product of cell metabolism (mainly in the mitochondria).

Apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells induced by berberine was related to the destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential, a decrease of Bcl\u20102 and Bcl\u2010xl levels, and the increase of Bax and Bak levels, as well as activation of caspase\u20103.\n149\n\n\n          Artesunate can induce apoptosis through the Bak\u2010mediated caspase\u2010independent intrinsic pathway in human NSCLC cells.\n150\n Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine, Artemisia annua, induced apoptosis of SPC\u2010A\u20101 cells by downregulating the expression of surviving at mRNA and protein levels, but did not affect caspase\u20104.\n151\n It was also able to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of ASTC\u2010a\u20101 cells through the caspase\u20103 dependent mitochondrial death pathway.\n152\n Methoxycinnamaldehyde (2\u2010MCA), a component of cinnamon bark, was also able to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, which was characterized by the upregulation of Bax and Bak genes and pro\u2010apoptotic and downregulation of Bcl\u20102, anti\u2010apoptotic and Bcl\u2010XL genes, the release of caspase\u20103, loss of MMP, cytochrome c and caspase\u20109 and their activation.\n153\n (Figure\u00a01).\n3.2\n        Induction of autophagy\n        Autophagy is a biological process that is stimulated in response to various stresses (including hunger, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia, and DNA damage), in which membrane receptors receive signals transmitted to the cell,\n14\n and maintain balance in the body by capturing and degrading damaged proteins and organelles, which in turn is considered to promote an inhibitory effect on cancer cells.\n154\n\n\n        There are two types of autophagy: the first type, known as protective autophagy, protects against apoptosis, while the other is autophagic cell death, which induces the death of cancer cells. The GA\u2010induced autophagy of NCI\u2010H441 cells belongs to the latter type of autophagy and is mediated by ROS production.\n119\n Compared with tanshinone IIA, total tanshinone (TDT) showed more potent cytotoxic effects on 95D lung cancer cells, and apoptosis and protective autophagy induced by TDT were also mediated by an increase in intracellular ROS production.\n155\n When A549 cells were treated with cryptotanshinone (CTS), autophagic vesicles were found to have accumulated and the expression of LC3 protein and autophagosomes increased, proving that cryptotanshinone could exert its anti\u2010tumor effect by promoting autophagy.\n156\n Curcumin can induce autophagy by controlling hST8SiaI gene expression, related to the autophagy of A549 cells through the AMPK signaling pathway.\n157\n Wild\u2010type p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is important for cancer prevention. Emodin can target the accumulation of p53 protein in A549 cells and increase autophagy.\n158\n In addition, resveratrol is an activator of SIRT1 that induces protective autophagy in NSCLC by activating p38\u2010MAPK and inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway \n159\n to overcome gefitinib resistance through autophagy and aging.\n160\n\n\n        Many studies have shown that autophagy can enhance tumor resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiotherapy.\n161\n The inhibition of autophagy heightens the level of DNA damage induced by CPT in lung cancer cell lines, indicating that autophagy exerts a protective effect on lung cancer cells treated with CPT, and the combination of CPT and specific autophagy inhibitors can be considered as a promising therapeutic method for lung cancer in the future.\n14\n The inhibition of autophagy induced by Rg3 can increase the therapeutic response of etinib\u2010sensitive and etinib\u2010resistant NSCLC cells with EGFR\u2010activated mutations.\n162\n EGCG overcomes gefitinib (Gef) resistance by targeting ERK phosphorylation in NSCLC to inhibit autophagy and enhance cell death.\n163\n (Figure\u00a02).\n        \n          FIGURE 2\n          \n            Natural extracts exert inhibitory effects on lung cancer by inducing autophagy\n3.3\n        Inhibition of the PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway\n        It is well known that the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway is one of the most vital carcinogenic pathways in almost all cancers. The PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway has an essential effect on regulating cell survival, growth, apoptosis, and autophagy.\n164\n Activated Akt regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration by inhibiting a series of downstream substrates, such as caspase\u20109, GSK23, NF\u2010\u03baB, and Bad.\n165\n Therefore, the PI3\u00a0K\u2010AKT pathway seems to be one of the most promising targets for anticancer drugs.\n        Rad51 activity is related to tumorigenesis or tumor progression and may be a useful prognostic marker in NSCLC. Its high expression indicates a significant decrease in the survival rate. Astaxanthin downregulates Rad51 expression by inactivating AKT to enhance the mitomycin C\u2010induced cytotoxicity of human NSCLC cells.\n74\n PTEN negatively regulates the Akt signal pathway by degenerating PIP3 phosphate into PIP2. The PTEN gene is often mutated in many different types of cancers. A study observed that CTN treatment increased the upregulation of PTEN, while PTEN degraded PIP3, resulting in a decrease of Akt phosphorylation of Ser 473 and Thr 308. Akt inactivation reduces the degradation of p53, which ultimately leads to the increased expression of p21 and p53, and inhibition of tumor progression, indicating that tanshinone induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and inhibition of the PTEN\u2010mediated PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway for effectively inhibiting tumor growth.\n164\n PESV (peptides from BmK scorpion venom) can also increase the expression of PTEN in cultured A549 cells.\n86\n Epothilone B may enhance the apoptosis of human cancer cells induced by the Bcl\u20102 antagonist, ABT\u2010737, through the PI3\u00a0K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway.\n99\n EGCG can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of H1299 cells, which is relevant to the inhibition of the activation of the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway and downregulation of the expressions of p\u2010PI3\u00a0K and p\u2010Akt in lung cancer cells.\n165\n\n\n        Metastasis is a multi\u2010step process that involves the overexpression of proteolytic enzymes, such as urokinase\u2010type plasminogen activator (u\u2010PA) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), MMP or u\u2010PA gene expression, mainly at the transcriptional level (through the MAPK or PI3\u00a0K\u2010Akt pathway through AP\u20101 or NF\u2010\u03baB) and post\u2010transcriptional level, and it is regulated or inhibited by its activator at the protein level. Silybin can prevent Akt phosphorylation from inhibiting the PI3\u00a0K\u2010Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting lung cancer cell invasion.\n166\n In addition, Rg3 may also inhibit the apoptosis of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway.\n167\n\n\n        Extensive studies have shown that MDR cells can resist apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs by upregulating survival signaling pathways (including PI3\u00a0K and ERK1) or inhibiting antiproliferative signaling pathways, including the p38 MAPK. Triptolide promotes the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of drug\u2010resistant A549/Taxol cells by regulating the MAPK and PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathways.\n168\n The combination of triptolide and hydroxycamptothecin induces the apoptosis of human lung cancer cells by increasing PP2A activity, activating p38, ERK, and MAPK cascade reactions and by inhibiting the Akt survival pathway through mechanisms that involve PP2A activation, which synergistically enhances the effect of triptolide on A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.\n169\n\n\n        GA and cisplatin (CDDP) produced a synergistic growth inhibition effect on NCI\u2010H460 and A549 cells. GA treatment decreased the activation of Akt, mTOR, and S6, which may target autophagy\u2010dependent cell death by activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n170\n The combination of tanshinone IIA and cisplatin at a ratio of 20:1 can impair cell invasion and migration, block the cell cycle at the S phase, and induce the apoptosis of A549 and PC9 cells in a synergistic manner, probably due to the downregulation of the expression of the p\u2010Akt and p\u2010PI3\u00a0K proteins, which affect the PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway, as a result of the activity of tanshinone IIA.\n171\n The synergistic anti\u2010tumor activity of curcumin and carboplatin is due to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation that inhibits the Akt/IKK\u03b1 pathway and enhancement of ERK1/2 activity to inhibit NF\u2010\u03baB, allowing carboplatin to act as a chemical sensitizer.\n172\n Wang et al. demonstrated that Tan IIA enhanced NSCLC cell sensitivity to gefitinib by downregulating the VEGFR2/Akt pathway (downregulating the phosphorylation levels of VEGFR2 and Akt) in vivo and in vitro.\n173\n\n\n        XRCC1 is a major scaffolding protein involved in base excision repair. It is regulated by ERK1/2 and AKT signaling and is significantly involved in lung cancer development. Resveratrol enhances the etoposide\u2010induced cytotoxicity of human NSCLC cells by downregulating ERK1/2 and AKT\u2010mediated XRCC1 protein expression.\n174\n In NCI\u2010H1975 cells treated with DHA and gefitinib, the expression of pMIT and p\u2010STAT3 was significantly downregulated, indicating that both of them synergistically inhibit the growth and promote the apoptosis of NSCLC cells through the Akt/mTOR/STAT3 pathway.\n175\n (Figure\u00a03).\n        \n          FIGURE 3\n          \n            Natural extracts exert inhibitory effects on PI3\u00a0K/Akt signaling pathway\n3.4\n        Inhibition of the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway\n        There is considerable evidence that NF\u2010\u03baB is constitutively activated in many types of solid tumors, including cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.\n176\n NF\u2010\u03baB exerts its role by activating various downstream signal transduction cascades, such as the TNF\u2010\u03b1, BCL\u20102, and STAT 3 pathways. Previous studies have shown that increased expression of NF\u2010\u03baB can be detected in NSCLC tissues and acts as a tumor promoter in NSCLC. In addition, the overexpression of NF\u2010\u03baB is related to cancer cell metastasis and the poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC.\n177\n\n\n        Epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is an essential factor during the metastasis of bronchogenic carcinoma. Rg3 inhibits EMT and the invasive ability of lung cancer by downregulating EGFR inactivation mediated by FUT4 and blocking the MAPK and NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathways.\n178\n Saponin Rg3 + cisplatin can inhibit hypoxia\u2010induced EMT and cancer cell stemness due to the inactivation of the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway caused by Rg3.\n13\n Extracellular ATP performs many significant functions by activating P2 receptors on the cell surface. Emodin inhibits ATP\u2010induced EMT, migration, and proliferation by inhibiting the P2Y receptor\u2010mediated increase of Ca2+ and NF\u2010\u03baB signal transduction in A549 cells.\n179\n GA inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB signal transduction, in turn inhibiting the EMT process induced by TGF\u2010\u03b21 through the inhibition of the expression of TWIST1, which leads to inhibition of lung growth and metastasis of A549 cells.\n180\n\n\n        Programmed death ligand 1 (PD\u2010L1) is highly expressed on the surface of a variety of human cancer cells, such as malignant melanoma, NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. It has been confirmed that it is involved in the chemotherapeutic resistance of NSCLC. PD\u2010L1 is a new target for the treatment of lung cancer cells. Rk1 inhibits PD\u2010L1 expression and promotes apoptosis by inhibiting NF\u2010\u03ba B signal transduction. Thus, it inhibits the proliferation of A549 and PC9 cells.\n181\n Rg3 can inhibit the growth of A549/DDP cells and reduce their resistance to cisplatin by preventing the expression of NF\u2010\u03baB from decreasing the expression of PD\u2010L1 induced by chemical resistance and restoring the cytotoxicity of T cells toward cancer cells.\n182\n\n\n        Low concentrations of triptolide may bind to high\u2010affinity targets to activate p38\u03b1 and ERK1/2, and block the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB induced by TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101 \u03b2 through p53.\n183\n Luteinic acid and its analogs inhibit IKK\u03b2 kinase activity by inhibiting the activation of the TNF\u03b1/NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, which in turn induces apoptosis in A549 and U251 cells.\n184\n DHA can inhibit lung cancer cell metastasis by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB/GLUT1 axis.\n185\n The inhibitory effect of silybin on lung tumor growth can also be achieved through the regulation of macrophage\u2010associated cytokines, NF\u2010\u03baB, as well as signal transduction and transcriptional activators on angiogenesis.\n186\n BV can induce apoptosis of A549 and NCI\u2010H460 cells by increasing the expression of death receptor 3 (DR3) and inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. BV combined with the TNF\u2010like weak apoptosis inducer, docetaxel, and cisplatin can synergistically inhibit the growth of A549 and NCI\u2010H460 cells further to downregulate the activity of NF\u2010\u03baB.\n187\n\n\n        The resveratrol targeting NF\u2010\u03baB (p65) pathway can decrease TRAIL drug resistance, sanitizing lung cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL, and allowing the induction of TRAIL\u2010mediated apoptosis.\n60\n TPL also inhibits the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB by blocking the transactivation of p65, sanitizing A549, and NCI\u2010H1299 cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL.\n188\n It can also reverse the paclitaxel resistance of lung cancer by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway and regulating the transcription and expression of drug resistance genes.\n189\n Ginsenoside Rg3 can inhibit the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, the phosphorylation of I\u03baB protein and the expression of NF\u2010\u03baB regulated gene products (promotes apoptosis, cyclin\u2010D1, cyclin\u20102, cyclooxygenase\u20102, and VEGF) by targeting the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, sensitizing human NSCLC cells to \u03b3 radiation.\n190\n The synergistic anti\u2010tumor activity of curcumin and carboplatin is due to the inhibition of the Akt/IKK\u03b1 pathway and the enhancement of ERK1/2 activity that inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB for carboplatin to act as a chemical sensitizer.\n172\n GA and ADM (Adriamycin) exert a potent anti\u2010tumor effect on the A549 xenograft model by inhibiting P\u2010glycoprotein and NF\u2010\u03baB, attenuating ADM\u2010induced cardiotoxicity, and sensitizing lung cancer cells to ADM.\n191\n (Figure\u00a04).\n        \n          FIGURE 4\n          \n            Natural extracts block NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway\n3.5\n        The arrest of the cell cycle\n        The regular process of cell division occurs through the cell cycle, which is a sequence of highly ordered steps, which are usually divided into G0/G1, S, G2, and M phases. These steps are regulated at the molecular level by several regulators, including cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin\u2010D, and CDK inhibitor (CKI).\n192\n, \n193\n In recent years, studies have found that normal cells proliferate only in response to specific mitotic signals and growth stimuli, while cancer cells proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. In addition, almost all molecular types involved in the regulation of cell proliferation are involved in malignant transformation. Therefore, cancer can be regarded as a cell cycle disease.\n194\n\n\n        Myc expression is strictly controlled by the availability of mitogens in normal cells but is usually misregulated or elevated in tumor cells.\n195\n Emodin can downregulate the C\u2010myc gene expression to induce cell cycle arrest and induce growth inhibition of A549 cells.\n47\n TPL inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by nucleolus decomposition and rRNA synthesis inhibition (possibly through the ribosomal\u2010RPL23\u2010MDM2\u2010p53 signaling pathway).\n196\n BBR inhibits AP\u20101 signaling pathway activity and reduces the binding of transcription factors to the CCND1 AP\u20101 motifs, which is an essential mechanism for the action of berberine as a cyclin\u2010D1 regulator against human lung giant cell carcinoma.\n197\n Low concentrations of ART inhibit mRNA levels of cyclin\u2010related genes, including CDK2, CDK1, cyclin\u2010D1, CDK6, cyclin\u2010B1, and cyclin\u2010A2, which lead to cell cycle arrest of NSCLC cells.\n198\n Silybin inhibits human NSCLC cell growth by regulating the expression and function of key cell cycle regulators, reducing the protein levels of G1\u2010related CDK\n2\n, \n4\n, \n6\n and their corresponding cyclins\u2010D1 and D3, and inducing arrest of the cell cycle at G1.\n199\n The combination of silybin and indole\u20103\u2010methanol (I3C) also enhanced the inhibitory effect of lung adenocarcinoma in A/J mice,\n65\n mainly by inhibiting the inflammatory drive by regulating key cell cycle regulatory factors and reducing the level of cyclin\u2010D1 and related proteins.\n200\n The Rb gene plays an essential role in regulating tumor cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis. The Rb gene was found to be activated by a low concentration of mitomycin C enhanced the inhibition of proliferation, significantly increased the number of cells at the G1/G0 phase and decreased the number of cells at the S and G2/M phases, indicating that the inhibitory effect of mitomycin C on A549 cells is induced mainly through cell cycle arrest.\n101\n\n\n        Ginsenoside Rh2 can activate the JNK/MAPK signaling pathway, increase the transcriptional and phosphorylation activity of transcription factors(ATF2 and AP\u20101), reduce the expression of transcription factors(C\u2010myc and E2F1), and affect the expression of CDK4 and cyclin\u2010D1, which are the critical regulators of G1/S cyclin\u2010dependent kinases.\n201\n Saha also found that curcumin can induce the expression of cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitors, p27 and p21, and inhibit the expression of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin\u2010D1, CDK6, and other genes, to block the cell cycle in the G1/S phase and inhibit the growth of PC\u20109 cells.\n202\n Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is associated with the development of many types of cancers and tumors, especially lung cancer. PRMT5 promotes the apoptosis of lung cancer cells through Akt/Gsk3\u03b2 signaling induced by resveratrol. Further studies have shown that the inhibition or downregulation of PRMT5 further reduces the phosphorylation of Akt/GSK3\u03b2 and the expressions of cyclins\u2010D1 and E1 among the downstream target cells treated with resveratrol.\n203\n This induces cell cycle arrest at the G0 / G1 phase in lung cancer cells.\n204\n UCN\u201001 (7\u2010hydroxystaurosporine) can inhibit CDKs and inhibit cell cycle progression of A549 cells from G1 to the S phase.\n205\n\n\n        GA was found to have induced the apoptosis of A549 cells in a time and dose\u2010dependent manner arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase in vitro, and downregulated the mRNA expression of cyclin\u2010D1 and COX\u20102, suggesting that GA could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells through apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest.\n206\n Both tanshinone nano\u2010emulsion and extract could penetrate the cytoplasm through endocytosis, which could induce the upregulation of p53 and p21 and downregulation of CDK2, cyclin\u2010E1, and cyclin\u2010D1. At the same time, the cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 phase, and tanshinone nano\u2010emulsion was found to have inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells more effectively than tanshinone extract.\n207\n Dihydroartemisinin exerts apparent anticancer activity on A549 cells, which is related to G0 and G1 phase arrest.\n208\n DHA treatment of A549 cells led to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, which was related to the downregulation of PCNA and cyclin\u2010D1 at mRNA and protein levels.\n209\n DHA induces potent cytotoxicity and radiosensitivity on GLC\u201082 cells. The mechanism of action may proceed by preventing the growth of GLC\u201082 cells at the G0/G1 phase, reducing the proportion of cells at the S phase, restoring p53 function, reducing the expression of Bcl\u20102 protein, and inducing GLC apoptosis.\n210\n Melittin was found to have induced G1 cell cycle arrest of Chago\u2010K1 human bronchial cancer cells.\n211\n\n\n        Tan IIA may block the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway, indirectly induce S\u2010phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibit the downstream signaling pathway, and subsequently upregulate the expression of apoptosis\u2010promoting genes and downregulate the expression of anti\u2010apoptosis genes, and finally inhibit the growth and proliferation of A549 cells.\n212\n Tan1 inhibits the growth and angiogenesis of lung carcinoma cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner by inhibiting the expression of cyclin\u2010A, VEGF, and cyclin\u2010B proteins, inducing a stronger effect than Tan2. This anti\u2010tumor effect may slow down the progression of cells through the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.\n213\n When lung cancer cells were treated with a nano\u2010emulsion of curcumin extract, it was found that H460 cells were more prone to apoptosis than A549 cells and that the cell cycle remained in the G2/M phase, accompanied by a dose\u2010dependent decrease in CDK1 expression.\n214\n LCA and LCD significantly decreased the expression of cyclins\u2010B1 and cdc2 in lung cancer cells, and their complexes participated in the G2/M phase transition, which is that G2/M cell cycle arrest could inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells.\n36\n, \n41\n Artesunate can increase the production of NO to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, which is relevant to the downregulation of cyclin\u2010B1 mRNA expression and improves the radiosensitivity of human NSCLC A549 cells.\n215\n ET\u2010743 induces the characteristics of medium cell line\u2010dependent radiosensitization in A549 cells, and the radiosensitization may be caused by G2/M phase arrest.\n111\n (Figure\u00a05).\n        \n          FIGURE 5\n          \n            Natural extracts can induce cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells\n3.6\n        Regulation of epigenetics\n        Few studies have shown that epigenetics plays a crucial part in the development of lung cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modification, DNA methylation, chromatin tissue, and non\u2010coding RNA, are hereditary and reversible. Many genes are silenced or uncontrolled during the carcinogenesis of lung cancer.\n216\n\n\n        MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non\u2010coding RNA of a length of 18\u201325 nucleotides, which are expressed in all cells. Their abnormal expression leads to an abnormal protein function, which leads to NSCLC tumorigenesis. Tumor tissue factor (TF) contributes to cancer metastasis in some NSCLC patients. BBR inhibits NSCLC cell growth and promotes apoptosis through the miR\u201019a/TF/MAPK signaling pathway.\n217\n Mir\u2010491 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can inhibit hypoxia\u2010induced migration, while Rh2 can exert anti\u2010metastatic activity on the hypoxic tumor microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma cells by increasing the expression of mir\u2010491.\n218\n MiR\u2010301a\u20103p is a miRNA that has been suggested to exert carcinogenic effects on many types of cancers. \u03b2\u2010elemene may weaken the Warburg effect in NSCLC cells by mediating the miR\u2010301a\u20103p/AMPK\u03b1 axis by inhibiting the expression of miR\u2010301a\u20103p in NSCLC cells and increasing the expression of AMPK\u03b1.\n219\n In addition, \u03b2\u2010elemene increases IGFBP1 gene expression through Stat3 inactivation and then produces a mutual effect between miRNA155\u20105p and FOXO3a, which leads to the inhibition of the growth of lung cancer cells.\n220\n Melittin activates caspase\u20102 (CASP2) to induce lung carcinoma cell apoptosis by inhibiting miR\u2010183 expression.\n221\n\n\n        AURKA is a carcinogenic gene that encodes for serine\u2010threonine kinase and regulates mitosis in mammalian cells. Tanshinone can inhibit AURKA, by upregulating the expression of miR\u201032 and other related miRNAs to inhibit NSCLC.\n222\n LICA was found to have reversed the expression of ectopic miRNAs induced by NNK, including miR\u2010328\u20103p, let\u20107d\u20103p, miR\u201029c\u20103p, miR\u201020a\u20105p, and miR\u2010144\u20103p, to stimulate chemoprophylaxis in vivo and in vitro.\n223\n Triptolide decreases proliferation and enhances NSCLC cell apoptosis by targeting miR\u201021 to enhance the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN).\n224\n HOTAIR is an important carcinogenic lncRNA that is involved in invasion and tumorigenesis, while miR\u201034a\u20105p plays a role in tumor suppression. The combination of BBR and gefitinib may control the growth and metastasis of NSCLC through miR\u201034a\u20105p and HOTAIR\u2010mediated EMT inhibition.\n225\n\n\n        Zhang et al. first proved that curcumin exerts anticancer effects on A549/DDP multidrug\u2010resistant cells, which changes miRNA expression, primarily by reducing the expression of miR\u2010186.\n226\n Curcumin can improve the sensitivity of paclitaxel\u2010resistant NSCLC cells to paclitaxel through microRNA\u201030c\u2010mediated MTA1 reduction.\n227\n Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the leading cause of tumor metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapeutic resistance. In serum samples of NSCLC patients, hsa\u2010mir\u2010485\u20105p expression was found to have decreased, while RXR\u03b1 (a nuclear receptor) expression was found to have increased in NSCLC. The upregulation or activation of RXR\u03b1 enhanced the CSC\u2010like characteristics of NSCLC cells. EGCG can inhibit CSC\u2010like characteristics by regulating the hsa\u2010mir\u2010485\u20105p/RXR\u03b1 axis.\n228\n The overexpression of miR\u2010485 could reduce the stemness of A549/DDP cells, while EGCG could inhibit stemness by increasing the expression of miR\u2010485 in A549/CDDP cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner.\n229\n The miRNA spectrum analysis shows that the upregulation of Myb by EGCG can be realized by the downregulation of miRNA, mmu\u2010miR\u2010449c\u20105p induced by EGCG.\n230\n Using next\u2010generation sequencing technology, KEGG analysis, and the PANTHER pathway showed that the MAPK pathway is the most effective targeting pathway for EGCG\u2010regulated microRNAs.\n55\n\n\n        As an oncogene, the novel long non\u2010coding RNA, AK001796, is concerned with cell growth inhibition induced by resveratrol in lung cancer. Microarray analysis has shown that AK001796 was the most apparent long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA), and that it is overexpressed in lung cancer cells, but that its expression was downregulated in lung cancer cells treated with resveratrol, and that the decrease of the lncRNA AK001796 level may weaken the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on cell proliferation.\n231\n Silybin can also reverse the drug resistance of human SCLC cells,\n232\n downregulate the expression of miR\u201021, and promote the re\u2010expression of miR\u2010200c in erlotinib refractory tumors, as well as inhibit EMT\u2010driven erlotinib resistance.\n233\n\n\n        Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are epigenetic enzymes that control gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylation transcription. BBR inhibits HDAC\u2010mediated epigenetic reprogramming, which may be a key mechanism of its anti\u2010tumor activity.\n234\n Mirzaaghaei et al. found that the combination of EGCG and silybin can regulate the expression of pro\u2010angiogenic miRNAs in endothelial cells with tumor cells.\n235\n It can also coordinate with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors to upregulate E\u2010cadherin expression and inhibit the migration and invasion of human NSCLC cells.\n236\n Am80 is a synthetic vitamin A, which has been used as a new drug in patients with relapsed and stubborn acute promyelocytic leukemia. EGCG binds to Am80 by downregulating the level of non\u2010histone acetylation by downregulating HDAC\u20104, HDAC\u20105, and HDAC\u20106, and stimulating the apoptosis of human lung carcinoma cells.\n237\n Berberine can inhibit N\u2010acetyltransferase activity in A549 cells and was found to show a negative correlation between dose and time to some extent, which may be one of the mechanisms of its anti\u2010tumor effect.\n238\n Resveratrol epigenetically regulates the expression of zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) in NSCLC cells. ZFP36 is an AU\u2010rich essential protein that binds to the 3\u2019\u2010untranslated region and promotes the decay of target mRNAs. The downregulation of ZFP36 expression leads to the stability of the target mRNAs.\n239\n SirT1 is a conservative NAD+\u2010dependent deacetylase, which participates in the regulation of stress response and cell survival, and seems to play an essential role in developing cancer resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and tumorigenesis. Its expression is negatively correlated with radiosensitivity. Resveratrol regulates the apoptosis and radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells through the Sirt1/NF\u2010\u03baB/Smac pathway.\n240\n RHBDD1, a mammalian member of the rhomboid family of proteins, is a highly conserved intramembranous serine protease. Silencing of RHBDD1 can inhibit cell proliferation and growth in glioblastoma, colorectal, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Silybin inhibits the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transformation of NSCLC cells by inhibiting RHBDD1 and exerts anti\u2010tumor effects on NSCLC cells.\n241\n Reverse inducible cysteine\u2010rich protein with Kazal motif (RECK) is a membrane\u2010anchored glycoprotein that negatively regulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and plays an integral role in cancer invasion and metastasis. GA inhibits experimental lung metastasis and cell invasion of A549 in a dose\u2010dependent manner, which is attributed to the fact that GA effectively inhibits the binding of histone deacetylase (HDAC)\u20101/specific protein(Sp)\u20101, and Sp1 phosphorylation is related to extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction, resulting in the upregulation of RECK at mRNA and protein levels.\n242\n In A549 cells and A549 xenografted mice, GA inhibits cell invasion and migration through a reverse\u2010induced cysteine\u2010rich protein upregulated by the kazal motif (RECK).\n243\n3.7\n        Regulation of other mechanisms and the combined effect of multiple mechanisms\n        The HA\u2010CD44/RHAMM signaling pathway plays an integral role in the growth and survival of NSCLC cells. The low concentration of triptolide significantly decreased NSCLC cell growth and inhibited tumor growth in mice by targeting the HA\u2010CD44/RHAMM signaling axis.\n244\n The Nrf2/HO\u20101 signal pathway is thought to mediate cell resistance to EGCG. Metformin sensitizes NSCLC cells to EGCG by inhibiting the Nrf2/HO\u20101 signaling pathway.\n53\n Ginsenoside Rh2 induced A549 cell apoptosis through the Ras/Raf/ERK/p53 pathway.\n245\n GA can also inhibit the viability of NSCLC cells by inducing apoptosis by inhibiting the Notch signal pathway.\n246\n Tanshinone IIA increases TRAIL\u2010induced NSCLC cell death by selectively activating PERK/ATF4 and inhibiting the STAT3\u2010mediated upregulation of DR5 and downregulation of Survivin.\n247\n TPL also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, inhibited the transport of STAT3 into the nucleus, and reduced the expression of STAT3 target genes associated with apoptosis, migration, and cell survival, such as C\u2010myc, myeloid leukemia 1 (MCL\u20101), BCL2, and matrix metallopeptidase\u20109 (MMP\u20109), thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and migration and inducing cell apoptosis.\n248\n\n\n        Melittin significantly inhibited the secretion of VEGF in NSCLC cells. In addition, melittin can also reduce the protein expression of VEGF and HIF\u20101\u03b1. Therefore, the anti\u2010tumor activity of melittin may be relevant to the inhibition of the anti\u2010angiogenesis of VEGF and the hypoxia\u2010inducible factor signaling pathway.\n249\n Emodin enhances cisplatin\u2010induced cytotoxicity by downregulating ERCC1 and inactivating ERK1/2.\n250\n \u03b2\u2010elemene is a prospective drug to enhance tumor radiation response. Survivin and HIF\u20101\u03b1 are newly identified targets of \u03b2\u2010elemene.\n251\n \u03b2\u2010elemene at a radiosensitizing dose could also significantly downregulate mTOR mRNA expression, HIF\u20101a, and Survivin mRNA.\n252\n Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) play an essential role in translation initiation. Curcumin can block protein synthesis initiation by regulating eIF2a and eIF4E expressions, thus decreasing cell viability.\n253\n\n\n        Tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) play a vital part in regulating the cancer microenvironment and promoting tumor metastasis. It has two subsets: the classical subtype of activated macrophages (M1) and the alternative subtype of activated macrophages (M2). Subtype M2 macrophages stimulate a more aggressive phenotype of lung cancer cells. G\u2010Rh2 can convert TAM from the M2 subclass to that of M1 and prevent lung cancer cell migration.\n254\n CUR can induce the cell death of ASTC\u2010a\u20101 cells in a significant apoptotic manner through a caspase\u2010independent mitochondrial pathway.\n25\n As a protein with a short half\u2010life, Mcl\u20101 abundance is strictly regulated at many levels, including transcriptional, transcriptional, and post\u2010translational levels Tan IIA can be used as an EGFR signal inhibitor that targets the EGFR\u2010Akt\u2010Mcl1 axis, shortening the Mcl\u20101 half\u2010life and promoting its ubiquitination, which can provide new options for NSCLC therapy.\n255\n\n\n        Silybin can target multiple cytokine\u2010induced signaling pathways, downregulate the expression of iNOS in NSCLC cells,\n256\n and regulate the expression of iNOS and cyclooxygenase 2(COX2) in lung epithelial LM2 cells of tumorigenic mice by regulating the signals mediated by TNF\u2010\u03b1 and interferon\u2010\u03b3.\n257\n Nitric oxide (NO) signaling plays a significant role in cancer angiogenesis and is positively correlated with the occurrence and development of lung cancer. Silybin exerts most of its chemopreventive effects and vascular prophylaxis roles by inhibiting the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) \n258\n and COX\u20102 in lung tumors. These two enzymes promote the growth and progression of lung tumors by inducing VEGF expression.\n66\n The overexpression of COX\u20102 is usually associated with human NSCLC and participates in tumor invasion, angiogenesis, proliferation, and anti\u2010apoptosis. Triptolide inhibits COX\u20102 expression through COX\u20102 mRNA stability regulation and post\u2010transcriptional regulation.\n259\n Resveratrol can enhance the anticancer effect of paclitaxel on NSCLC cells in vitro by reducing COX\u20102 expression at mRNA and protein levels, indicating that resveratrol has the potential to be used as a promising sensitizer for PA.\n260\n4\n      DILEMMAS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS\n      Although compounds from microorganisms, marine organisms, plants, and animals are often used to treat cancer in clinical practice, they are often limited by specific inherent characteristics. For example, CPT, curcumin, GA, tanshinone, TPL, EGCG, resveratrol, artemisinin, and other compounds have poor water solubility, low biocompatibility, low oral bioavailability, instability, and poor pharmacokinetic properties, which hinder their clinical application.\n21\n, \n130\n, \n204\n, \n261\n, \n262\n, \n263\n, \n264\n, \n265\n In addition, the yield of natural separation from natural products is low.\n106\n\n\n      More importantly, the use of these natural compounds often produces severe side effects. For example, side effects of camptothecin include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, and hair loss.\n21\n Adriamycin use may result in serious adverse events, especially myelosuppression, leading to severe neutropenia, cardiotoxicity, and septicemia.\n90\n The side effects of mitomycin include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, rash, fever, and general discomfort, while rare but potentially severe adverse events include hemolytic uremic syndrome, hemolysis, neurological abnormalities, renal failure, and interstitial pneumonia.\n21\n Excessive cytotoxicity causes some of the side effects of EbB, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and sensory neuropathy.\n98\n, \n100\n The clinical application of TPL is usually limited by its severe toxicity.\n263\n Intravenous injection of BBR solution can lead to fatal adverse cardiovascular effects.\n266\n\n\n      Active efforts are being made to improve therapeutic effectiveness further using drug delivery strategies that extend the exposure time of the drug to the tumor, such as through structural modification and innovative preparation methods, alternative parenteral dosage forms, and administration regimens to improve oral bioavailability.\n20\n, \n204\n, \n263\n, \n265\n, \n267\n An effective combination of conventional chemotherapy agents based on nanotechnology can be used to achieve effective treatment of tumors with low toxic side effects. Research in this field has gained importance for the development of cancer treatments and their clinical application. The main advantages of nanodrugs are as follows: (a) improve the water biocompatibility and solubility of drugs; (b) surface\u2010modified nanoparticles prolong the tolerance time of anticancer drugs in vivo; (c) the precise accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs with payload in the body through localization strategies; (d) stimulus\u2010response release; (e) reduction of toxic and side effects on normal cells and tissues.\n261\n\n\n      In NSCLC cells and Swiss albino mice, gelatin nanoparticles (GNP) loaded with resveratrol (RSV) exert a higher anticancer effect than free RSV. RSV\u2010GNPs synergistically inhibit cell cycle progression and constitutive NF\u2010kB activation, and induce the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. GNP has a high loading efficiency and superior efficacy in NCI\u2010H460 cells, making it an ideal method of transferring RSV.\n268\n Gelatin (GEL) or hyaluronic acid (HA) nanoparticles aggregated through dihydroartemisinin showed higher anticancer proliferation activity than natural DHA in A549 cells, which may be because hydrophilic GEL or HA nanoparticles have greater water dispersion ability after aggregation, which can be used to increase the therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs.\n269\n The magnetic nanoparticles PLGA\u2010PEG\u2010Fe3O4 loaded with silybin can also effectively inhibit the expression of the hTERT gene and the proliferation of lung cancer cells.\n270\n Organic/inorganic composed of berberine (BER), hydride nanoparticles (NPs), and zinc oxide (ZnO), have been developed for the therapy of lung cancer. These NPs can improve the antiproliferative effect based on the efficacy of chemical photothermal therapy, and do not cause severe hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and blood toxicity, as shown in blood tests conducted on rats after intravenous administration.\n271\n In addition, transferrin (Tf) receptors are usually overexpressed in cancer cells. Artemisinin and its analogs enhance cancer cell delivery through human serum transferrin adducts and exert distinct anticancer effects on tumors with few side effects on normal cells.\n272\n\n\n      Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an enzyme expressed on the surface of lung cancer cells, but its expression in normal lung cells is limited. The anti\u2010CAIX antibody coupled with liposome has the characteristics of uniform particle size distribution and continuous release, which can significantly increase the uptake of cells and tumor spheres, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of TPL in CAIX positive cancer cells. Anti\u2010CAIX antibody modified liposome TPL delivered through the lung not only inhibited tumor growth more effectively than other non\u2010targeted TPL preparations. And the survival time of mice with orthotopic lung tumors was prolonged to the greatest possible extent.\n273\n Polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified long cycle BBR liposomes showed a uniform morphology, storage stability and continuous release behavior in vitro, and the liposome form led to a significant increase in circulatory retention of BBR compared with the solution. In tumor\u2010bearing mice, BBR liposomes selectively increased the concentration of BBR in the spleen, lung, liver and tumors, while distribution in the kidney and heart was at a lower level. Long\u2010term administration of BBR liposomes has been proven to be effective and safe in inhibiting tumor growth in nude mice.\n266\n\n\n      Nano\u2010polymer\u2010drug coupling has many significant advantages. The combination of natural products and other drugs may exert a more significant anticancer effect on lung cancer. Hyaluronic acid/actoferrin multilayer\u2010coated lipid nanoparticles can deliver rapamycin and berberine to lung cancer cells. In vivo studies on tumor\u2010bearing mice have shown that their therapeutic activity is better than free drugs.\n274\n Liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNP), as an effective carrier for co\u2010delivery of pemetrexed (PMX) and resveratrol (RSV), can effectively be used to treat lung cancer. PMX\u2010RSV\u2010LCNPs inhibit tumor growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, and has little toxicity on the liver and kidney, thus allowing its broad applicability for lung cancer.\n275\n In addition, local delivery of BBR and rapamycin (RAP) to tumor cells through inhalable multi\u2010compartment nanocomposites also has broad applicability for the treatment of lung cancer.\n276\n\n\n      In addition to the application of new preparations, triptolide derivatives have recently been developed to optimize bioavailability and reduce toxicity. MRx102 (MyeloRx, Vallejo, CA) significantly reduces the activation of the cell proliferation, Wnt pathway, migration, and invasion of H460 and A549 cells. Moreover, tumor metastasis and formation were found to have been inhibited in the patient\u2010derived xenograft NSCLC mouse model. In short, MRx102 is an effective antineoplastic drug for the treatment of lung cancer.\n277\n The anti\u2010tumor effect of berberine (BBR) derivative 8\u2010cetylberberine (HBBR) was significantly higher, compared with BBR in terms of hydrophobicity and pharmacology. Low\u2010dose HBBR could interfere with the expression of cyclin\u2010D1 and E1 to induce G1 cycle arrest and induce caspase pathway to increase apoptosis, and may inhibit the PI3\u00a0K/Akt pathway in A549 cells, thus significantly inhibiting tumor growth.\n278\n 8\u2010acetyl tyrosine (CCOP), a new derivative of Coptis chinensis, induced mitochondrial\u2010dependent apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells. 10\u00a0mg/kg significantly delayed tumor growth in A549 xenografted nude mice, which was more efficient than that of 100\u00a0mg/kg Coptis chinensis.\n279\n\n\n      Silybin meglumine, a water\u2010soluble form of silymarin that can prevent EGFR mutated NSCLC cell EMT, can also prevent the regeneration of tumors that do not respond to gefitinib, thus preventing severe tumor growth.\n280\n Resveratrol is quickly acidified and sulfated by glucuronide after it is removed by the human body.\n264\n Intranasal administration of concentrated preparations is an effective method of exposing the lungs to sufficient quantity of resveratrol.\n281\n\n\n      In short, the above schemes can improve the application of these natural ingredients to a certain extent, because most of the studies have only been conducted on plant\u2010derived compounds. The valuable experience gained from these plant\u2010derived compounds may be applied to animal toxins, microorganisms, and marine organisms, especially animal toxins, which often cause severe or even irreversible damage to normal human tissues because of their aggressive properties. In addition to the defects of these chemical products themselves, another limitation to their application is their high price. For example, the price of Epothilone is relatively high, and the synthesis of the drug poses great challenges.\n97\n The whole process of introducing new drugs to the market involves discovery, preclinical studies, clinical experiments, regulatory approval, and initiation.\n120\n This is a time\u2010consuming and expensive process that can take 10 to 15\u00a0years, while natural compounds are difficult to produce commercially as they are often complex and extensive. This makes the optimization of drug candidates and commercial production very cumbersome and expensive.\n86\n To ameliorate this dilemma, firstly, the demand from companies in developing countries should be stimulated, and secondly, the provision of knowledge by universities and research institutes should be increased, particularly by encouraging partnerships between universities and the pharmaceutical industry.\n282\n5\n      CONCLUSION\n      The natural active extracts described in this article renew hope for the treatment of lung cancer. These compounds can inhibit the growth, proliferation, and invasion of lung cancer cells by regulating various signaling pathways to promote apoptosis, enhance autophagy, and block the cell cycle. They can work in combination with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy to enhance their anticancer effects, and significantly, they can also reverse drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, which is exciting because the emergence of chemotherapeutic drug resistance increases the prevalence of cancer cells and brings more significant challenges for the treatment of cancer. However, these active ingredients have some disadvantages, such as low bioavailability, poor stability, and poor water solubility, which limit their clinical application, while opening a promising and novel research field to help increase the uptake and efficacy of these drugs, especially the application and development of nanotechnology. In summary, these findings indicate that natural product\u2010derived drugs are promising potential anticancer therapies worthy of further study to better understand the mechanisms by which they induce their anticancer effects.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n      The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\n      Tingting Wen: Writing\u2010Original draft,creating\u00a0images.
