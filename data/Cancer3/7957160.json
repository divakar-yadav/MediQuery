    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      The number of deaths due to cancer accounts for about 12% of the total deaths each year worldwide, and there are over 1\u00a0000\u00a0000 new cases of cancer per year.\n1\n Lung cancer has become the leading cause of cancer deaths in humans. Xuanwei area in Yunnan province, including Xuanwei, Fuyuan, Qilin and Zhanyi Counties (E 103\u00b035\u203230\u2033 to 104\u00b040\u203250\u2033, N 25\u00b053\u203250\u2033 to 26\u00b044\u203250\u2033), located in south\u2010western China, has a population of about 1.4\u00a0million, and its incidence of lung cancer is among the highest in the world. Especially, the incidence of lung cancer among non\u2010smokers is 400/100\u00a0000, which is 20 times higher than the national average.\n2\n, \n3\n Previous studies have associated this excessive incidence of lung cancer with the domestic combustion of \u2018smoky coal\u2019, especially burning the coals in unvented households.\n4\n, \n5\n The smoky coal typically means the locally obtainable Late Permian bituminous coal,\n6\n which releases high level of visible smoke upon combustion. This kind of coal is available from many local coal mines within Xuanwei region and constitutes the primary fuel source for native residents. Several researches have proposed that the smoky coal combustion products like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and air pollution fine\u2010grained matter such as crystalline quartz particulate are classified as mutagens to human cancer.\n7\n, \n8\n The Yunnan Provincial Government has carried out furnace and stove reform work in Xuanwei area, hoping to reduce the incidence of lung cancer by reducing indoor coal\u2010burning air pollution. However, the results of the Third National Sampling Survey of Cause of Death showed that the lung cancer mortality rate in the whole Xuanwei area increased most significantly nationwide.\n9\n Therefore, there could be other more important carcinogens.\n      Research to date on alternative potential driver risks for prevalent lung cancer in Xuanwei has been revealed. The primary risk arises from environmental pollution. The roles of some metal elements, especially heavy metal elements, are partially known in carcinogenesis in the context of lung cancer. As studies of Yunnan soil are observed, heavy metal pollution with metals of V, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Co, Ni, Pb, As and Zn exceeds the vicinities concentrations, which denotes these metals have heavily polluted the street dusts of Xuanwei. Among which, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cr and As, are considered to be carcinogenic for human with long\u2010term dusts exposure, and Cr is especially relevant for local children's risk.\n10\n The toxicity of Pb on lungs has been found to related to the increases in Nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) levels, which further lead to the increases of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cytochromes of the 1 subfamily (CYP1A1).\n11\n Another study shows that Cr(VI) causes alterations in DNA modification and microRNAs.\n12\n Moreover, LUSC patients show lower Ti expression but higher miR\u201024\u20103p and miR\u201028\u20105p.\n13\n Some other studies have found the association between the high lung cancer incidence and the contamination of metal elements in Xuanwei area.\n10\n, \n14\n A recent study shows that the mean levels of heavy metals especially in the magnetic fractions within the road dust are rather higher than their background values.\n15\n\n\n      Thus, we suggested that the geological composition of the Xuanwei area may have special molecular mechanisms in the development of lung cancer in these area . Furthermore, we would analyse the protein profiling changes of the lung cancer tissues form the patients of Xuanwei area, providing more insights to the large excess incidence of lung cancer in this area and finding specific bio\u2010molecular mechanisms involving the regional lung cancer.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Ethical statement\n        The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University and followed the guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

All subjects were born and lived in Xuanwei area for more than 3 generations and with local bituminous coal contact history over 10\u00a0years. The pathologic diagnosis was performed by a pathologist for all subjects of lung carcinoma. All the patients had not received any anti\u2010tumour treatment before specimen collection. The clinic pathological manifestations were acquired from the medical records of the patients. All the collected specimens were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Cell culture\n        All of the lung cancer cell lines, including A549 and NCI\u2010H1299, were purchased from Shanghai Cellular Research Institute and maintained in RPMI\u20101640 medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 100\u00a0U/mL penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Western blotting\n        The cells were treated under the indicated conditions and then efficient lysed with RIPA buffer at pH 8.0 (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 50\u00a0mM Tris, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). All the samples were quantified using PierceTM bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) to ensure equal loading of proteins. The cellular protein samples were separated by SDS\u2010PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocked by 5% BSA, the membrane was probed with the primary antibody and then incubated with HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibody in TBST.

Then, the data set was searched with the SWISS\u2010PROT database. The TMT peptides were quantified by Scaffold version 4.10.0 (Proteome Software, Inc.). Significant changes were defined as a threshold of \u00b11.2\u2010fold change with P value\u00a0<\u00a0.05. Gene Ontology annotation, including biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions, was performed with BLAST2GO (version 2.7), and enrichment analysis of pathways for the differentially expressed proteins employed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) automatic annotation server.\n2.15\n        Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n        The cells were washed with pre\u2010cooled PBS (pH 7.4) and then post\u2010fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate\u2010buffered solution. The samples were sequentially sliced and stained with 2% uranyl acetate (UA), dehydrated in ethanol with graded series and embedded in an epoxy resin.

A total of 11\u00a0134 peptides in the clinic tissue samples were detected, which covers 3473 proteins; of these, 422 differentially expressed proteins (fold\u2010change >1.2 or <0.83 in comparison with the para\u2010carcinoma tissues, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) were found in the analysis with quantitative information and were included in the next bioinformatics analysis. A volcano chart was drawn according to 2 factors, the fold\u2010change and the p value obtained by t test, to show the significant difference in data between the two groups of samples (Figure\u00a01B). We used the hierarchical cluster to compare the differentially expressed proteins of the representative cases, showing with the heat map (Figure\u00a01C). The chart indicated that the threshold of fold\u2010change set in the current study can effectively separate the cancer and the para\u2010carcinoma groups, and the data of each case from the 2 groups were reproducible. According to the description about in GO terms and several recently published studies, various proteins, including TXN2, HP, PCNA, MYH7, POLG, TMEM62, TMEM16F, TMEM131L, SLC34A2, SLC35A3, SLC9A3R2, SLC44A2, HSPH1, HSPA5, LPCAT1, PPP1R14A and PPP2R5C, were screened out (Figure\u00a01D) and subsequently subjected to qPCR validation (Figure\u00a01E).\n        \n          FIGURE 1\n          \n            The proteomic analysis for the clinic carcinoma and para\u2010carcinoma tissues of the patients diagnosed as lung cancer in Xuanwei.

Other various ferroptosis\u2010related proteins that were indicated with blue arrows (Figure\u00a02C) were scattered on the network, further suggesting that ferroptosis probably involved in the progression of NSCLC. In addition, we picked out TXN2 and HP to analyse more potential association with other possible molecules in ferroptosis (Figure\u00a02D,E), and we noticed GPX4 (blue arrow), which is a documented key negative regulator of ferroptosis, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) (blue arrow), a well\u2010known lipid peroxidation inhibitor, are closely implicated. In addition, we noticed that there are few studies about these two proteins TXN2 and HP in ferroptosis. Based on these findings, we decided to pay more attention on these two molecules in the following research.\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Altered expression of Txn2 and HP in lung cancer was associated with ferroptosis\n        We validated the changes of TXN2 and HP in proteomics using several lung cancer cell lines and clinic samples (Figure\u00a03A,B). We observed that TXN2 was significantly decreased but HP increased in the cells treated with the ferroptosis inducers erastin, RSL or sorafenib at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure\u00a03C,D), which indicated that the trend in proteomic analysis was reversed by the inducer. We hypothesized \u2010 that regulating the levels of TXN2 and HP in lung cancer cells would influence the cell proneness to ferroptosis.\n        \n          FIGURE 3\n          \n            Validation of proteomics results.

To further explore the possible role of TXN2 in tumour progression of NSCLC, TXN2 expression in NSCLC from GEO public repository was analysed with GENT2 (http://gent2.appex.kr/gent2/). As a result, we found higher TXN2 levels at later clinical stages, though it was lower in at some stages (Figure\u00a04C). If overexpressed TXN2 plays a role in progression of NSCLC, the patients with different TXN2 level may have different survival results. According to the survival analysis results from Kaplan\u2010Meier plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/), the overall survival (OS) signature (high risk vs. low risk) of TXN2 (Affymetrix ID: 209078_s_at) presents high\u2010TXN2\u2010expression patients\u2019 overall survival time is shorter than that of low\u2010expression NSCLC patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0076), especially for LUAD (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.76, P\u00a0=\u00a02.7e\u20106) (Figure\u00a04D,E). In one of the above data sets (GSE31210, analysed with PrognoScan, http://dna00.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/PrognoScan/index.html), apart from the OS result in Figure\u00a04F (PROBE ID: 209077_at) which was consistent with that in Figure\u00a04D, high\u2010TXN2\u2010expression patients also exhibited lower RFS (relapse free survival) in Figure\u00a04G (PROBE ID: 209077_at). But for LUSC, no significantly differences were found between low\u2010TXN2 and high\u2010TXN2 groups (data not shown).\n        \n          FIGURE 4\n          \n            TXN2 expression profile in NSCLC and its role in prognosis.

The possible role of HP in tumour progression of NSCLC was revealed through analysis of its expression in NSCLC using GENT2 (http://gent2.appex.kr/gent2/) based on GEO public repository. However, lower HP at later clinical stages was not frequently observed (Figure\u00a05C). According to the survival analysis results from The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/), low\u2010HP\u2010expression patients have a poorer overall survival in LUAD (Figure\u00a05D) (cut\u2010off\u00a0=\u00a00.81, P\u00a0=\u00a0.014), but quite in reverse, low\u2010HP\u2010expression patients have a better prognosis for LUSC (Figure\u00a05E) (cut\u2010off\u00a0=\u00a00.36, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). To further validate the role of HP in prognosis of NSCLC, we analysed the survival of patients with low or high HP expression using Kaplan\u2010Meier plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/) that mainly contains GEO (gene expression omnibus) data sets. Against our prediction and the aforesaid result from TCGA, the low\u2010HP\u2010expression (Affymetrix ID: 206697_s_at) patients\u2019 overall survival was better, consistent with which, these patients showed longer time till first progression (Figure\u00a05F,G). In addition, according the survival analysis results from GEO data sets, HP expression level showed no effect on LUSC patients\u2019 survival (data not shown).\n        \n          FIGURE 5\n          \n            HP expression profile in NSCLC and its role in prognosis.

The efficiency of TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure\u00a06A); the mRNA level of TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion induced by erastin or RSL was also detected, as shown in Figure\u00a06B; and erastin or RSL were unable to eliminate TXN2 expression with TXN2 overexpression, whereas erastin or RSL were unable to induce HP expression with HP depletion. Cell viability results revealed that the transfected cells became more resistance to increasing dose of erastin or RSL\u2010induced cell death compared to non\u2010transfected cells by showing higher rates of survival (Figure\u00a06C). The levels of Fe2+ were remarkably decreased (Figure\u00a06D). MDA assays indicated the lower oxidative metabolism of lipids in the blank lung cancer cells under the erastin or RSL treatment, whereas the transfected cells had a lower level of membrane lipid oxidation (Figure\u00a06E). Similarly, changes in ROS also indicated a significant decrease in oxidation levels of the transfected cells under erastin or RSL treatment (Figure\u00a06F). The GSH assays showed that the GSH in the transfected cells was higher (Figure\u00a06G). TXN2 overexpression or HP depletion decreased erastin and RSL\u2010induced lipid oxidation in lung cancer cell lines, which were shown by the green fluorescence intensity (levels of oxidized C11 BODIPY 581/591) (Figure\u00a06H). We found in (Figure\u00a0S1); however, cell deaths and MDA levels induced by ferroptosis inducers would not be reversed by caspase pharmacological inhibitor ZV AD\u2010FMK and the necroptosis inhibitor, Necrosulfonamide, in A549 and NCI\u2010H1299 cell lines, which could be inhibited by specific ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin. This verified the effects of ferroptosis on lung cancer cells and excluded other regulated cell death forms, like apoptosis and necroptosis. All these results suggested that TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion promoted lung cancer resistance were through attenuating ferroptosis.\n        \n          FIGURE 6\n          \n            TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion promoted resistance of lung cancer cell lines through attenuating ferroptosis.

We observed that the transfected cells became more prone to erastin or RSL\u2010induced ferroptosis compared to non\u2010transfected cells by showing lower rates of survival (Figure\u00a07C). Moreover, we also found that the levels of Fe2+ (Figure\u00a07D), MDA (Figure\u00a07E), intracellular lipid ROS (Figure\u00a07F) and lipid peroxidation (Figure\u00a07H) in A549 and NCI\u2010H11299 were remarkably increased and GSH was decreased (Figure\u00a07G). Nonetheless, the effect of both erastin and RSL along with HP overexpression or TXN2 depletion on cell survival levels of Fe2+, MDA, intracellular lipid ROS, lipid peroxidation and GSH could be reversed by ferrostatin (Figure\u00a07C\u2010G).Observation by TEM revealed that the lung cancer cells with interference of TXN2 or overexpression of HP had smaller mitochondria and a decreased number of mitochondrial cristae under the treatment of erastin or RSL, and the proportion of mitochondria with ruptured outer membrane increased in these cells (Figure\u00a07I). These results suggested that upregulating of HP but downregulating TXN2 can increase the ferroptosis rate of lung cancer cells.\n        \n          FIGURE 7\n          \n            TXN2 depletion and HP overexpression enhanced ferroptosis in lung cancer cell lines A549 and NCI\u2010H1299.

Afterwards, we constructed the siTXN2 but HP\u2010overexpressing A549 cells and performed the tumorigenicity tests using the wild\u2010type A549 and the co\u2010transfected A549 cells on nude mice. The efficiency of transfected cells is shown in Figure\u00a08A. When the tumours reached 50\u2009mm3 at day 2, mice were treated with erastin for 26\u00a0days (Figure\u00a08B). We also found that the co\u2010transfected cells were more sensitive to erastin or RSL treatment in vivo, which showed that the tumour volume was much smaller than the group of wild\u2010type A549 at 28\u00a0days after implantation (Figure\u00a08C,D).

Other various ferroptosis\u2010related proteins that were indicated with blue arrows (Figure\u00a02C) were scattered on the network, further suggesting that ferroptosis probably involved in the progression of NSCLC. In addition, we picked out TXN2 and HP to analyse more potential association with other possible molecules in ferroptosis (Figure\u00a02D,E), and we noticed GPX4 (blue arrow), which is a documented key negative regulator of ferroptosis, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) (blue arrow), a well\u2010known lipid peroxidation inhibitor, are closely implicated. In addition, we noticed that there are few studies about these two proteins TXN2 and HP in ferroptosis. Based on these findings, we decided to pay more attention on these two molecules in the following research.\n3.3\n        Altered expression of Txn2 and HP in lung cancer was associated with ferroptosis\n        We validated the changes of TXN2 and HP in proteomics using several lung cancer cell lines and clinic samples (Figure\u00a03A,B). We observed that TXN2 was significantly decreased but HP increased in the cells treated with the ferroptosis inducers erastin, RSL or sorafenib at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure\u00a03C,D), which indicated that the trend in proteomic analysis was reversed by the inducer. We hypothesized \u2010 that regulating the levels of TXN2 and HP in lung cancer cells would influence the cell proneness to ferroptosis.\n        \n          FIGURE 3\n          \n            Validation of proteomics results.

To further explore the possible role of TXN2 in tumour progression of NSCLC, TXN2 expression in NSCLC from GEO public repository was analysed with GENT2 (http://gent2.appex.kr/gent2/). As a result, we found higher TXN2 levels at later clinical stages, though it was lower in at some stages (Figure\u00a04C). If overexpressed TXN2 plays a role in progression of NSCLC, the patients with different TXN2 level may have different survival results. According to the survival analysis results from Kaplan\u2010Meier plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/), the overall survival (OS) signature (high risk vs. low risk) of TXN2 (Affymetrix ID: 209078_s_at) presents high\u2010TXN2\u2010expression patients\u2019 overall survival time is shorter than that of low\u2010expression NSCLC patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0076), especially for LUAD (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.76, P\u00a0=\u00a02.7e\u20106) (Figure\u00a04D,E). In one of the above data sets (GSE31210, analysed with PrognoScan, http://dna00.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/PrognoScan/index.html), apart from the OS result in Figure\u00a04F (PROBE ID: 209077_at) which was consistent with that in Figure\u00a04D, high\u2010TXN2\u2010expression patients also exhibited lower RFS (relapse free survival) in Figure\u00a04G (PROBE ID: 209077_at). But for LUSC, no significantly differences were found between low\u2010TXN2 and high\u2010TXN2 groups (data not shown).\n        \n          FIGURE 4\n          \n            TXN2 expression profile in NSCLC and its role in prognosis.

The possible role of HP in tumour progression of NSCLC was revealed through analysis of its expression in NSCLC using GENT2 (http://gent2.appex.kr/gent2/) based on GEO public repository. However, lower HP at later clinical stages was not frequently observed (Figure\u00a05C). According to the survival analysis results from The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/), low\u2010HP\u2010expression patients have a poorer overall survival in LUAD (Figure\u00a05D) (cut\u2010off\u00a0=\u00a00.81, P\u00a0=\u00a0.014), but quite in reverse, low\u2010HP\u2010expression patients have a better prognosis for LUSC (Figure\u00a05E) (cut\u2010off\u00a0=\u00a00.36, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). To further validate the role of HP in prognosis of NSCLC, we analysed the survival of patients with low or high HP expression using Kaplan\u2010Meier plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/) that mainly contains GEO (gene expression omnibus) data sets. Against our prediction and the aforesaid result from TCGA, the low\u2010HP\u2010expression (Affymetrix ID: 206697_s_at) patients\u2019 overall survival was better, consistent with which, these patients showed longer time till first progression (Figure\u00a05F,G). In addition, according the survival analysis results from GEO data sets, HP expression level showed no effect on LUSC patients\u2019 survival (data not shown).\n        \n          FIGURE 5\n          \n            HP expression profile in NSCLC and its role in prognosis.

The efficiency of TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure\u00a06A); the mRNA level of TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion induced by erastin or RSL was also detected, as shown in Figure\u00a06B; and erastin or RSL were unable to eliminate TXN2 expression with TXN2 overexpression, whereas erastin or RSL were unable to induce HP expression with HP depletion. Cell viability results revealed that the transfected cells became more resistance to increasing dose of erastin or RSL\u2010induced cell death compared to non\u2010transfected cells by showing higher rates of survival (Figure\u00a06C). The levels of Fe2+ were remarkably decreased (Figure\u00a06D). MDA assays indicated the lower oxidative metabolism of lipids in the blank lung cancer cells under the erastin or RSL treatment, whereas the transfected cells had a lower level of membrane lipid oxidation (Figure\u00a06E). Similarly, changes in ROS also indicated a significant decrease in oxidation levels of the transfected cells under erastin or RSL treatment (Figure\u00a06F). The GSH assays showed that the GSH in the transfected cells was higher (Figure\u00a06G). TXN2 overexpression or HP depletion decreased erastin and RSL\u2010induced lipid oxidation in lung cancer cell lines, which were shown by the green fluorescence intensity (levels of oxidized C11 BODIPY 581/591) (Figure\u00a06H). We found in (Figure\u00a0S1); however, cell deaths and MDA levels induced by ferroptosis inducers would not be reversed by caspase pharmacological inhibitor ZV AD\u2010FMK and the necroptosis inhibitor, Necrosulfonamide, in A549 and NCI\u2010H1299 cell lines, which could be inhibited by specific ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin. This verified the effects of ferroptosis on lung cancer cells and excluded other regulated cell death forms, like apoptosis and necroptosis. All these results suggested that TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion promoted lung cancer resistance were through attenuating ferroptosis.\n        \n          FIGURE 6\n          \n            TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion promoted resistance of lung cancer cell lines through attenuating ferroptosis.

We observed that the transfected cells became more prone to erastin or RSL\u2010induced ferroptosis compared to non\u2010transfected cells by showing lower rates of survival (Figure\u00a07C). Moreover, we also found that the levels of Fe2+ (Figure\u00a07D), MDA (Figure\u00a07E), intracellular lipid ROS (Figure\u00a07F) and lipid peroxidation (Figure\u00a07H) in A549 and NCI\u2010H11299 were remarkably increased and GSH was decreased (Figure\u00a07G). Nonetheless, the effect of both erastin and RSL along with HP overexpression or TXN2 depletion on cell survival levels of Fe2+, MDA, intracellular lipid ROS, lipid peroxidation and GSH could be reversed by ferrostatin (Figure\u00a07C\u2010G).Observation by TEM revealed that the lung cancer cells with interference of TXN2 or overexpression of HP had smaller mitochondria and a decreased number of mitochondrial cristae under the treatment of erastin or RSL, and the proportion of mitochondria with ruptured outer membrane increased in these cells (Figure\u00a07I). These results suggested that upregulating of HP but downregulating TXN2 can increase the ferroptosis rate of lung cancer cells.\n        \n          FIGURE 7\n          \n            TXN2 depletion and HP overexpression enhanced ferroptosis in lung cancer cell lines A549 and NCI\u2010H1299.

Afterwards, we constructed the siTXN2 but HP\u2010overexpressing A549 cells and performed the tumorigenicity tests using the wild\u2010type A549 and the co\u2010transfected A549 cells on nude mice. The efficiency of transfected cells is shown in Figure\u00a08A. When the tumours reached 50\u2009mm3 at day 2, mice were treated with erastin for 26\u00a0days (Figure\u00a08B). We also found that the co\u2010transfected cells were more sensitive to erastin or RSL treatment in vivo, which showed that the tumour volume was much smaller than the group of wild\u2010type A549 at 28\u00a0days after implantation (Figure\u00a08C,D). Therefore, promoting the development of lung cancer by inhibiting ferroptosis may be a potential and special mechanism for the high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei.\n        \n          FIGURE 8\n          \n            The expressions of TXN2 and HP affected ferroptosis in nude mice.

As it is the main coal mining area in south\u2010western China, several geochemical studies have shown that mineral elements are associated with a high incidence of lung cancer in this area.\n10\n, \n16\n To date, the cause of high occurrence of lung cancer in Xuanwei area remains far from clear.\n      To identify the vital candidates for lung cancer pathogenesis of patients from Xuanwei, bioinformatic methods were applied firstly. Microarray study was used to analyse the altered protein profiling between carcinoma and para\u2010carcinoma tissues from Xuanwei area, and then, pathway enrichment was used to explore the interactions of these differential proteins and the present study showed pathways enriched in 5 processes including small cell lung cancer, ECM\u2010receptor interaction, focal adhesion, PI3K/AKT and amoebiasis. Apart from amoebiasis, the above pathways like ECM\u2010receptor interaction and adhesive attraction\n17\n and PI3K/AKT\n18\n are greatly noted in lung cancer previously, which may be responsible for lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In addition, centrally involved TXN2 and HP as two key factors of the PPI network were identified. Also, our network analysis implicated that TXN2 associated with the established negative ferroptosis regulator GPX4 and HP interconnected with the lipid peroxidation inhibitor APOE; moreover, both TXN2 and HP are ferroptosis\u2010related molecules. Ferroptosis is a recently identified form of cell death, which differs from apoptosis, cell necrosis and autophagy. It is caused by the accumulation of the products of iron\u2010dependent lipid peroxidation.\n19\n, \n20\n Considering the growth of cancer cell is iron dependency, which means cancer cell including lung cancer can evade apoptosis but to be more susceptible to an iron\u2010induced ferroptosis. Morphologically, the cells showed a decrease in volume, an increase in mitochondrial membrane density and disappearance of mitochondrial cristae during ferroptosis.\n21\n At the molecular level, phospholipid\u2010bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PL\u2010PUFAs) are peroxidized during ferroptosis to generation ROS and achieve cell kill, which can be eliminated by 3 parallel pathways: GPX4\u2010glutathione, fibroblast\u2010specific protein 1 (FSP1)\u2010CoQ10 and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH)1\u2010BH4.\n22\n Several other molecules have been found to regulate ferroptosis in lung cancer, such as the erythroid 2\u2010related factor 2 (Nrf2)\n23\n and serine threonine tyrosine kinase 1 (STYK1).\n24\n Besides, growing evidences suggest an important lethal role for iron and ferroptosis in lung cancer.\n25\n Given that the main emitted chemical particle from coal combustion is iron in Xuanwei, which is reducible and could generate ROS, a study focused on the valence state of iron in size\u2010resolved particle found that oxidizable iron accounts for a large proportion of raw coal samples, whereas a large percentage of redox\u2010active fractions of iron (46%\u201078%) in fly ash particles after coal combustion. In addition, the concentration of \u00b7OH was higher in fine particles than coarse particles.\n26\n Thus, we guess ion may link to lung cancer, and ferroptosis may be responsible for Xuanwei lung cancer.\n      As an important antioxidant defence mechanism, TXN system has attracted researchers' attention to its role in ferroptosis.\n27\n The persistent activation of antioxidant systems and overexpression of thioredoxin via genetic alterations in Nrf2 and Keap1 also contributes to carcinogenesis.\n28\n Moreover, a recent study reported genetic knockdown of TXN leads to accumulation of lipid ROS levels and induces an antioxidant response to cause ferroptosis, a potential pro\u2010ferroptotic agent due to its inhibition of TXN would be an anti\u2010cancer therapeutic strategy.\n29\n HP is a plasma protein that has the ability to combine with free haemoglobin, which allows hepatic recycling of heme iron to function in preventing kidney from damage. HP also has antibacterial activity and plays an essential role in regulating responses under the acute phase.\n30\n The expression of HP was found increased after intracerebral haemorrhage in vivo, which could prevent haemoglobin\u2010induced neuronal ferroptosis is as an antioxidant.\n31\n HP polymorphism causes change in haemoglobin\u2010bind capacity, antioxidant and iron\u2010recycling activities, which may be important for effective oxidative stress response in lung cancer pathogenic process.\n32\n Specifically, in the present study, we supposed that HP and TXN2 may be involved in ferroptosis and contribute to lung cancer in Xuanwei area.\n      It was revealed that TXN2 up\u2010regulated and HP downregulated in lung cancer cell tissues of Xuanwei patients and 3 lung cancer cell lines. Public data also supported that TXN2 enhanced in LUSC but not in LUAD, HP downregulated in both LUAD and LUSC. Online data showed higher TXN2 levels at later clinical stages, whereas lower HP at later clinical stages was not frequently observed. Kaplan\u2010Meier survival analysis suggested that higher TXN2 levels and lower HP levels might be unfavourable factors of in LUAD prognosis.\n      In addition, the results also indicated that ferroptosis inducer erastin or RSL downregulated TXN2 and up\u2010regulated HP. Further experiments with overexpressed TXN2 or interfered with HP in lung cancer cell lines demonstrated that TXN2 overexpression and HP depletion promoted lung cancer resistance to erastin or RSL\u2010induced cell death were through attenuating ferroptosis, whereas upregulating of HP but downregulating TXN2 increased the ferroptosis rate of lung cancer cells. The increase of cell death and MDA by erastin and RSL could not be affected with inhibitors of these two pathways in our study, which distinguished ferroptosis from apoptosis and necroptosis. That ferrostatin inhibited the inhibitory effects of altered TXN2 and HP may validate functions of TXN2 and HP during ferroptosis. Besides, co\u2010transfected with siTXN2 and HP overexpression vector significantly increased the size, volume of the tumour in vivo. Together, our results demonstrate that down\u2010regulated TXN2 and up\u2010regulated HP made the cancer cells more resistant, which could be a specific mechanism for the lung cancer in Xuanwei area. Further studies are needed to verify the changes in a larger cohort and to establish the association between the molecules and the high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei area.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\n      Guangjian Li: Data curation (equal); Formal analysis (equal); Methodology (equal); Resources (equal); Writing\u2010original draft (equal).
