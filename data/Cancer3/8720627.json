There is a critical need to identify novel biomarkers to improve the therapy and overall prognosis of this disease.\nMethods\n          Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from three profiles of GSE101586, GSE101684 and GSE112214 using Venn diagrams. hsa_circ_0043256 were validated using quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR). The circular RNA\u2013microRNA\u2013messenger RNA (circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA) regulatory network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.7.0. Hub genes were identified with protein interaction (PPI) and validated with the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases, and immunohistochemistry. Survival analyses were also performed using a Kaplan\u2013Meier (KM) plotter. The effects of hsa_circ_0043256 on cell proliferation and cell cycles were evaluated by EdU staining and flow cytometry, respectively.\nRESULTS\n      \n        Identification of DECs and DEGs in lung cancer\n        Three microarray datasets (GSE101586, GSE101684, and GSE112214) were included in this study, the basic information of which are shown in Table\u00a01. A total of 68 DECs with 47 upregulated circRNAs and 21 downregulated circRNAs were identified from GSE78520 (Figure\u00a02(a)); 410 DECs with 236 upregulated circRNAs and 174 downregulated circRNAs were identified from GSE101684 (Figure\u00a02(b)); 149 DECs with 16 upregulated circRNAs and 133 downregulated circRNAs were identified from GSE112214 (Figure\u00a02(c)). A total of three downregulated circRNAs (hsa_circ_0043256, hsa_circ_0029426, and hsa_circ_0049271) were obtained using a Venn diagram of three datasheets (Table\u00a01). The essential characteristics of the three DECs are displayed in Table\u00a01. The basic structural patterns of the three circRNAs are exhibited in Figure\u00a03.\n        \n          FIGURE 2\n          \n            Volcano plots for DECs in NSCLC based on the three microarray datasets from GEO.

The results were verified using Sanger sequencing. The results of qPCR showed that hsa_circ_0043256 was significantly downregulated in lung cancer patient tissues (Figure\u00a04(a)) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0405), whereas the expression of hsa_circ_0029426 and hsa_circ_0049271 in lung cancer tissues was similar to that observed for non\u2010cancerous tissues (Figure\u00a0S1). Furthermore, the head\u2010to\u2010tail splicing in the qRT\u2010PCR product of hsa_circ_0043256, hsa_circ_0029426, and hsa_circ_0049271 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Figure\u00a05).

The expression of hsa_circ_0043256 was determined in eight lung cancer cell lines and the normal human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS\u20102B was determined using qRT\u2010PCR. Results showed that hsa_circ_0043256 was significantly downregulated in lung cancer cell lines (Figure\u00a04(a)). We performed EdU staining and flow cytometry to investigate the effect of hsa_circ_0043256 on the cell proliferation of the NSCLC cells. H1299 and PC9 cell lines were transfected with hsa_circ_0043256 overexpression plasmid and the negative control (Figure\u00a04(b)). The results of EdU staining demonstrated that overexpression of hsa_circ_0043256 can inhibit proliferation of NSCLC cells (Figure\u00a04(c)). Furthermore, flow cytometry showed that hsa_circ_0043256 can also inhibit the progression of the cell cycle of NSCLC cells (Figure\u00a04(d)). Taken together, hsa_circ_0043256 was capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and cell\u2010cycle progression of NSCLC cells in vitro.\n      \n      \n        Construction of the circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2010mRNA network\n        The circular RNA Interactome and circBank database was used to predict the potential target miRNAs of DECs. A total of 24 potential target miRNAs of hsa_circ_0043256 were obtained from circular RNA Interactome, and 35 potential target miRNAs were obtained from circBank. By merging these two screening results, three miRNAs (hsa\u2010miR\u20101183\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u20101303\u20105p, and hsa\u2010miR\u2010512\u20105p) were obtained by Venn diagram (Figure\u00a06(a)). miRWalk was used to predict the target mRNA of these three miRNAs. A total of 1959 potential target mRNAs were obtained.\n        \n          FIGURE 6\n          \n            Identification of 209 potentially important genes in NSCLC. (a) Three sharing microRNAs.

A total of 209 overlapped genes were acquired to the construction of the miRNA\u2013mRNA network using Venn diagram by intersecting the DEGs from TCGA and the targeted mRNAs of three miRNAs by miRWalk (Figure\u00a06(b)). In an attempt to better understand the potential role of circRNAs, the network contained 1 circRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 209 genes were obtained (Figure\u00a07).\n        \n          FIGURE 7\n          \n            CircRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA regulatory network for hsa_circ_0043256 in NSCLC.

For GO analysis, with respect to the biological process (BP), the DEGs were enriched in GO:0007605 sensory perception of sound, GO:0050954 sensory perception of mechanical stimulus, and GO:0007155 cell adhesion. Regarding cellular components (CC), the top three enriched terms were GO:0099055 integral component of postsynaptic membrane, GO:0098936 intrinsic component of postsynaptic membrane, and GO:0005911 cell\u2013cell junction. In terms of molecular function (MF), GO:0033691 sialic acid binding, GO:0008191 metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity and GO:0016709 oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen, NAD(P)H as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen were the top three hits. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that several pathways were significantly enriched, including caffeine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis (Figure\u00a08).\n        \n          FIGURE 8\n          \n            Functional analysis of 209 mRNAs in the network.

A total of 139 nodes and 175 edges were mapped on the PPI network (Figure\u00a09). The hub genes were collected by the MCODE algorithm. The top five hub genes were baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5), SHC binding and spindle associated 1 (SHCBP1), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), spindle and kinetochore associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3), and GINS complex subunit 1 (GINS1).\n        \n          FIGURE 9\n          \n            Identification of hub genes from the PPI network with the MCODE algorithm.

The flowchart for this procedure is shown in Figure\u00a01. The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs), differentially expressed miRNAs (DEIs), and differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) were identified. Importantly, the expression of hsa_circ_0043256 and its biological functions were validated in vitro, and ceRNA (circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA) regulatory network was conducted. This study will illuminate the underlying mechanisms of lung cancer and may help provide reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis of this disease.\n      \n        FIGURE 1\n        \n          Flowchart of the study. First, three datasets from GEO to obtain DECs, and validated by RT\u2010qPCR and functional experiments in vitro. Next, the prediction miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs obtained from TCGA were intersected. Next, we constructed a circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA network around hsa_circ_0043256 and GO and KEGG analyses. Subsequently, a PPI network was established and hub genes were identified, and validated with GEPIA, HPA databases, and immunohistochemistry, and a KM plotter\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        Data collection\n        Three circRNA expression profiles (GSE101586, GSE101684 and GSE112214) were downloaded from the GEO, (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), analyzed on the Agilent\u2010069978 Arraystar Human CircRNA microarray V1 GPL19978 platform.

CircRNAs with statistical significance between lung cancer and non\u2010tumor tissues in GSE101586, GSE101684, and GSE112214 were screened, respectively. Next, circRNAs upregulated or downregulated in both profiles were selected and identified.

The structure of circRNAs and the secondary stem\u2010loop structure of miRNAs were also predicted using the cancer\u2010specific circRNA database (CSCD).\n7\n\n\n      \n      \n        Construction of circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2010mRNA regulatory network\n        To predict the interactions of circRNA and miRNA, circular RNA Interactome\n8\n (https://circinteractome.nia.nih.gov) and circBank (http://www.circbank.cn/) were used. We identified overlapped miRNAs of the two algorithms as potential target miRNAs (DEIs) of the DECs. In addition, we used miRWalk (version 2.0; http://zmf.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/),\n9\nof which four bioinformatic algorithms (RNA22, miRanda, miRWalk, and Targetscan) were selected to predict miRNA\u2010targeted mRNAs of the three essential miRNAs. Only mRNAs recognized by all the four algorithms were considered to be candidate mRNAs. All the candidate mRNAs predicted to the three essential miRNAs were merged with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from TCGA between lung cancer and non\u2010tumor tissues. The common DEGs across miRNA\u2010targets and the TCGA were analyzed with Venn plot. The circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.0 software\n10\n using the correlations between DECs, DEIs, and DEGs.\n      \n      \n        Bioinformatic DEG analysis\n        Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) using the GO and KEGG pathway methods. The results were downloaded and visualized using the Goplot package. A GO term or KEGG pathway with adj. p\u2010value <\u20090.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The top 20 enriched GO terms and pathways of DEGs were ranked according to enrichment score (log10 [p value]). The PPI network of 209 DEGs was established by the STRING 10.5 and visualized by the Cytoscape 3.7.1.\n      \n      \n        Reconstruction of the circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013hub gene network\n        Hub\u2010genes were selected by Cytoscape Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) app from the PPI network. To identify the association between DECs, DEIs, and hub genes, the subnetwork of circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013hub gene network was identified.\n      \n      \n        Validation of hub genes\n        The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) was used to compare differential expression of common cancer types and their normal adjacent tissues.

A total of 24 potential target miRNAs of hsa_circ_0043256 were obtained from circular RNA Interactome, and 35 potential target miRNAs were obtained from circBank. By merging these two screening results, three miRNAs (hsa\u2010miR\u20101183\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u20101303\u20105p, and hsa\u2010miR\u2010512\u20105p) were obtained by Venn diagram (Figure\u00a06(a)). miRWalk was used to predict the target mRNA of these three miRNAs.

A total of 209 overlapped genes were acquired to the construction of the miRNA\u2013mRNA network using Venn diagram by intersecting the DEGs from TCGA and the targeted mRNAs of three miRNAs by miRWalk (Figure\u00a06(b)). In an attempt to better understand the potential role of circRNAs, the network contained 1 circRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 209 genes were obtained (Figure\u00a07).\n        \n          FIGURE 7\n          \n            CircRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA regulatory network for hsa_circ_0043256 in NSCLC.

For GO analysis, with respect to the biological process (BP), the DEGs were enriched in GO:0007605 sensory perception of sound, GO:0050954 sensory perception of mechanical stimulus, and GO:0007155 cell adhesion. Regarding cellular components (CC), the top three enriched terms were GO:0099055 integral component of postsynaptic membrane, GO:0098936 intrinsic component of postsynaptic membrane, and GO:0005911 cell\u2013cell junction. In terms of molecular function (MF), GO:0033691 sialic acid binding, GO:0008191 metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity and GO:0016709 oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen, NAD(P)H as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen were the top three hits. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that several pathways were significantly enriched, including caffeine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis (Figure\u00a08).\n        \n          FIGURE 8\n          \n            Functional analysis of 209 mRNAs in the network.

A total of 139 nodes and 175 edges were mapped on the PPI network (Figure\u00a09). The hub genes were collected by the MCODE algorithm. The top five hub genes were baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5), SHC binding and spindle associated 1 (SHCBP1), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), spindle and kinetochore associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3), and GINS complex subunit 1 (GINS1).\n        \n          FIGURE 9\n          \n            Identification of hub genes from the PPI network with the MCODE algorithm.

Following RT\u2010qPCR validation of the three DECs, and hsa_circ_0043256 was found to be significantly downregulated in both lung cancer patient tissues and cell lines. Further, our results showed that hsa_circ_0043256 was capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and cell\u2010cycle progression of NSCLC cells in vitro. Therefore, hsa_circ_0043256 was selected for further analysis.\n      Numerous studies have shown that circRNA can bind to miRNAs and serve as ceRNAs and regulate gene expression.\n6\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\nWe next investigated the ability of hsa_circ_0043256 to bind miRNAs. Circinteractome and circBank database were used to explore the miRNA response elements (MREs) harbored by hsa_circ_0043256. We chose miRNAs predicted by both algorithms as the putative target miRNA for hsa_circ_0043256. Finally, three miRNAs (hsa\u2010miR\u20101183\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u20101303\u20105p, and hsa\u2010miR\u2010512\u20105p) were selected. Increasing evidence has indicated that miRNAs may regulate gene expression by binding to the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of some target genes. miRwalk was used to predict the potential target mRNAs of the three miRNAs. A total of 1959 potential target mRNAs were obtained. In addition, 1779 DEGs with 745 upregulated mRNAs and 1034 downregulated mRNAs were identified from the TCGA database between lung cancer and normal lung tissues. We chose the common 209 mRNAs of these two sections as the common DEGs for further analysis. Based on the results, we established the circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA network, including one circRNA, three miRNAs, and 209 mRNAs, in an attempt to better understand the potential role of circRNAs.\n      To explore the potential mechanism of circRNAs on lung cancer, we performed functional analysis of the DEGs by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The GO analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in sensory perception of sound (GO:0007605), integral component of postsynaptic membrane (GO:0099055), and sialic acid binding immune response (GO:0033691). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly associated with caffeine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis. Caffeine is a naturally occurring methylxanthine non\u2010selective adenosine receptor antagonist that can be found in many beverages like coffee and tea. Caffeine has been reported to have antitumor activity in animals and some cancer cell lines.\n16\n Caffeine metabolism pathway has been reported to be the only significant metabolic pathway in predicting the survival outcome among NSCLC patients.\n17\n It has been reported that caffeine may mediate DNA\u2010repair inhibition, and may be a higher risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma. This metabolism is mediated by genetics related to variations of specific genes. Although CYP1A2 is understood to be the main player, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are also believed to participate in primary metabolism of caffeine.\n18\n, \n19\n Caffeine has been reported to enhance antitumor immune response through decreased expression of PD1 on infiltrated cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\n20\n The linoleic acid (LA) metabolism pathway is first performed by \u03946\u2010desaturase, which converts LA into gamma\u2010linolenic acid (GLA).\n21\n, \n22\n Animals lack \u03946\u2010desaturase on their own, and acquire it through breast milk. Studies show that breast\u2010milk fed babies have higher concentrations of GLA.\n23\n The metabolites of LA can mediate inflammation, which is understood to depend on FADS1 gene.\n24\n The arginase pathway hydrolyzes arginine to urea and ornithine, which is then hydrolyzed by ornithine aminotransferase (RocD) and \u0394\u2010pyrroline\u20105\u2010carboxylate dehydrogenase (RocA), respectively, with the production of glutamate. Arginine metabolism consists of several cytosolic urea cycle enzymes, including argininosuccinate synthase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), and arginase and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), among which ASS is the key enzyme.\n25\n ASS is a rate\u2010limiting biosynthetic enzyme for intracellular arginine synthesis in different cells. However, in some tumor cells like hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, etc, it is reduced or even absent.\n26\n, \n27\n There is more evidence that indicates that arginine may be serving as a node for the regulation of immune responses.\n28\n In signal transduction pathways in immune cells, arginine may be functioning, arginine may be as an enzyme substrate and also as a regulatory molecule.\n29\n Because of the important role of arginine in cell proliferation and host immune responses, targeting the arginine metabolism pathway for arginine deprivation could be an effective treatment strategy for cancer patients.\n27\n\n\n      To further identify the key circRNAs that participate in the regulatory network, DEGs PPI network complex was developed and the most significant five hub genes, including BIRC5, SHCBP1, CCNA2, SKA3, and GINS1, were selected as the key in the PPI network. GEPIA and HPA databases were used to validate the five hub genes at transcriptional and translational levels. Results showed that the mRNA expression of BIRC5, SHCBP1, CCNA2, SKA3 and GINS1 in LUAD and LUSC tissues were all significantly higher than that in normal tissues, whereas only BIRC5 and CCNA2 protein expression in lung cancer tissues were much higher than those in the normal lung tissues. The KM plotter was used to show the correlation between hub genes and survival prognosis. Results showed that all hub genes were significantly related to survival analysis results.\n      BIRC5, also called survivin, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family.\n30\n, \n31\n BIRC5 is a direct target gene of the Wnt pathway and is upregulated by beta\u2010catenin.\n32\n It has been shown that BIRC5 is a multifunctional protein that plays critical roles in several crucial cell processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell cycle, and chromosome movement.30\n SHCBP1 is an important connexin on the SH2 domain of the SHC protein. It has been shown to play critical roles in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and cell\u2010cycle progression, especially in the carcinogenesis.\n33\n Zou et al.\n34\n found that SHCBP1 is remarkably upregulated in lung cancer, and overexpression of SHCBP1 promoted cisplatin induced apoptosis resistance, migration, and invasion. In addition, lung cancer patients with high SHCBP1 had poor prognosis. CCNA2 is the gene of cyclin\u2010A2 protein. Cyclin\u2010A2, one of the two types of cyclin A, is an essential regulator of the cell division cycle; it binds CDK2 during the S phase, and CDK1 during the transition from the G2 to M phase.\n35\n Ruan et al.\n36\n found that ectopic expression of CCNA2 accelerates NSCLC cell migration and invasion through integrin the \u03b1V\u03b23 signaling pathway in lung cancer cells, and suppression of CCNA2 expression inhibits metastasis of NSCLC cells. SKA3, a subunit of SKA1 complex, has been reported to be important in phosphorylation of Cdk1 in mitosis; it binds to Ndc80C and recruits the Ska complex to kinetochores.\n37\n Previous studies have reported that SKA3 participates in cancer pathogenesis and progression.\n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n Hu et al.\n38\n found that SKA3 is overexpressed in LUAD and its expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Further, reduced expression of SKA3 can significantly inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer cells. GINS1 is a subunit of the tetrameric complex termed GINS complex, which is essential for establishment of DNA replication forks. GINS has been suggested to be involved in DNA replication because of its binding to DNA replication protein.\n41\n Several recent studies have suggested that GINS1 plays an important role in tumor growth.\n42\n, \n43\n For example, Zhang et al.\n43\n found that PSF1 was overexpressed in lung cancer samples compared to adjacent non\u2010tumor samples, and knockdown of PSF1 was found to inhibit cell proliferation and caused cell\u2010cycle arrest of lung cancer cells in a p53\u2010independent manner.\n      In summary, in our study we constructed and analyzed a circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA network of hsa_circ_0043256 based on the ceRNA theory via comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. This work may help to further explore the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer, because hsa_circ_0043256 may be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. Future studies are needed to explore the specific mechanisms of hsa_circ_0043256 and to better understand the role of these regulatory modules in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nSupporting information\n      \n        \n          \nFigure S1.
