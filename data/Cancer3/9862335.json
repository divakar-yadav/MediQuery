    "abstract": "Individuals who were unable to give informed consent, had a medical disability and were unlikely to complete curative lung cancer surgery, had a history of lung cancer, had received treatment for or had evidence of any cancer within the past 5 years (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and most in situ carcinomas), or had symptoms suggestive of lung cancer (including unexplained weight loss of >7.5 kg within the past 12 months or unexplained hemoptysis) were not eligible to participate. Women in China have their own characteristics of lung cancer risk factor exposure and incidence patterns, the most critical of which is that although the smoking rate among women is much lower than that of high-income countries such as the United States (2.4% in China and 23.6% in the United States), the lung cancer frequencies are relatively similar (22.8/100,000 in China and 30.8/100,000 in the United States, based on the standardized lung cancer incidence rate of the world population) [10,11].

    "description": "Background\n          It is believed that smoking is not the cause of approximately 53% of lung cancers diagnosed in women globally.\nObjective\n          The study aimed to develop and validate a simple and noninvasive model that could assess and stratify lung cancer risk in nonsmoking Chinese women.\nMethods\n      \n        Data Source and Subjects\n        This retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study was carried out inside the scope of CanSPUC, a continuing statewide cancer-screening program for China\u2019s urban population. CanSPUC is designed to detect the 5 most common malignancies, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, liver cancer, and female breast cancer. The CanSPUC approach was detailed in previous studies [47,48]. All of the qualified subjects were questioned by highly skilled staff to gather information about their exposure to risk variables and to assess their cancer risk using a specific cancer risk score system. The household registration system was used in local communities to identify eligible permanent residents who were aged 40-74 years and asymptomatic for lung cancer with no history of cancer diagnosis. Individuals who were unable to give informed consent, had a medical disability and were unlikely to complete curative lung cancer surgery, had a history of lung cancer, had received treatment for or had evidence of any cancer within the past 5 years (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and most in situ carcinomas), or had symptoms suggestive of lung cancer (including unexplained weight loss of >7.5 kg within the past 12 months or unexplained hemoptysis) were not eligible to participate. In October 2013, CanSPUC was implemented in Henan province, which encompassed 8 cities with complete cancer registration data (Zhengzhou, Zhumadian, Anyang, Luoyang, Nanyang, Jiaozuo, Puyang, and Xinxiang). We examined the data collected over the first 6 years (from October 2013 to October 2019) in the Henan province for our research. Only nonsmoking women were included in this investigation.\n      \n      \n        Ethics Approval\n        The Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital evaluated and authorized the research (no.2021-KY-0028-001). Our sample was drawn from retrospective encounters documented in the electronic health record; these data were deidentified for both sets of analyses and did not require informed consent.\n      \n      \n        Outcome, Variables, and Measurements\n        All new cases of lung cancer were identified by matching with the cancer registry database in Henan province, China (by unique ID number), and histologically confirmed between October 1, 2013, and March 10, 2020. In Henan province, records of lung cancer are first submitted to local cancer registries by the hospitals and medical institutions and then submitted to the Henan Provincial Central Cancer Registry of China by the local cancer registries. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision was used to classify newly diagnosed lung malignancies by site. Lung cancers were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code of C33-C34. To find possible lung cancer risk variables, self-reported information was collected (Textbox 1).\n        \n          \n            Self-reported information collected.\n          \n          \n            \n              \nDemographic factors, such as age, ethnicity, educational status, marital status, height, and body weight\n\n              \n                \n                  A low-educational level was defined as elementary school or less, a medium educational level as junior or senior high school, and a high-educational level as college or above\n                \n                \n                  According to the \u201cGuidelines for the Prevention and Control of Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Adults,\u201d BMI was dependent on the individual\u2019s height as well as weight and segmented to \u201c<18.5 kg/m2,\u201d \u201c18.5-23.9 kg/m2,\u201d \u201c24.0-27.9 kg/m2,\u201d and \u201c\u226528.0 kg/m2\u201d categories [49]\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \nDietary habit\n\n              \n                \n                  Dietary intake of the following food in the past 2 years: vegetables (green-leafy plants and fungi except potatoes, sweet potatoes, and starches) <2.5 kg/week or \u22652.5 kg/week; roughage (all other grains except for white flour and rice) <0.5 kg/week or \u22650.5 kg/week; and fruit <1.25 kg/week or \u22651.25 kg/week.

Subjects who engage in at least three sessions of practice weekly for a total of \u226590 minutes weekly were classified as engaging in \u201cheavy physical activity\u201d; otherwise, they were classified as engaging in \u201cmoderate or no physical activity\u201d\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \nPsychology and emotions, such as a history of serious trauma and more than 6 months of mental depression\n\n              \n                \n                  Serious trauma was described as a major illness or death of a family member, family conflict and separation, significant loss of property, unexpected job loss, severe unexpected physical injury, violent danger, etc\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \nComorbidities, such as chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma bronchiectasis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes\n\n              \n                \n                  Every self-reported case of comorbidity required an evaluation from a professional medical facility\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \nFamily history of lung cancer\n\n              \n                \n                  Whether first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, or third-degree relatives had lung cancer or not\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \nPhysiology and fertility\n\n              \n                \n                  Including age of menarche (<12 years or \u226512 years), menopause (yes or no), fertility status (yes or no), lactation status (yes or no), history of benign breast illness (yes or no), and a history of reproductive system surgery (yes or no)\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Statistical Analysis\n        To contrast the profiles of those who have lung cancer and those without cancer, descriptive statistics, presented as percentages for categorical data, were used. Chi-square tests were used to examine the univariate correlation between baseline characteristics and lung cancer progression. For continuous variables, mean (SD) or median (IQR) were used.\n        In this investigation, the integrated model was applied to generate a nomogram to measure the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimations of the lung cancer risk in the training set, according to the independently prognostic variables using the stepwise multivariable Cox regression (Pentry=.15 and Pstay=.10). The calibration curve was used to determine the nomogram\u2019s validity. By applying 50% and 84% quantiles, the risk predictions were grouped into the low-risk group, medium-risk group, and high-risk group, as suggested previously [50]. As per the risk prediction model, Kaplan-Meier curves were displayed for the low-risk group, medium-risk group, and high-risk group for lung cancer. The log-rank analyses were performed to compare the 3 curves. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to quantify the prediction performance of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year lung cancer risk estimations in the training set and validation set. By comparing observed and predicted probabilities, the bootstrap sampling method was used to evaluate the calibration of the current model.\n        All statistical analysis was carried out via R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) software. The nomogram was drawn using the rms package. The receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn by using the survivalROC package. Using the ggplot2 package, a calibration curve was created. All of the tests were done using 2-tailed hypotheses, and P<.05 was determined to be statistically significant.\nResults\n      \n        Characteristics of the Study Population\n        This research consisted of a total of 151,834 qualified participants with an average age of 55.34 (SD 8.65) years. The subjects were randomly separated into a training set of 75,917 and a validation set of 75,917 (Figure 1). By March 2020, 204 lung cancer cases occurred within 151,834 subjects, resulting in an incident density of 42.24 per 100,000 person-years. Lung cancer cases were more frequent in those who were older (P<.001), had a history of respiratory illness (P=.001), had a first-degree family history of lung cancer (P=.02), and had menopause (P<.001).

This model can be applied to identify and triage people at high risk for developing lung cancers among nonsmoking women.\nIntroduction\n      China has the most lung cancer death cases around the world in 2020. In 2020, according to estimates provided by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were approximately 1.80 million cases of deadly lung cancer globally. China accounted for 39.8% of these cases [1]. In China, the continuous rise in lung cancer deaths during the past 2 decades was attributed to the rising prevalence of lung cancer in women [2]. Additionally, 50% or more of lung cancers in women in Southeast Asia were diagnosed in nonsmokers [3-5]. Most of the Chinese lung cancer cases were reported to be clinically progressed in 2012-2014, with 64.6% of them being stage III-IV lung cancers [6]. The lung cancer survival rate in China, which was defined as 5 years as standard, grew up to 20% between 2003 and 2015 [7]. The prognosis of lung cancer is strongly associated with the stage in which it was detected; the 5-year survival rate ranges from 0% in cases detected in patients with stage IV cancer to >80% in cases detected in stage I and whose patients underwent surgery [8].\n      Started in 2002, the National Lung Screening Trial indicated that low-dose computed tomography screening may decrease lung cancer deaths by 20% [9]. However, this project only screened people (41% women) at high risk for lung cancer based on age and smoking history (aged 55-74 years, smoked no fewer than 30 pack-years, and had no more than 15 years of having quit smoking). Women in China have their own characteristics of lung cancer risk factor exposure and incidence patterns, the most critical of which is that although the smoking rate among women is much lower than that of high-income countries such as the United States (2.4% in China and 23.6% in the United States), the lung cancer frequencies are relatively similar (22.8/100,000 in China and 30.8/100,000 in the United States, based on the standardized lung cancer incidence rate of the world population) [10,11]. This finding shows that the existing worldwide guidelines for lung cancer screening focused on smoking as the primary predictor for high-risk individuals, which would be inappropriate for Chinese women, particularly for nonsmoking women. Therefore, determining a way that accurately forecasts the risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women and directing them toward the more cost-effective low-dose computed tomography screening is a feasible method for achieving efficient early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.\n      Earlier research has developed numerous lung cancer risk predictive models related to specific population demographics [12-41]; however, few of the predictive methods focused on nonsmoking women in mainland China [42]. Consequently, the development of lung cancer risk predicting tools for nonsmoking Chinese women according to consistently established risk factors in earlier studies has become a top goal [43]. Nevertheless, this goal is demanding and difficult. In contrast to the findings of lung cancer caused by tobacco, there are no identified risk variables for the progression of lung cancer in nonsmoking women. Although other risk factors were suggested, their relative importance varies greatly between geographical locations [3,4,44,45]. It was observed that the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) models, which included nearly 2000 Asian nonsmokers and only 7 cases of lung cancer, could be inapplicable to Asian nonsmokers [46]. Among the nonsmokers who participated in the PLCO study (n=65,711), none of them had a 6-year risk that was greater than 0.0151.\n      On the basis of the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC), we created such a model [47]. In this paper, we aimed to create and internally validate a lung cancer risk predicting model for nonsmoking Chinese women, with the focus on established risk factors for lung cancer routinely available in general cancer-screening settings.\nData Source and Subjects\n        This retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study was carried out inside the scope of CanSPUC, a continuing statewide cancer-screening program for China\u2019s urban population. CanSPUC is designed to detect the 5 most common malignancies, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, liver cancer, and female breast cancer. The CanSPUC approach was detailed in previous studies [47,48]. All of the qualified subjects were questioned by highly skilled staff to gather information about their exposure to risk variables and to assess their cancer risk using a specific cancer risk score system. The household registration system was used in local communities to identify eligible permanent residents who were aged 40-74 years and asymptomatic for lung cancer with no history of cancer diagnosis. Individuals who were unable to give informed consent, had a medical disability and were unlikely to complete curative lung cancer surgery, had a history of lung cancer, had received treatment for or had evidence of any cancer within the past 5 years (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and most in situ carcinomas), or had symptoms suggestive of lung cancer (including unexplained weight loss of >7.5 kg within the past 12 months or unexplained hemoptysis) were not eligible to participate. In October 2013, CanSPUC was implemented in Henan province, which encompassed 8 cities with complete cancer registration data (Zhengzhou, Zhumadian, Anyang, Luoyang, Nanyang, Jiaozuo, Puyang, and Xinxiang). We examined the data collected over the first 6 years (from October 2013 to October 2019) in the Henan province for our research. Only nonsmoking women were included in this investigation.\nEthics Approval\n        The Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital evaluated and authorized the research (no.2021-KY-0028-001). Our sample was drawn from retrospective encounters documented in the electronic health record; these data were deidentified for both sets of analyses and did not require informed consent.\nOutcome, Variables, and Measurements\n        All new cases of lung cancer were identified by matching with the cancer registry database in Henan province, China (by unique ID number), and histologically confirmed between October 1, 2013, and March 10, 2020. In Henan province, records of lung cancer are first submitted to local cancer registries by the hospitals and medical institutions and then submitted to the Henan Provincial Central Cancer Registry of China by the local cancer registries. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision was used to classify newly diagnosed lung malignancies by site. Lung cancers were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code of C33-C34. To find possible lung cancer risk variables, self-reported information was collected (Textbox 1).\n        \n          \n            Self-reported information collected.\n          \n          \n            \n              \nDemographic factors, such as age, ethnicity, educational status, marital status, height, and body weight\n\n              \n                \n                  A low-educational level was defined as elementary school or less, a medium educational level as junior or senior high school, and a high-educational level as college or above\n                \n                \n                  According to the \u201cGuidelines for the Prevention and Control of Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Adults,\u201d BMI was dependent on the individual\u2019s height as well as weight and segmented to \u201c<18.5 kg/m2,\u201d \u201c18.5-23.9 kg/m2,\u201d \u201c24.0-27.9 kg/m2,\u201d and \u201c\u226528.0 kg/m2\u201d categories [49]\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \nDietary habit\n\n              \n                \n                  Dietary intake of the following food in the past 2 years: vegetables (green-leafy plants and fungi except potatoes, sweet potatoes, and starches) <2.5 kg/week or \u22652.5 kg/week; roughage (all other grains except for white flour and rice) <0.5 kg/week or \u22650.5 kg/week; and fruit <1.25 kg/week or \u22651.25 kg/week.

Chi-square tests were used to examine the univariate correlation between baseline characteristics and lung cancer progression. For continuous variables, mean (SD) or median (IQR) were used.\n        In this investigation, the integrated model was applied to generate a nomogram to measure the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimations of the lung cancer risk in the training set, according to the independently prognostic variables using the stepwise multivariable Cox regression (Pentry=.15 and Pstay=.10). The calibration curve was used to determine the nomogram\u2019s validity. By applying 50% and 84% quantiles, the risk predictions were grouped into the low-risk group, medium-risk group, and high-risk group, as suggested previously [50]. As per the risk prediction model, Kaplan-Meier curves were displayed for the low-risk group, medium-risk group, and high-risk group for lung cancer. The log-rank analyses were performed to compare the 3 curves. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to quantify the prediction performance of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year lung cancer risk estimations in the training set and validation set. By comparing observed and predicted probabilities, the bootstrap sampling method was used to evaluate the calibration of the current model.\n        All statistical analysis was carried out via R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) software. The nomogram was drawn using the rms package. The receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn by using the survivalROC package. Using the ggplot2 package, a calibration curve was created. All of the tests were done using 2-tailed hypotheses, and P<.05 was determined to be statistically significant.\nCharacteristics of the Study Population\n        This research consisted of a total of 151,834 qualified participants with an average age of 55.34 (SD 8.65) years. The subjects were randomly separated into a training set of 75,917 and a validation set of 75,917 (Figure 1). By March 2020, 204 lung cancer cases occurred within 151,834 subjects, resulting in an incident density of 42.24 per 100,000 person-years. Lung cancer cases were more frequent in those who were older (P<.001), had a history of respiratory illness (P=.001), had a first-degree family history of lung cancer (P=.02), and had menopause (P<.001).

Consequently, we applied these parameters to construct the model.

The model yielded a greater AUC for passive smokers (1-year: 0.787, 3-year: 0.715, and 5-year: 0.745) than for nonpassive smokers (1-year: 0.741, 3-year: 0.721, and 5-year: 0.689; Figure 3). Calibration was acceptable, with very similar observed and predicted hazards (Figure 4).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            The receiver operating characteristic curves of prediction models in the training set.

Our results showed that the model has moderate discriminatory accuracy and goodness of fit for both nonpassive smokers and passive smokers.\n      Multiple lung cancer risk variables were discovered for nonsmoking women, such as passive smoking [51,52], prior lung diseases (tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and prior lung disorders [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]) [53], indoor radon [54], cooking oil fume [55], and a family history of lung cancer [56]. The established risk variables for lung cancer, such as age, a family history of lung cancer, and a history of chronic respiratory disease, are similar to the findings. Age is the most important risk variable for lung cancer in nonsmoking women according to our survey, which found that the risk was more than 2.4 times higher in the age group of 65-69 years than 40-44 years.\n      Menopause was associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer, with an overall odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI 0.90-1.96), according to a pooled analysis of nested case-control data [57], which is consistent with our findings. Interestingly, we found that women with a history of benign breast disease were less likely to develop lung cancer, possibly because these women may be more careful about their lifestyle and diet after developing breast disease than those who did not. This finding will need to be validated in future studies.\n      Besides the accurate indicators, risk predicting models should achieve performance standards for discrimination (the differentiation capacity to distinguish lung cancer cases from control ones) and calibration (defined as the consistency between observed and predicted risk for lung cancer). Since 2010, the substantial growth in the numbers of investigations on lung cancer risk predicting models shows the necessity of using predictive models to drive population triage. Initially, models, such as the Bach model [12], Spitz model [13], Liverpool Lung Project model [14], and PLCOM2012 model [58], emphasized the importance of applying the classic epidemiological risk variables, including age, smoking history, personal history of disease, and family history of cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the few studies to model the prediction of lung cancer risk among nonsmoking Chinese women. Due to the fact that each model was created in a distinct population with different baseline risks and lengths of follow-up, it is challenging to compare the discriminating performance of risk predictive models. The discriminating ability of every model was quite equal, with C-statistics ranging between 0.72 and 0.86. Compared to prior research, our models showed comparable predictive performance.\n      In understanding our findings, certain strengths and limitations should be carefully considered. Our research is conducted on a large population-based cancer-screening program in mainland China, which is a strong point. In addition, the variables included in this model could be easily collected and updated without any imaging, sophisticated testing, or calculation. Furthermore, the model will be used as a convenient method to triage high-risk people among nonsmoking women, and it will be involving in public health initiatives, such as recommendations regarding the control of lung cancer in nonsmokers. Nonetheless, the statistics based on self-report may be susceptible to social acceptability bias as well as recall bias. Since data collection and quality control were carried out to a high standard, the vast volume of information can be relied upon. Second, the performance of our risk-predicting model was not validated against an external data set before it was used. The findings of the internal calibration, on the other hand, suggest that this model will function satisfactorily when applied to a variety of populations.\n      In conclusion, a large-scale lung cancer\u2013screening project in China served as the foundation for the creation and internal calibration of a straightforward risk predictive model for lung cancer in nonsmoking women. The model has moderate discrimination and could be used as a tool for triaging high-risk people to prevent lung cancer in nonsmoking women. To validate the concept in external populations, additional prospective studies are needed.\nData Availability\n        The data sets for this manuscript are not publicly available because all our data are under regulation of both the National Cancer Center of China and The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital.
