Previous study has reported that silencing PRMT5 arrested cell proliferation at G1 phase.11 In addition, CDK4/cyclin D1 complex regulated PRMT5 kinase activity by phosphorylation of MEP5012 and PRMT5 promoted liver cancer cell growth through inhibiting BTG2 expression and up\u2010regulation of cyclin E1 and cyclin D1.9 Furthermore, CDT1 was methylated and stabilized by PRMT5, which promoted cells entry into S phase.12 Transcriptional factor E2F, a key cell cycle regulator, was involved in cell\u2010cycle progression and led to cells entry from G1\u2010 to S\u2010phase.13 E2F1 was directly methylated by PRMT5 and the methylation of E2F1 by PRMT5 was required for regulating E2F1\u2019s biochemical and functional properties,14 indicating that arginine methylation resulted in cell\u2010cycle progression affected by E2F1. Protein kinase B (also named Akt) is required for different cellular processes, from the regulation of cell cycle, survival and growth to control of cell metabolism.10 Dysfunction of Akt is implicated in various human cancers, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease and autoimmune disorders.10 Previously published study has shown that PRMT5 activated Akt by inducing hyperphosphorylation of the upstream positive regulator PI3K and hypophosphorylation of the negative regulator PTEN.3 However, this study did not investigate how PRMT5 induces Akt activation and the underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown.",

    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a highly lethal and aggressive malignant tumour, is the most common type of human lung cancer. The NSCLC is the first leading cause of cancer death and the most frequently diagnosed cancer in China. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and combination therapy are the main treatment options for lung cancer patients. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effects of those treatments are still poor and the mortality of NSCLC patients remains unacceptably high.1 Most lung cancer patients cannot be cured with currently available therapeutic methods. Thus, looking for new targets for NSCLC therapy is urgently needed.\n      Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is the type II arginine methyltransferase that catalyses the symmetrical dimethylation of protein substrates at the arginine residues. Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that PRMT5 is involved in a variety of biological processes via different signalling axis, such as modification of histones and gene expression, chromatin reconstruction, protein modification, cell cycle progression, cell invasion, cell metabolism and development.2 In addition to these functions, PRMT5 plays a pivotal role in regulation of cancer cell growth and transformation. It has been reported that down\u2010regulation of PRMT5 by RNAi prevented cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle transition through PI3K/Akt signalling pathway3 and a large number of corroborating studies have shown that PRMT5 expression level was significantly elevated in various cancers, including gastric,4 colorectal,5 lung,3 lymphoma,6 leukaemia7 and liver8 cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of PRMT5 regulation of PI3K/Akt signalling axis is completely unknown.\n      In this study, our results revealed that PRMT5 was overexpressed in human lung cancer cell lines and human lung cancer tissues. Stable knockdown of PRMT5 or treatment of PRMT5 specific inhibitor in A549 and H1299 cells dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and decreased cyclin E1 and D1 expression. Additionally, PRMT5 promoted lung cancer cell proliferation through direct interaction with Akt and regulation of Akt activity, but not interaction with PTEN and mTOR. Our findings suggest that PRMT5 is a key regulator for human lung cancer cell proliferation and identifying PRMT5 downstream targets will aid in illustrating the role of PRMT5 in human lung cancer development.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Cell culture and chemicals\n        Primary human foetal lung fibroblast cells (IMR90, normal cells) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, cat# F2442).

As shown in Figure 1A,B, PRMT5 was overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines compared with normal human foetal lung fibroblast cells (IMR90). This result suggests that PRTM5 is involved in human lung tumorigenesis. In order to further confirm our results, the human lung cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were used to detect PRMT5 mRNA and protein expression level. As shown in Figure 1C\u2010E, PRMT5 mRNA and protein expression level was markedly increased in lung cancer tissues compared with normal lung tissues. Taken together, these results imply that PRMT5 plays a pivotal role in human lung cancer progression.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            PRMT5 is overexpressed in human lung cancer cells and tissues.

As shown in Figure 2A,B, the PRMT5 mRNA expression level was significantly reduced both in A549 and H1299 cells compared with scramble group. We also detected PRMT5 protein expression level by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 2C\u2010F, PRMT5 protein expression level was markedly decreased both in A549 and H1299 cells compared with scramble group. Thus, these PRMT5 stable knockdown cells were used for next experiments.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Knockdown of PRMT5 suppresses proliferation of lung cancer cells.

As shown in Figure 2G,H, cell proliferation was dramatically blocked when PRMT5 was down\u2010regulated both in A549 and H1299 cells during the different time points. These results indicate that PRMT5 is involved in human lung cancer cell proliferation. Previous study has reported that PRMT5 promoted liver cancer cell growth through inhibiting BTG2 expression and the up\u2010regulation of cyclin E1 and cyclin D1.9 Therefore, we asked if down\u2010regulation of PRTM5 could reduce cyclin E1 and cyclin D1 expression in lung cancer cells. As expected, cyclin E1 and cyclin D1 expression was significantly decreased both in A549 and H1299 cells when PRMT5 was knocked down (Figure 2I\u2010K). These results indicate that PRMT5 regulates lung cancer cell proliferation via control of cell cycle progression.\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        Inhibition of PRMT5 activity suppresses lung cancer cell proliferation\n        To further investigate the role of PRMT5 in lung cancer cell proliferation, we used PRTM5 specific inhibitor, GSK591, to black PRMT5 activity and cell proliferation was evaluated. We found that proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells was markedly reduced in a dose dependent manner, whereas proliferation of IMR90 cells was almost no change (Figure 3A,B), indicating that this inhibitor has selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells. Next, the cell cycle proteins, cyclin E1 and cyclin D1, in A549 and H1299 cells were assessed upon the treatment of GSK591. We found that cyclin E1 and cyclin D1 expression level was significantly decreased both in A549 and H1299 cells (Figure 3C\u2010E). Taken together, these results suggest that blocking PRMT5 activity can prevent lung cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Blocking PRMT5 by GSK591 represses proliferation of lung cancer cell.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is completely unknown. Previous study has reported that PRMT5 up\u2010regulated cyclin\u2010dependent kinase and PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.3 Nevertheless, this study only performed ectopic expression of PRMT5 in 293T cells and there was no information about how PRTM5 regulated PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. To investigate whether PRMT5 directly interacted with Akt, immunofluorescence was used to observe the co\u2010localization between PRMT5 and activated Akt. As shown in Figure 4A, endogenous PRMT5 (Red) was co\u2010localized with activated Akt (p\u2010Ser473\u2010Akt, green) in the cell surface in A549 cells. This result indicates that PRMT5 may directly regulate Akt activity. If PRMT5 indeed regulates Akt activation, PRMT5 may directly interact with Akt. To this end, the co\u2010immunoprecipitation was used to determine whether PRMT5 directly interact with endogenous Akt in A549 cells. As shown in Figure 4B, PRMT5 was strongly interacted with Akt, but this interaction was significantly diminished when Akt was down\u2010regulated by shRNA. Similarly, Akt was strongly interacted with PRMT5 as well, but the interaction was dramatically impaired when PRMT5 was down\u2010regulated by shRNA (Figure 4C). We also performed the co\u2010immunoprecipitation between PRMT5 and PTEN or mTOR, respectively. However, there is no interaction between PRMT5 and PTEN or mTOR (Figure 4D,E). Similar results were obtained from H1299 cells, including co\u2010localization (Figure 4F) and interaction (Figure 4G\u2010J) between PRMT5 and Akt. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PRMT5 directly interact with Akt but no PTEN or mTOR in human lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            PRMT5 directly interacts with Akt in lung cancer cells.

As shown in Figure 5A\u2010C, Akt phosphorylation (Thr308 and Ser473) and the Akt downstream target GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation (Ser9) was markedly decreased when PRMT5 was knocked down both in A549 and H1299 cells, but PTEN and mTOR phosphorylation (Ser2442) did not change. We also examined the effect of PRMT5 inhibitor GSK591 on the Akt activity. As shown in Figure 5D\u2010F, Akt phosphorylation (Thr308 and Ser473) and GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation (Ser9) was significantly reduced when A549 and H1299 cells were treated with GSK591, whereas the PTEN and mTOR phosphorylation (Ser2442) did not change, indicating that PRMT5 regulation of Akt activity seems to be independent of PTEN and mTOR. To further confirm our results, the in vitro Akt kinase assay was performed both in A549 and H1299 cells. As shown in Figure 5G,H, the GSK3\u03b1 phosphorylation (Ser21) was strikingly reduced when PRMT5 was down\u2010regulated by shRNA compared with scramble group, indicating that Akt activity was impaired and PRMT5 is required for Akt activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PRMT5 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation through regulation of Akt activity, but not PTEN and mTOR signalling pathway.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            PRMT5 regulates Akt activation in lung cancer cell.

As shown in Figure 5I,J, PRMT5 expression level was markedly up\u2010regulated in lung cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Moreover, concomitant with up\u2010regulation of PRMT5 protein expression level, the Akt phosphorylation (Thr308 and Ser473) was also dramatically enhanced. This result further implies that PRMT5 is participated in human lung cancer progression through the regulation of Akt activity.\n3.1\n        PRMT5 is highly expressed in human lung cancer cells and tissues\n        To investigate the functions of PRMT5 in human lung cancer, we firstly examined the PRMT5 protein expression level in different human lung cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 1A,B, PRMT5 was overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines compared with normal human foetal lung fibroblast cells (IMR90). This result suggests that PRTM5 is involved in human lung tumorigenesis.

Moreover, concomitant with up\u2010regulation of PRMT5 protein expression level, the Akt phosphorylation (Thr308 and Ser473) was also dramatically enhanced. This result further implies that PRMT5 is participated in human lung cancer progression through the regulation of Akt activity.\n4\n      DISCUSSION\n      To date, it is clear that PRMT5 is an oncoprotein and plays a pivotal role in various human cancer progressions through the regulation of different signalling cascades. However, it is still unclear whether PRMT5 interacts with Akt, another important oncoprotein in human cancers, and regulates Akt activity in human lung cancer. The findings in this study showed that PRMT5 was overexpressed in human lung cancer cells (Figure 1). This phenomenon was further assessed in the analysis of human lung cancer tissues, in which we detected ectopic expression level of PRMT5 in human lung cancer tissues and very low expression level of PRMT5 in adjacent lung tissues (Figure 1). In addition, we uncovered that down\u2010regulation of PRMT5 by shRNA or blocking PRMT5 activity by specific inhibitor markedly prevented proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells (Figures 2 and 3). Our findings also revealed that PRMT5 was directly co\u2010localized and interacted with Akt and PRMT5 regulated Akt kinase activity both in A549 and H1299 cells (Figures 4 and 5). These results implied that PRMT5 expression level and its downstream targets could be served as novel candidates for human lung cancer therapy. Our findings raise the possibility that PRMT5 promotes human lung cancer cell proliferation via direct interaction and regulation of Akt activation.\n      Previous study has reported that silencing PRMT5 arrested cell proliferation at G1 phase.11 In addition, CDK4/cyclin D1 complex regulated PRMT5 kinase activity by phosphorylation of MEP5012 and PRMT5 promoted liver cancer cell growth through inhibiting BTG2 expression and up\u2010regulation of cyclin E1 and cyclin D1.9 Furthermore, CDT1 was methylated and stabilized by PRMT5, which promoted cells entry into S phase.12 Transcriptional factor E2F, a key cell cycle regulator, was involved in cell\u2010cycle progression and led to cells entry from G1\u2010 to S\u2010phase.13 E2F1 was directly methylated by PRMT5 and the methylation of E2F1 by PRMT5 was required for regulating E2F1\u2019s biochemical and functional properties,14 indicating that arginine methylation resulted in cell\u2010cycle progression affected by E2F1. All these observations suggest that PRMT5 is essential for cell proliferation via regulation of cell cycle progression and that PRMT5 is an important upstream effector for cancer cell growth. In this study, we showed that cyclin E1 and cyclin D1 expression was significantly decreased in both A549 and H1299 cells when PRMT5 was down\u2010regulated or blocked by GSK591 (Figures 2I and 3C). Our findings not only validate that PRMT5 regulates cells proliferation via control of cell cycle, but also indicate that PRMT5 is a key regulator for human lung cancer cell growth.\n      Protein kinase B (also named Akt) is required for different cellular processes, from the regulation of cell cycle, survival and growth to control of cell metabolism.10 Dysfunction of Akt is implicated in various human cancers, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease and autoimmune disorders.10 Previously published study has shown that PRMT5 activated Akt by inducing hyperphosphorylation of the upstream positive regulator PI3K and hypophosphorylation of the negative regulator PTEN.3 However, this study did not investigate how PRMT5 induces Akt activation and the underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown. On the other hand, there is no evidence that PRMT5 activates Akt in human lung cancer cells, although Wei et\u00a0\u00a0al reported that overexpression of PRMT5 induced Akt activation (phosphorylation) in 293T cells. In this study, we showed that PRMT5 was directly co\u2010localized and interacted with Akt and that PRMT5 regulated Akt kinase activity both in A549 and H1299 cells (Figures 4 and 5). Wei et\u00a0\u00a0al also reported that GFP\u2010PRMT5 overexpression dramatically elevated mTOR phosphorylation (S2448), which contributed to regulate Akt activation by PRMT5.3 However, we did not observe any difference in PTEN, p\u2010mTOR and total mTOR expression levels when PRMT5 was down\u2010regulated by shRNA or PRMT5 activity was blocked by specific inhibitor both in A549 and H1299 cells. Akt activation resulted in phosphorylation of many downstream targets, including mTOR/eIF4E15 and GSK3\u03b2 (Ser9).16 EIF4E and GSK3\u03b2 is the positive and negative effector of cyclin D1, respectively.17, 18, 19, 20 That is why PRMT5 can induce cyclin D1 expression through the regulation of Akt/eIF4E and Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signalling pathways. All these observations indicate that PRMT5 promotes human lung cancer cells proliferation by interaction with Akt and regulation of Akt kinase activity, which further lead to the activation or inhibition of key downstream targets of Akt by phosphorylation.\n      In summary, our results revealed that PRMT5 was frequently overexpressed in human lung cancer cells and tissues. Silencing PRMT5 or blocking PRMT5 activity prevented lung cancer cell growth and proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest. Moreover, PRMT5 directly co\u2010localized and interacted with Akt but not PTEN or mTOR and down\u2010regulation of PRMT5 decreased Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity. These results strongly imply that PRMT5 may serve as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of human lung cancer. More importantly, the new insights into the activation of Akt medicated by PRMT5 provide much new information for the mechanisms of carcinogenic effect of PRMT5 in human lung cancer.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      All the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.",
