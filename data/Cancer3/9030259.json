Stanton Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether three facets of lung cancer stigma (internalized stigma, constrained disclosure, and perceived subtle discrimination) uniquely predicted psychological and physical health-related adjustment to lung cancer across 12 weeks. Results: At study entry, higher internalized stigma, constrained disclosure, and perceived subtle discrimination were associated significantly and uniquely with higher depressive symptoms (all p < .05). Higher self-compassion significantly moderated relationships between perceived discrimination and psychological health outcomes at study entry as well as between internalized stigma and increasing depressive symptoms across 12 weeks (all p < .05).",

    "description": "Objective:\n          The aim of this study was to investigate whether three facets of lung cancer stigma (internalized stigma, constrained disclosure, and perceived subtle discrimination) uniquely predicted psychological and physical health-related adjustment to lung cancer across 12 weeks. Additionally, self-compassion was tested as a moderator of the stigma-health relationship.\nMethod:\n          Adults receiving oncologic treatment for lung cancer (N = 108) completed measures of lung cancer stigma, self-compassion, depressive symptoms, cancer-related stress, and physical symptom bother. Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships (at 6- and 12-week follow-up) between indicators of stigma and health-related outcomes, controlling for covariates. Self-compassion was tested as a moderator of these relationships.\nResults:\n          At study entry, higher internalized stigma, constrained disclosure, and perceived subtle discrimination were associated significantly and uniquely with higher depressive symptoms (all p < .05). Constrained disclosure and perceived subtle discrimination were also associated significantly with higher cancer-related stress and higher physical symptom bother at study entry (all p < .05). Furthermore, higher internalized stigma predicted significant increases in depressive symptoms across 12 weeks and in cancer-related stress across 6 and 12 weeks (all p < .05). Higher self-compassion significantly moderated relationships between perceived discrimination and psychological health outcomes at study entry as well as between internalized stigma and increasing depressive symptoms across 12 weeks (all p < .05).\nConclusions:\n          Results indicated robust relationships between distinct facets of stigma and health-related adjustment to lung cancer. Supportive care programs that bolster self-compassion may be useful for reducing lung cancer stigma.",
