CAF is one of the major types of tumor stromal cells and plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis.8 In our previous study, we isolated and grew CAF from lung cancer specimens, and demonstrated that CAF promote metastasis and EMT of lung cancer cells via IL\u20106 secretion and JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation.11 This finding prompted us to further investigate the role of CAF in drug resistance. The main mechanisms of cisplatin resistance include decreased drug absorption and increased drug efflux, mutations of drug targeted genes, enhanced DNA repair capacity, increased cell proliferation and activation of anti\u2013apoptotic signaling pathways.27 Because the ultimate goal of cisplatin and most chemotherapeutic drugs is to induce apoptosis of tumor cells, the evasion of apoptosis becomes a key feature of acquired cisplatin resistance in tumor cells.28 Survivin is a member of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), which is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis.29 Inhibition of survivin expression by a small molecule may sensitize ovarian cancer stem cells to paclitaxel,30 silencing survivin by RNAi to promote 5\u2010fluorouracil to eliminate colorectal cancer stem cells.31 Lyu et\u00a0al32 report that miR\u2010542\u20103p overcomes HER3 signaling\u2010induced chemoresistance to paclitaxel by targeting survivin in HER2\u2010overexpressing breast cancer.",

    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor worldwide, with the highest morbidity and mortality. There are approximately 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually, which account for 19% of all cancer deaths.1 Non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major pathological subtype of lung cancer, and 80%\u201085% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC. Nearly 70% of NSCLC patients present with advanced stage at the time of diagnosed,2 leaving chemotherapy as the main treatment strategy. Currently, platinum\u2010based chemotherapy the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC. However, clinical drug resistance remains a major issue, and the overall survival rate for NSCLC patients has not improved over the past three decades. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of drug resistance is crucial for better treatment of cancer patients.\n      Many factors contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancer. The genetic and epigenetic abnormity of cancer cells is the most commonly\u2010studied mechanism underlying drug resistance.3 Interestingly, recent studies have shown that not only the tumor cells themselves but also the tumor microenvironment (TME) may provide a protective niche for cancer cells from chemotherapy and lead to drug resistance.4, 5, 6\n\n      The TME consists of extracellular matrix (ECM), certain types of cells such as fibroblasts, neuroendocrine cells, adipose cells, immune\u2010inflammatory cells, as well as the blood and lymphatic vascular networks.7 CAF are among the major stromal cells in the TME. Although the origin of CAF is still under debate, accumulating evidence shows that several types of cells, including resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow\u2010derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, epithelial cells and endothelial cells, are possible predecessors of CAF.8\n\n      Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts can provide pro\u2013survival signaling to the adjacent tumor cells by producing growth factors, such as platelet\u2010derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) and stromal cell\u2010derived factor\u20101 (SDF\u20101), in a paracrine manner.9, 10 However, the role of CAF in lung cancer chemoresistance has not been elucidated. In the present study, we have explored the effect of CAF on cisplatin resistance of lung cancers. We found that CAF decrease the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells through inhibiting cisplatin\u2010induced apoptosis by activating the ANXA3/JNK pathway.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Reagents and antibodies\n        Cisplatin (CDDP) was purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).

The secondary antibodies coupled to HRP were purchased from ZSGB\u2010BIO (Beijing, China). Recombinant Human ANXA3 was purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA). ANXA3 neutralizing antibody was purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Cell culture\n        Human lung cancer cell lines A549, H661 and SK\u2010MES\u20101 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were grown and maintained in DMEM medium (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Medium was supplemented with 10% FBS.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Isolation and culture of stromal fibroblasts\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts were isolated from primary tumor tissue as previously described.11 CAF were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. For the preparation of CAF\u2010conditioned medium (CAF\u2010CM), CAF were cultured for 48\u00a0hours; the CAF\u2010CM was collected and centrifuged for 10\u00a0minutes at 1500 g to remove cell debris. All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate and CAF were at <10 passages.\n        The lung cancer tissues were obtained from patients at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital (TMUGH, Tianjin, China), who underwent surgery without chemotherapy treatment history. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for the collection and use of specimens, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUGH.\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Cell viability assay\n        Cell viability was assessed by using the Cell Counting Kit\u20108 (CCK\u20108, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, lung cancer cells were plated at a density of 8\u201010\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0cells/well in a 96\u2010well plate; they were then treated with 0\u201080\u00a0\u03bcmol/L CDDP for 48\u00a0hours. Cell viability was detected by CCK\u20108, and the median inhibitory concentration IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (La Jolla, CA, USA).\n      \n      \n        2.5\n        Flow cytometric evaluation of apoptosis\n        Lung cancer cells were treated with CDDP for 24\u00a0hours. After the treatment, the apoptotic cells were determined using an Annexin V\u2010FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in binding buffer. Annexin V\u2010FITC and PI were then added to the cells, before incubation for 15\u00a0minutes at room temperature in the dark. The apoptosis analysis was performed on a FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, CA, USA).\n      \n      \n        2.6\n        RNA interference and transfection\n        The siRNA duplexes were purchased from Genepharma (Shanghai, China). The sequences of siRNA duplex for ANXA3 were: sense: 5\u2032\u2010GG\u2010 ACAAGCAGGCAAAUGAATT\u20103\u2032, anti\u2013sense: 5\u2032\u2010UUCAUUUGCUUGUCCTT\u20103\u2032. Lung cancer cells were plated into 6\u2010well plate at a density of 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0cells/well, transfected with siRNA duplexes with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, California, USA), and incubated for 48\u00a0hours before further analysis.\n        We constructed the plasmid of pcDNA3.1(+)\u2010ANXA3 ourselves. Lung cancer cells were plated into 6\u2010well plate at a density of 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0cells/well; 2\u00a0\u03bcg of pcDNA3.1(+)\u2010ANXA3 was transfected into A549 and H661 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated for 48\u00a0hours before further analysis.\n      \n      \n        2.7\n        Quantitative PCR\n        Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was performed by using a TaKaRa Kit (Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gene expressions were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detector System (ABI). The primers for ANXA3 were: forward ACAGCGGCAGCTGATTGTTA; reverse TCACTAGGGCCACCATGAGA. PCR reactions were performed as previously described,12 under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0minutes, followed by 40\u00a0cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0seconds and 60\u00b0C for 34\u00a0seconds. GAPDH was used as an internal control.\n      \n      \n        2.8\n        Western blotting\n        Western blotting was performed as previously described.13 Briefly, protein was extracted from cells using a RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). The proteins were separated by running a 12% SDS\u2010PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% non\u2013fat milk for 1.5\u00a0hours at room temperature. Then the membranes were probed with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and further incubated with the HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies at 37\u00b0C for 1.5\u00a0hours. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using the ECL Western Blotting System following the manufacturer's instructions.\n      \n      \n        2.9\n        RNA sequencing\n        Total RNA was extracted from CAF and NF using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA sequencing was conducted on a BGISEQ\u2010500 by BGI (Shenzhen, China).\n      \n      \n        2.10\n        In vivo tumor studies\n        BALB/c nude mice were obtained from the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). Xenograft experiments were conducted in accordance with the Tianjin Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Each treatment group consisted of 5 mice; 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 A549 cells or 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 A549 cells mixed with 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CAF (ratio1:3) were resuspended in 100\u2010\u03bcL PBS and injected subcutaneously into the mice. Beginning 1\u00a0week after injection, tumor masses were measured every week, and tumor volume was calculated as: volume (mm3)\u00a0=\u00a0d2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0D/2, where the d and D were the shortest and the longest diameters. When the tumor volume reached approximately 50\u00a0mm3, mice were treated with CDDP (3\u00a0mg/kg body weight), whereas the control group was treated with normal saline. After 6\u00a0weeks, mice were killed, and tumor tissues were dissected and used for mRNA and protein extraction.\n      \n      \n        2.11\n        Statistical analysis\n        The data were presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Variance analysis between multiple groups was performed by one\u2010way ANOVA. Differences between 2 groups were evaluated by Student's t\u2010test. Statistical significance was defined as P\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\n2.1\n        Reagents and antibodies\n        Cisplatin (CDDP) was purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).

CAF were isolated from lung cancer tumor specimens, as in our previous study,11 and CAF\u2010CM was collected 48\u00a0hours after culturing CAF in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium.\n        To investigate the effect of CAF on cisplatin sensitivity of lung cancer cells, A549 and H661 cells were pre\u2013incubated with CAF\u2010CM for 24\u00a0hours, DMEM medium and NF\u2010CM was used as control medium. Then cells were treated with 0\u201080\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 48\u00a0hours, and cell viability was detected by CCK\u20108 cell viability assay. CAF\u2010CM increased cisplatin resistance of A549, H661 and SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells significantly. The IC50 values of cisplatin were elevated by CAF\u2010CM, from 11.57\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (DMEM), 13.67\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (NF\u2010CM) to 30.48\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (CAF\u2010CM) in A549 cells; from 11.44\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (DMEM), 13.77\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (NF\u2010CM) to 42.10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (CAF\u2010CM) in H661 cells; and from 15.69\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (DMEM), 19.08\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (NF\u2010CM) to 41.06\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (CAF\u2010CM) in SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells, respectively (Figure\u00a01). Our data indicated that CAF\u2010CM enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells. Lung cancer cells were cultures in CAF\u2010CM and treated with 0\u201080\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 48\u00a0h. Cell viability was detected by CCK\u20108 assay. Values represent the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD from 3 independent experiments. *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts elevated the expression level of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts and NF possess different characters and play different roles, based on their gene expression profiles. We compared the mRNA expression profiles between CAF and NF by applying the RNA\u2010Sequence (RNA\u2010Seq) approach. Our RNA\u2010Seq data showed that 219 genes were upregulated in CAF compared to NF, whereas, 158 genes were downregulated in CAF compared to NF (Figure\u00a02A). The gene ontology analysis classified these modulated genes into 3 categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function (Figure\u00a02B). In the biological process category, most genes are related to cellular and single\u2010organism processes; in the cellular component category, most genes are related to cell parts and organelles; and in the single\u2010organism process category, most genes are related to binding and catalytic activity.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) elevated the expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells. A,B, Gene expression in CAF and normal fibroblasts (NF) was assessed by RNA\u2010Seq. The differential gene expression and the ontology analysis were performed. C, The expression of ANXA3 in paired CAF and NF were detected by western blotting. D, The mRNA expression of ANXA3 in paired CAF and NF were detected by quantitative PCR. E, The expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cell lines was detected by western blotting. F, The expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells cultured with CAF\u2010CM was detected by western blotting\n          \n          \n        \n        Because CAF strengthened cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells, we focused on upregulated genes that are involved in tumor development. We found that ANXA3 is upregulated in CAF. To validate the RNA\u2010Seq results, we performed western blot and qPCR analysis to determine the expression of ANXA3. Consistent with the results of RNA\u2010Seq, both protein and mRNA levels of ANXA3 were significantly elevated in CAF (Figure\u00a02C,D).\n        To determine whether CAF affect the expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells, we first examined the expression of ANXA3 in A549, H661 and SK\u2010MES\u20101 cell lines. Our results showed that ANXA3 was expressed in all 3 cell lines, and the expression level of ANXA3 in SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells was much higher than in A549 and H661 cells (Figure\u00a02E). Next, we incubated A549, H661 and SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells with CAF\u2010CM, and expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells were determined. Figure\u00a02F showed that CAF\u2010CM incubation dramatically increased the ANXA3 level in all 3 lung cancer cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels.\n        Although CAF\u2010CM incubation increased the ANXA3 level in lung cancer cells, we need to further demonstrate whether the increased ANXA3 level in cancer cells is due to ANXA3 secretion in CAF. We manipulated ANXA3 levels in CAF by overexpression or RNAi knock down. We found that when ANXA3 was overexpressed in CAF, its levels in lung cancer cells were increased accordingly (Figure\u00a03A); whereas when ANXA3 level was reduced by RNAi knockdown, its levels in lung cancer cells were also decreased (Figure\u00a03B). Furthermore, we manipulated ANXA3 levels in medium. The ANXA3 recombinant protein was added to the culture medium to mimic the ANXA3 containing CAF\u2010CM. Figure\u00a03C shows that ANXA3 recombinant protein enhanced ANXA3 levels in cancer cells. We further added the ANXA3 neutralizing antibody to CAF\u2010CM, and we found that the blockage of ANXA3 secretion in CAF attenuated ANXA3 upregulation (Figure\u00a03C). These results demonstrated that ANXA3 level increase in cancer cells via ANXA3 secretion in CAF.\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Elevated expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells was mediated by ANXA3 secretion in cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF). A,B, ANXA3 was overexpressed or knocked down in CAF, the CAF\u2010CM was collected and incubated with lung cancer cells. The expressions of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells were detected by western blotting. C, Recombinant ANXA3 was added to DMEM and incubated with lung cancer cells. The expressions of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells were detected by western blotting. ANXA3 neutralizing antibody (500\u00a0ng/mL) was added to CAF\u2010CM and incubated with lung cancer cells. The expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells was detected by western blotting\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.3\n        ANXA3 mediated the effect of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts on cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells\n        To investigate the role of ANXA3 in the enhancement of CAF on chemoresistance, the expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells was manipulated. Because A549 and H661 cells expressed lower levels of ANXA3 and SK\u2010MES\u20101 expressed higher levels of ANXA3, we overexpressed ANXA3 in A549 and H661 cells, whereas, knocked down ANXA3 expression in SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells. Lung cancer cells were then treated with cisplatin. In Figure\u00a04, it is evident that overexpression of ANXA3 dramatically enhanced drug resistance, IC50 was increased from 14.63 to 28.94\u00a0\u03bcmol/L in A549 cells, and from 11.76 to 36.83\u00a0\u03bcmol/L in H661 cells. In contrast, ANXA3 knockdown increased the sensitivity of SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells; IC50 was decreased from 21.40 to 10.23\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. Next, we added the ANXA3 neutralizing antibody to CAF\u2010CM, and we found that the blockage of ANXA3 secretion in CAF attenuated cisplatin resistance in cancer cells caused by CAF (Figure\u00a05). Collectively, these results suggested that CAF potentiate cisplatin resistance by upregulating ANXA3 expression in lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            \nANXA3 mediated the effect of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts on cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells.

JNK is a member of the MAPK family and is closely related to tumor development. This prompted us to explore the effect of CAF on JNK pathway.\n        Lung cancer cells were treated with cisplatin, with and without CAF\u2010CM pre\u2013treatment. Compared with cisplatin\u2010only treatment, CAF\u2010CM significantly increased the expression of both ANXA3 and p\u2010JNK. In contrast, CAF\u2010CM decreased the expression of apoptosis\u2010related genes cleaved caspase 8 and caspase 3, also survivin, which was activated by cisplatin (Figure\u00a06A). We further overexpressed ANXA3 in A549 and H661 cells, then treated cells with cisplatin. We found that ANXA3 elevated the p\u2010JNK level, and reduced the cleaved caspase\u20108, caspase\u20103 and survivin level, which had a similar effect as CAF. However, when ANXA3 expression was reduced by RNAi in SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells, the JNK activation was suppressed, and the effect of cisplatin on caspases activation was reversed (Figure\u00a06B).\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) activated the JNK/survivin pathway by upregulating ANXA3. A, A549 and H661 cells were incubated with CAF\u2010CM for 24\u00a0h, then treated with 15\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 36\u00a0h. The protein expressions were detected by western blotting. B, A549 and H661 cells were transfected with pANXA3. SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells were transfected with ANXA3\u2010siRNA duplex, then treated with 15\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 36\u00a0h.

We found that inhibition of JNK effectively abolished the effect of CAF or ANXA3 on the cisplatin resistance (Figure\u00a07A,B) and the activation of the JNK/survivin pathway (Figure\u00a07C) in lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 7\n          \n            \nJNK/Survivin pathway mediated the effect of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) on cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells.

Our results showed that CAF effectively protected cells from apoptosis induced by cisplatin, and inhibition of JNK by JNK specific inhibitor retarded this effect (Figure\u00a07D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that CAF enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells through activation of the JNK/survivin pathway via ANXA3 upregulation.\n      \n      \n        3.5\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells in vivo\n        To explore the effect of CAF on chemoresistance in vivo, we conducted animal experiments to evaluate the effect of CAF on tumor growth and drug resistance. A549 cells alone or combined with CAF were subcutaneously injected into mice and treated with cisplatin. For direct comparison, A549 cells alone group and A549 combined with CAF group were injected into the same mouse; A549 cells alone treated with cisplatin group and A549 plus CAF treated with cisplatin were injected into the same mouse.\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts boosted tumor growth significantly in mice; the average tumor volume of A549 cells combined with the CAF group was 2.5\u2010fold larger than for the A549 alone group after 6\u00a0weeks. As expected, cisplatin inhibited A549 cell growth in mice; interestingly, CAF dramatically enhanced tumor growth under cisplatin treatment (Figure\u00a08A,B). These results indicated that CAF enhanced tumor growth and chemoresistance.\n        \n          Figure 8\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer in vivo. 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 A549 cells, alone or with 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\nCAF (ratio1:3) were injected subcutaneously into the back of BALB/c nude mice. Mice were treated with PBS or cisplatin (3\u00a0mg/kg body weight) for 6\u00a0wk. A, At the end of treatment, tumor formation was inspected and tumors were excised. B, Tumor volumes were measured every week. C, The protein expressions in tumor tissues were detected by western blotting\n          \n          \n        \n        Next, we investigated the ANXA3 status and JNK/survivin pathway in tumors. The tumor tissues were dissected, and the ANXA3 and JNK pathway were examined by immunoblotting. Consistent with in vitro study, ANXA3 expression was increased, the level of p\u2010JNK and survivin was also elevated. On the other hand, apoptosis\u2010related genes caspase 3 and 8 was suppressed (Figure\u00a08C). These results demonstrated that CAF enhance A549 xenograft growth and cisplatin resistance, through the JNK/survivin pathway activation via ANXA3.\n3.1\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells\n        For broader interest, we chose 3 lung cancer cell lines, A549 cells (adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (large cell carcinoma) and SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells (squamous cell carcinoma), which represented different pathological subtypes of lung cancer. CAF were isolated from lung cancer tumor specimens, as in our previous study,11 and CAF\u2010CM was collected 48\u00a0hours after culturing CAF in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium.\n        To investigate the effect of CAF on cisplatin sensitivity of lung cancer cells, A549 and H661 cells were pre\u2013incubated with CAF\u2010CM for 24\u00a0hours, DMEM medium and NF\u2010CM was used as control medium. Then cells were treated with 0\u201080\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 48\u00a0hours, and cell viability was detected by CCK\u20108 cell viability assay. CAF\u2010CM increased cisplatin resistance of A549, H661 and SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells significantly. The IC50 values of cisplatin were elevated by CAF\u2010CM, from 11.57\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (DMEM), 13.67\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (NF\u2010CM) to 30.48\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (CAF\u2010CM) in A549 cells; from 11.44\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (DMEM), 13.77\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (NF\u2010CM) to 42.10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (CAF\u2010CM) in H661 cells; and from 15.69\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (DMEM), 19.08\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (NF\u2010CM) to 41.06\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (CAF\u2010CM) in SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells, respectively (Figure\u00a01). Our data indicated that CAF\u2010CM enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells.

We compared the mRNA expression profiles between CAF and NF by applying the RNA\u2010Sequence (RNA\u2010Seq) approach. Our RNA\u2010Seq data showed that 219 genes were upregulated in CAF compared to NF, whereas, 158 genes were downregulated in CAF compared to NF (Figure\u00a02A). The gene ontology analysis classified these modulated genes into 3 categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function (Figure\u00a02B). In the biological process category, most genes are related to cellular and single\u2010organism processes; in the cellular component category, most genes are related to cell parts and organelles; and in the single\u2010organism process category, most genes are related to binding and catalytic activity.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) elevated the expression of ANXA3 in lung cancer cells.

We found that inhibition of JNK effectively abolished the effect of CAF or ANXA3 on the cisplatin resistance (Figure\u00a07A,B) and the activation of the JNK/survivin pathway (Figure\u00a07C) in lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 7\n          \n            \nJNK/Survivin pathway mediated the effect of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) on cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells. A, A549 and H661 cells were cultured in CAF\u2010CM and pre\u2013treated with 2\u00a0\u03bcmol/L JNK inhibitor SP600125 for 1\u00a0h, then were treated with 0\u201040\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 48\u00a0h. Cell viability was detected by CCK\u20108 assay. B, A549 and H661 cells were transfected with pANXA3 and pre\u2013treated with 2\u00a0\u03bcmol/L SP600125 for 24\u00a0h, then were treated with 0\u201040\u00a0\u03bcmol/L cisplatin for 48\u00a0h. Cell viability was detected by CCK\u20108 assay. C, Protein expressions were detected by western blotting. D, Cells were stained with Annexin/PI after treatment and the apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Values represent the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD from 3 independent experiments. *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001\n          \n          \n        \n        Furthermore, the induction of apoptosis by cisplatin was examined by flow cytometry. Our results showed that CAF effectively protected cells from apoptosis induced by cisplatin, and inhibition of JNK by JNK specific inhibitor retarded this effect (Figure\u00a07D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that CAF enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells through activation of the JNK/survivin pathway via ANXA3 upregulation.\n3.5\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells in vivo\n        To explore the effect of CAF on chemoresistance in vivo, we conducted animal experiments to evaluate the effect of CAF on tumor growth and drug resistance. A549 cells alone or combined with CAF were subcutaneously injected into mice and treated with cisplatin. For direct comparison, A549 cells alone group and A549 combined with CAF group were injected into the same mouse; A549 cells alone treated with cisplatin group and A549 plus CAF treated with cisplatin were injected into the same mouse.\n        Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts boosted tumor growth significantly in mice; the average tumor volume of A549 cells combined with the CAF group was 2.5\u2010fold larger than for the A549 alone group after 6\u00a0weeks. As expected, cisplatin inhibited A549 cell growth in mice; interestingly, CAF dramatically enhanced tumor growth under cisplatin treatment (Figure\u00a08A,B). These results indicated that CAF enhanced tumor growth and chemoresistance.\n        \n          Figure 8\n          \n            Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer in vivo. 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 A549 cells, alone or with 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\nCAF (ratio1:3) were injected subcutaneously into the back of BALB/c nude mice. Mice were treated with PBS or cisplatin (3\u00a0mg/kg body weight) for 6\u00a0wk. A, At the end of treatment, tumor formation was inspected and tumors were excised. B, Tumor volumes were measured every week. C, The protein expressions in tumor tissues were detected by western blotting\n          \n          \n        \n        Next, we investigated the ANXA3 status and JNK/survivin pathway in tumors. The tumor tissues were dissected, and the ANXA3 and JNK pathway were examined by immunoblotting. Consistent with in vitro study, ANXA3 expression was increased, the level of p\u2010JNK and survivin was also elevated. On the other hand, apoptosis\u2010related genes caspase 3 and 8 was suppressed (Figure\u00a08C). These results demonstrated that CAF enhance A549 xenograft growth and cisplatin resistance, through the JNK/survivin pathway activation via ANXA3.\n4\n      DISCUSSION\n      Drug resistance is one of the main obstacles that both clinicians and patients have to deal with during cancer treatment. Despite the extensive studies on chemoresistance, in particular, on the use of conventional chemotherapeutic reagents such as platinum compounds and antimetabolites, the specific mechanisms that cause the tumor recurrence and progression after treatment are still poorly understood.\n      For many years, research on drug resistance has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, little is known about the role of TME in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy. CAF is one of the major types of tumor stromal cells and plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis.8 In our previous study, we isolated and grew CAF from lung cancer specimens, and demonstrated that CAF promote metastasis and EMT of lung cancer cells via IL\u20106 secretion and JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation.11 This finding prompted us to further investigate the role of CAF in drug resistance.\n      Numerous studies have shown that CAF promote drug resistance in several types of tumor, such as breast cancer,14 ovarian cancer,15 pancreatic cancer16 and colorectal cancer.17 To investigate the effect of CAF on cisplatin resistance of lung cancer, we collected the CAF\u2010CM and cultured lung cancer cells in CAF\u2010CM. We found that CAF\u2010CM dramatically affects the cisplatin sensitivity of lung cancer cells.\n      Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts can secrete CAF\u2010specific proteins, cytokines, growth factors and ECM components to support tumor cell growth, angiogenesis and confer chemoresistance.18 To identify whether the CAF\u2010secreted proteins contribute to drug resistance, we first performed RNA\u2010Seq on CAF compared to NF. Among upregulated genes in CAF, ANXA3 drew our attention. ANXA3, a member of the annexin family, binds to acidic phospholipids in a calcium\u2010dependent manner.19 Recent studies show that ANXA3 plays an important role in tumor growth and progression. Clinical evidence indicates that ANXA3 could be a potential biomarker of several types of cancers, such as bladder cancer,20 colon cancer21 and gastric cancer.22 It can also serve as an important marker for the invasion, the metastasis and the prognosis of breast cancer.23\n\n      ANXA3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissue and cell lines, and overexpression of ANXA3 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation.22 Zhou et\u00a0al24 reported that inhibition of ANXA3 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, ANXA3 also involved in chemoresistance. Sorafenib\u2010resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells and patient\u2010derived xenografts expressed a high level of ANXA3. Overexpression of ANXA3 in sorafenib\u2010resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells suppressed apoptosis, whereas anti\u2013ANXA3 monoclonal antibody potentiated the effect of sorafenib.25 The study by Pan et\u00a0al.26also showed that ANXA3 promoted the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to 5\u2010fluorouracil and cisplatin in vivo. In this study we found that the expression of ANXA3 was higher in CAF than in NF and stimulation with CAF\u2010CM can upregulate ANXA3 expression in lung cancer cells. Overexpression of ANXA3 enhanced cisplatin resistance of A549 and H661 cells, whereas suppression of ANXA3 increased cisplatin sensitivity of SK\u2010MES\u20101 cells, which suggested the important role of ANXA3 in cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells.\n      The main mechanisms of cisplatin resistance include decreased drug absorption and increased drug efflux, mutations of drug targeted genes, enhanced DNA repair capacity, increased cell proliferation and activation of anti\u2013apoptotic signaling pathways.27 Because the ultimate goal of cisplatin and most chemotherapeutic drugs is to induce apoptosis of tumor cells, the evasion of apoptosis becomes a key feature of acquired cisplatin resistance in tumor cells.28 Survivin is a member of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), which is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis.29 Inhibition of survivin expression by a small molecule may sensitize ovarian cancer stem cells to paclitaxel,30 silencing survivin by RNAi to promote 5\u2010fluorouracil to eliminate colorectal cancer stem cells.31 Lyu et\u00a0al32 report that miR\u2010542\u20103p overcomes HER3 signaling\u2010induced chemoresistance to paclitaxel by targeting survivin in HER2\u2010overexpressing breast cancer. Our results showed that CAF\u2010CM upregulated survivin expression, and decreased the activity of caspase 8/3, which are the key executioners of apoptosis in lung cancer cells, suggesting that CAF enhanced cisplatin resistance of NSCLC cells by inhibiting apoptosis induced by cisplatin.\n      To further explore the mechanism underlying the promoting effect of CAF on cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cell, we explored the signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. MAPK is an important intracellular signaling system which is responsible for transmitting various extracellular signals into the cells. It regulates a variety of physiological processes, including metabolism, survival, cell division and apoptosis.33, 34 JNK is a member of the MAPK family; it plays a controversial roles in drug resistance. Platinum continuously activates JNK to reduce drug\u2010induced apoptosis, and inhibition of JNK activation increases the drug sensitivity of small cell lung cancer.35 Rincon et\u00a0al36 found that inactivation of JNK by mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 determines resistance of breast cancer cells to taxanes and anthracyclines. In contrast, Davila\u2010Gonzalez et\u00a0al37 reported that JNK activation contributed to docetaxel response of triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC) when nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was inhibited. We found that CAF activated the JNK signaling pathway, leading to the enhanced cisplatin resistance of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.\n      In summary, our study showed that CAF significantly enhanced cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. We further demonstrated that CAF potentiated chemoresistance by suppressing cisplatin induced apoptosis by activating the ANXA3/JNK signaling pathway (Figure\u00a09). Targeting tge ANXA3/JNK signaling pathway could be a novel strategy to overcome lung cancer resistance to cisplatin and merits further clinical evaluation.\n      \n        Figure 9\n        \n          A proposed model of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts enhanced cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells\nDISCLOSURE\n      There are no conflicts of interest to disclose.",
