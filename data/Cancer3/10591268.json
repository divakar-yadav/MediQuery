SAMPLE & SETTING: 266 patients with lung cancer treated at two National Cancer Institute\u2013designated comprehensive cancer centers in the United States. RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, lower levels of patient advocacy were reported by older patients and those with higher levels of constrained disclosure (i.e., avoidance of or discomfort in disclosing one\u2019s lung cancer status).",

Demographic, clinical, and stigma-related correlates of advocacy were also explored.\nRESULTS:\n          In multivariable analyses, lower levels of patient advocacy were reported by older patients and those with higher levels of constrained disclosure (i.e., avoidance of or discomfort in disclosing one\u2019s lung cancer status).\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING:\n          Avoidance of discussing lung cancer (constrained disclosure) may be a barrier to patient involvement in advocacy. Additional research is needed to examine this relationship, reduce stigma, and promote inclusivity for individuals with lung cancer.",
