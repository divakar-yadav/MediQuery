    "description": "1\n      Introduction\n      Lung cancer represents the leading cause of death by malignant diseases, worldwide [1]. Different genomic and genetic alterations pertaining to the hallmarks of cancer determine the initiation, promotion, histopathological transformation, and malignant progression of lung cancer. The role of long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) has also been explored, particularly in terms of failure in genetic transcription and/or epigenetic regulation, which have been described as modulated functional archetypes of these molecules [2, 3]. LncRNAs are described as noncodifying RNA molecules greater than 200 nucleotides [4], and several LncRNAs have been known to act as oncogenes, promoting the development and/or progression of lung cancer [5, 6, 7, 8].\n      LncRNA SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2\u2010OT) is transcribed from two transcription start sites, both in normal embryological development as well as during lung cancer oncogenesis. SOX2\u2010OT represents a 3.4\u2010kb\u2010long transcript, derived from 10 exon units, and produces 6 postsplicing genetic variants. Both SOX2\u2010OT and, its genome neighbor, transcriptional factor of pluripotency SRY\u2010Box Transcription Factor (SOX2), are transcribed on the same genetic positive direction [9, 10], suggesting a coordinated genetic co\u2010expression pattern. Furthermore, experimental evidence supports that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT modulates the expression of SOX2 during the embryonic stage as well as during cancer development [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT appears to have a relevant role in several malignant diseases including osteosarcoma [16], ovarian cancer [17], gastric cancer [18], hepatocellular carcinoma [19], cholangiocarcinoma [14], esophageal squamous cell carcinomas [20], multiple myeloma [21], bladder cancer [15], and lung cancer [22]. Evidence has shown that SOX2\u2010OT is involved in mechanisms pertaining to cell cycle regulation, tumor cell proliferation and malignant invasion [22, 23, 24]. Furthermore, SOX2\u2010OT has been proposed as a ncRNA biomarker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in patients with malignant lung diseases [25, 26], highlighting that SOX2\u2010OT is associated with poor patient survival, probably by promoting epigenetic aberrations in lung cancer [22].\n      However, several important aspects remain unknown, including whether co\u2010 and overexpression of SOX2\u2010OT and SOX2 might impact clinically relevant outcomes, including disease progression and response to therapy. The role of SOX2\u2010OT as a possible epigenetic regulator of the SOX2 gene promoter has also remained unexplored. Last, the impact at post\u2010translational level on molecular intermediary members of the EGFR intracellular signaling pathway, as a targeted therapy, has not been described.\n      The SOX2 gene has been shown to possess transcriptional ability to regulate the expression of the GLI\u20101 gene [27], participating as a member of the Sonic Hedgehog (Sh) pathway in cancer therapy resistance mechanisms of lung neoplasms [28]. Based on the aforementioned information, we conducted the present study which sought to provide information regarding the role of SOX2\u2010OT in modulating gene expression of SOX2 as well as its effect in lung cancer therapy resistance and clinical outcomes.\n      We hypothesized that the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 molecular axis is involved as a resistance mechanism in lung cancer therapy, and that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT acts as an epigenetic regulator of the genetic expression of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 genes, involved in resistance mechanisms to lung cancer therapy agents, including cisplatin and EGRF\u2010tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib.\n2\n      Materials and methods\n      \n        2.1\n        Human lung cancer cell lines, cellular cultures, and lung cancer samples\n        Human wild\u2010type (EGFR and KRAS mutation) lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549, G12C and NCI\u2010H2347, G57T) and mutant EGFR cell lines (NCI\u2010H1975, L858R/T790M and HCC827 [delE746\u2010A750]) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (University Boulevard, Manassas, VA, USA). All cells were grown in RPMI\u20101640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Riverside, MO, USA), and 1% ampicillin/streptomycin (Biowest). The cells were cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n        Tissue samples from human lung carcinomas were obtained from subjects with advanced non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who attended the Thoracic Oncology Unit at the National Cancer Institute (INCan) in Mexico City from 2005 to 2008. A total of 33 samples were obtained for LncRNA and mRNA expression analysis. Twenty\u2010three samples (n\u00a0=\u00a023/33) were obtained from patients who had been exposed to known risk factors, including tobacco smoking and/or wood smoke exposure (Risk Smoking Lung Tumors subgroup), while 10 samples (n\u00a0=\u00a010/33) were obtained from subjects without exposure to these risk factors (Nonrisk Smoking Lung Tumors subgroup). Last three normal, nonmalignant, lung tissue samples were obtained for comparative purposes.\n        Another set of tissue samples (40 lung carcinomas and 25 nonmalignant normal lung tissue) were obtained for the protein co\u2010expression analyses. The LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT expression was performed using an additional cohort of lung carcinoma tissue samples from 16 patients, and an additional five normal, nonmalignant lung tissue samples for comparative purposes. These last samples were obtained from the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), Ismael Cos\u00edo Villegas. All experiments using human specimens were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and were approved by the Institutional Review Committees for INER (B17\u201007, B09\u201008, C61\u201016), and INCAN (008102510M1, CB451). All patients provided written informed consent for the surgical resection of the tissue sample and for its future use in genetic/epigenetic research studies.\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Oncological treatment\n        The EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (Toluca, Mexico). Erlotinib was dissolved in DMSO, the final concentration of DMSO was 2.5% in medium. Cisplatin was dissolved in medium culture. Human lung adenocarcinoma cells were seeded in 10\u00a0cm dishes to attach overnight. Briefly we obtained the IC25 of TKI\u2010erlotinib (TKI\u2010ER) and cisplatin (CisPlat) for each cell line. The next day, cells were treated with the IC25 of each drug according to cell line (A549: TKI\u2010ER: 10.10\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 2.76\u00a0\u00b5m, NCI\u2010H2347: TKI\u2010ER: 5.16\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 1.267\u00a0\u00b5m, NCI\u2010H1975: TKI\u2010ER: 14.785\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 1.735\u00a0\u00b5m and HCC827: TKI\u2010ER: 15\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 1.152\u00a0\u00b5m). Cells were harvested for futures assays after 12, 48, and 120\u00a0h of incubation.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        RNA isolation and RT\u2010qPCR assays\n        Total RNA was isolated from parental human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, cell cultures with different treatment conditions and human lung cancer tissue samples, using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration for RNA was evaluated by spectrophotometry using an UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Implen NanoPhotometer\u2122 NP80, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) . One microgram of total RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis with random hexamers using RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Mix\u2010Control was used for baseline expression for cancer cell lines in baseline conditions. The mix\u2010Control contained equimolar amounts of total RNA from cancer cell lines. The expression profiles of LncRNAs and mRNAs were determined by quantitative PCR using SYBR Green (RealQ Plus Master Mix; AMPLIQON, Odense M, Denmark), with U1 as internal control for LncRNAs and GAPDH as internal control for mRNAs. The PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table\u00a0S1. The conditions for qPCR were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of amplification: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. Melt curve: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, and 97\u00a0\u00b0C continuous. The qPCR was carried out using the LightCycler 480 System Real\u2010TiME PCR instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Differences in relative expression were calculated using the 2\u2010\u0394\u0394Ct or 2\u2010\u0394Ct method. All reactions were performed in experimental triplicates.\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Transient transfection (siRNA)\n        For transfection assays, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 A549 (wild\u2010type) and NCI\u2010H1975 (EGFR\u2010mutated) lung cancer cells were plated in 6\u2010well plates overnight and transfected with 50\u00a0ng of SOX2\u2010OT siRNA (siOT1 and siOT2) and equimolar amounts of siRNA siOT1/siOT2 (siMix) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The target sequence for SOX2\u2010OT siRNA has been previously reported [22]. Nontargeting SOX2\u2010OT RNA siRNA was used as a control (Control siRNA\u2010A/sc\u201037007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Sequences are provided in Table\u00a0S2. Cells were harvested 48\u00a0h after transfection for future assays.\n      \n      \n        2.5\n        Western blot analysis\n        Cell cultures with different treatment conditions were lysed in RIPA buffer (HEPES\u2010KOH 1\u00a0m pH 7.5, NaCl 5\u00a0m, EDTA 0.5\u00a0m pH 8, Triton X\u2010100 20%, Sodium Deoxycholate 10%, SDS 20%) containing proteinase inhibitors (complete Mini, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio\u2010Rad DC\u2122 Protein Assay kit (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and absorbance was determined by a multiwell spectrophotometer (Epoch, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), at 750\u00a0nm. For western blot analysis, 30\u00a0\u00b5g of protein was separated by 10% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio\u2010Rad). Blocking was performed at room temperature for 2\u00a0h in TBS\u2010T with 5% milk (Blotting\u2010Grade Blocker; Bio\u2010Rad), followed by overnight incubation with different primary antibodies at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Primary antibodies against the following proteins and dilutions were used: GLI\u20101: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500 (Abcam, Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK), SOX2: 1\u00a0:\u00a02000 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), GAPDH: 1\u00a0:\u00a03000 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), p\u2010AKT: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500, t\u2010AKT: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), p\u2010ERK: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500, and t\u2010ERK: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500 (Cell Signaling Technology). After primary antibody incubation overnight, washing and incubation with secondary antibodies was performed: anti\u2010mouse or anti\u2010rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology), at 1\u00a0:\u00a010\u00a0000 dilution. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Clarity\u2122 Western ECL Substrate; Bio\u2010Rad). GAPDH was used as loading control. The intensities of protein levels were analyzed using imagej software (Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).\n      \n      \n        2.6\n        Cellular viability (MTS assays)\n        EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO as stock solution at 10\u00a0mm. Cisplatin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was dissolved in NaCI 0.9% as stock solution at 5\u00a0mm. Briefly, A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 cells transfected with SOX2\u2010OT siRNA (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells/well for quadruplicate) were seeded in 96\u2010well plates in RPMI\u20101640 containing 10% FBS to attach overnight, then cells were treated with drugs in different serial dilutions (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000\u00a0\u00b5m). Control cells for the erlotinib\u2010treated group were incubated in complete medium with DMSO, the final concentration of DMSO was 0.1\u20132.5% in medium. Control cells for the cisplatin\u2010treated group were incubated in complete medium. After 72\u00a0h of incubation in the case of erlotinib, and 48\u00a0h in the case of cisplatin, 20\u00a0\u00b5L of MTS CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Absorbance was determined by a multiwell spectrophotometer (Epoch, BioTek Instruments), at 490 and 690\u00a0nm for background. The inhibitory concentrations (IC50, IC25 and IC10) were calculated by graphpad prism software 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n      \n      \n        2.7\n        Clonogenic assays\n        Briefly, A549 cells seeded in 6\u2010well plates at 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/dish were transfected by siSCR or siMix (siOT1/siOT2); 24\u00a0h later, transfected cells were harvested and seeded in 12\u2010well plates by triplicate (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells/dish). Cells were left to adhere overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After 48\u00a0h, cells were exposed to TKI\u2010Erlotinib (IC25: 9.5\u00a0\u00b5m) or cisplatin (IC25: 0.75\u00a0\u00b5m) each 72\u00a0h for 21\u00a0days. Pharmacological drugs were removed, and cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and then incubated by drug medium. Cellular colonies were fixed by methanol and acetic acid (3\u00a0:\u00a01 v/v) for 5\u00a0min, solution was removed and plates were washed by running water. Cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5\u00a0min. Cellular colony growth was quantified using the imagej Colony Number plugin tools software.\n      \n      \n        2.8\n        Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP\u2010qPCR assays\n        Briefly, A549 cells were seeded in 6\u2010well plates at 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/dish, and transfected using siSCR and siMix (siOT1/siOT2) sequences; 48\u00a0h after transfection, they were cross\u2010linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min, and immediately neutralized with 0.125\u00a0m glycine for 5\u00a0min. The resulting cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and treated with lysis buffer (50\u00a0mm HEPES\u2010KOH pH 7.5, 140\u00a0mm NaCl, 1\u00a0mm EDTA pH 8, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (complete Mini; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The chromatin was sonicated for 20 pulses of 20\u00a0s w/u 60\u00a0watts. Then, 20\u00a0\u03bcg of fragmented chromatin was immunoprecipitated (ChIP) using a commercial EZ\u2010Magna ChIPTM G kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), and 2\u00a0\u03bcg of anti\u2010MEOX2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), as well as, 1\u00a0\u03bcg of activated anti\u2010H3K27Ac, anti\u2010H3K4me3, anti\u2010H3K27me3, anti\u2010H3K9me3 antibodies were added (Abcam). One microgram of anti\u2010mouse IgG was used as a negative control for ChIP (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). The IP\u2010DNAs were analyzed by performing absolute quantification by qPCR using a LightCycler 480 System Real\u2010TiME PCR instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and RealQ Plus 2\u00d7 Master Mix (AMPLIQON). A total of 20\u00a0ng of IP\u2010DNA was used per reaction, followed by the amplification of standard curves through serial dilutions of native DNA (diploid control genomic DNA) derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors (100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01\u00a0ng). The following amplification conditions were used: initial denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, annealing at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s and extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. All oligonucleotides set for the proposed gene promoter target sequences are listed in Table\u00a0S3 and were designed using the Primer3Plus program and synthetized by T4OLIGO Company (Irapuato, Mexico).\n      \n      \n        2.9\n        Immunofluorescence analysis\n        Samples were incubated with primary anti\u2010GLI\u20101 (Abcam; ab49314) and anti\u2010SOX2 (Santa Cruz; Sc\u2010365823) antibodies in PBS and 1% BSA overnight. Samples were washed twice by PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies: anti\u2010mouse CFL488 (Santa Cruz; Sc\u2010395759) and anti\u2010rabbit CFL647 (Santa Cruz; Sc\u20103739) in PBS and 1% BSA for 45\u00a0min followed by three washes with 0.1% PBS\u2010Tween, incubation with 2\u00a0ng\u00b7mL\u22121 DAPI, three washes with 0.1% PBS\u2010Tween, and two washes with PBS. Images were acquired in a fluorescence microscope, AXIO LAB1 from \u00aeZEISS (Jena, Germany). Representative pictures were taken at 100\u00d7 magnification. Imaging analysis was performed with imagej software 1.8.0.\n      \n      \n        2.10\n        Statistical analysis\n        \ngraphpad prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analyses. All data were represented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired t\u2010test (two\u2010tailed). For normally distributed data with unequal variance, an unpaired t\u2010test with Welch's correction was used. The spss (IBM SPSS Statistics version 15, Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for the statistical analysis of clinical variables in lung cancer patients. The chi\u2010square test was used to assess differences in the baseline characteristics of the population. Univariate analysis was used to analyze clinical and oncological variables of lung cancer patients associated with differential expression of target genes. Kaplan\u2013Meier overall survival analyses were performed according to the relative SOX2\u2010OT, SOX2, GLI1\u2010AS, and GLI\u20101 expression level, survival curves were examined using the log\u2010rank test.

These last samples were obtained from the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), Ismael Cos\u00edo Villegas. All experiments using human specimens were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and were approved by the Institutional Review Committees for INER (B17\u201007, B09\u201008, C61\u201016), and INCAN (008102510M1, CB451). All patients provided written informed consent for the surgical resection of the tissue sample and for its future use in genetic/epigenetic research studies.\n2.2\n        Oncological treatment\n        The EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (Toluca, Mexico). Erlotinib was dissolved in DMSO, the final concentration of DMSO was 2.5% in medium. Cisplatin was dissolved in medium culture. Human lung adenocarcinoma cells were seeded in 10\u00a0cm dishes to attach overnight. Briefly we obtained the IC25 of TKI\u2010erlotinib (TKI\u2010ER) and cisplatin (CisPlat) for each cell line. The next day, cells were treated with the IC25 of each drug according to cell line (A549: TKI\u2010ER: 10.10\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 2.76\u00a0\u00b5m, NCI\u2010H2347: TKI\u2010ER: 5.16\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 1.267\u00a0\u00b5m, NCI\u2010H1975: TKI\u2010ER: 14.785\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 1.735\u00a0\u00b5m and HCC827: TKI\u2010ER: 15\u00a0\u00b5m, CisPlat: 1.152\u00a0\u00b5m). Cells were harvested for futures assays after 12, 48, and 120\u00a0h of incubation.\n2.3\n        RNA isolation and RT\u2010qPCR assays\n        Total RNA was isolated from parental human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, cell cultures with different treatment conditions and human lung cancer tissue samples, using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration for RNA was evaluated by spectrophotometry using an UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Implen NanoPhotometer\u2122 NP80, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) . One microgram of total RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis with random hexamers using RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Mix\u2010Control was used for baseline expression for cancer cell lines in baseline conditions. The mix\u2010Control contained equimolar amounts of total RNA from cancer cell lines. The expression profiles of LncRNAs and mRNAs were determined by quantitative PCR using SYBR Green (RealQ Plus Master Mix; AMPLIQON, Odense M, Denmark), with U1 as internal control for LncRNAs and GAPDH as internal control for mRNAs. The PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table\u00a0S1. The conditions for qPCR were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of amplification: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. Melt curve: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, and 97\u00a0\u00b0C continuous. The qPCR was carried out using the LightCycler 480 System Real\u2010TiME PCR instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Differences in relative expression were calculated using the 2\u2010\u0394\u0394Ct or 2\u2010\u0394Ct method. All reactions were performed in experimental triplicates.\n2.4\n        Transient transfection (siRNA)\n        For transfection assays, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 A549 (wild\u2010type) and NCI\u2010H1975 (EGFR\u2010mutated) lung cancer cells were plated in 6\u2010well plates overnight and transfected with 50\u00a0ng of SOX2\u2010OT siRNA (siOT1 and siOT2) and equimolar amounts of siRNA siOT1/siOT2 (siMix) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The target sequence for SOX2\u2010OT siRNA has been previously reported [22]. Nontargeting SOX2\u2010OT RNA siRNA was used as a control (Control siRNA\u2010A/sc\u201037007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Sequences are provided in Table\u00a0S2. Cells were harvested 48\u00a0h after transfection for future assays.\n2.5\n        Western blot analysis\n        Cell cultures with different treatment conditions were lysed in RIPA buffer (HEPES\u2010KOH 1\u00a0m pH 7.5, NaCl 5\u00a0m, EDTA 0.5\u00a0m pH 8, Triton X\u2010100 20%, Sodium Deoxycholate 10%, SDS 20%) containing proteinase inhibitors (complete Mini, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio\u2010Rad DC\u2122 Protein Assay kit (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and absorbance was determined by a multiwell spectrophotometer (Epoch, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), at 750\u00a0nm. For western blot analysis, 30\u00a0\u00b5g of protein was separated by 10% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio\u2010Rad). Blocking was performed at room temperature for 2\u00a0h in TBS\u2010T with 5% milk (Blotting\u2010Grade Blocker; Bio\u2010Rad), followed by overnight incubation with different primary antibodies at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Primary antibodies against the following proteins and dilutions were used: GLI\u20101: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500 (Abcam, Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK), SOX2: 1\u00a0:\u00a02000 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), GAPDH: 1\u00a0:\u00a03000 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), p\u2010AKT: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500, t\u2010AKT: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), p\u2010ERK: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500, and t\u2010ERK: 1\u00a0:\u00a0500 (Cell Signaling Technology). After primary antibody incubation overnight, washing and incubation with secondary antibodies was performed: anti\u2010mouse or anti\u2010rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology), at 1\u00a0:\u00a010\u00a0000 dilution. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Clarity\u2122 Western ECL Substrate; Bio\u2010Rad). GAPDH was used as loading control. The intensities of protein levels were analyzed using imagej software (Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).\n2.6\n        Cellular viability (MTS assays)\n        EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO as stock solution at 10\u00a0mm. Cisplatin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was dissolved in NaCI 0.9% as stock solution at 5\u00a0mm. Briefly, A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 cells transfected with SOX2\u2010OT siRNA (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells/well for quadruplicate) were seeded in 96\u2010well plates in RPMI\u20101640 containing 10% FBS to attach overnight, then cells were treated with drugs in different serial dilutions (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000\u00a0\u00b5m). Control cells for the erlotinib\u2010treated group were incubated in complete medium with DMSO, the final concentration of DMSO was 0.1\u20132.5% in medium. Control cells for the cisplatin\u2010treated group were incubated in complete medium. After 72\u00a0h of incubation in the case of erlotinib, and 48\u00a0h in the case of cisplatin, 20\u00a0\u00b5L of MTS CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Absorbance was determined by a multiwell spectrophotometer (Epoch, BioTek Instruments), at 490 and 690\u00a0nm for background. The inhibitory concentrations (IC50, IC25 and IC10) were calculated by graphpad prism software 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n2.7\n        Clonogenic assays\n        Briefly, A549 cells seeded in 6\u2010well plates at 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/dish were transfected by siSCR or siMix (siOT1/siOT2); 24\u00a0h later, transfected cells were harvested and seeded in 12\u2010well plates by triplicate (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells/dish). Cells were left to adhere overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After 48\u00a0h, cells were exposed to TKI\u2010Erlotinib (IC25: 9.5\u00a0\u00b5m) or cisplatin (IC25: 0.75\u00a0\u00b5m) each 72\u00a0h for 21\u00a0days. Pharmacological drugs were removed, and cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and then incubated by drug medium. Cellular colonies were fixed by methanol and acetic acid (3\u00a0:\u00a01 v/v) for 5\u00a0min, solution was removed and plates were washed by running water. Cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5\u00a0min. Cellular colony growth was quantified using the imagej Colony Number plugin tools software.\n2.8\n        Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP\u2010qPCR assays\n        Briefly, A549 cells were seeded in 6\u2010well plates at 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/dish, and transfected using siSCR and siMix (siOT1/siOT2) sequences; 48\u00a0h after transfection, they were cross\u2010linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min, and immediately neutralized with 0.125\u00a0m glycine for 5\u00a0min. The resulting cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and treated with lysis buffer (50\u00a0mm HEPES\u2010KOH pH 7.5, 140\u00a0mm NaCl, 1\u00a0mm EDTA pH 8, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (complete Mini; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The chromatin was sonicated for 20 pulses of 20\u00a0s w/u 60\u00a0watts. Then, 20\u00a0\u03bcg of fragmented chromatin was immunoprecipitated (ChIP) using a commercial EZ\u2010Magna ChIPTM G kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), and 2\u00a0\u03bcg of anti\u2010MEOX2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), as well as, 1\u00a0\u03bcg of activated anti\u2010H3K27Ac, anti\u2010H3K4me3, anti\u2010H3K27me3, anti\u2010H3K9me3 antibodies were added (Abcam). One microgram of anti\u2010mouse IgG was used as a negative control for ChIP (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). The IP\u2010DNAs were analyzed by performing absolute quantification by qPCR using a LightCycler 480 System Real\u2010TiME PCR instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and RealQ Plus 2\u00d7 Master Mix (AMPLIQON). A total of 20\u00a0ng of IP\u2010DNA was used per reaction, followed by the amplification of standard curves through serial dilutions of native DNA (diploid control genomic DNA) derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors (100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01\u00a0ng). The following amplification conditions were used: initial denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, annealing at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s and extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. All oligonucleotides set for the proposed gene promoter target sequences are listed in Table\u00a0S3 and were designed using the Primer3Plus program and synthetized by T4OLIGO Company (Irapuato, Mexico).\n2.9\n        Immunofluorescence analysis\n        Samples were incubated with primary anti\u2010GLI\u20101 (Abcam; ab49314) and anti\u2010SOX2 (Santa Cruz; Sc\u2010365823) antibodies in PBS and 1% BSA overnight. Samples were washed twice by PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies: anti\u2010mouse CFL488 (Santa Cruz; Sc\u2010395759) and anti\u2010rabbit CFL647 (Santa Cruz; Sc\u20103739) in PBS and 1% BSA for 45\u00a0min followed by three washes with 0.1% PBS\u2010Tween, incubation with 2\u00a0ng\u00b7mL\u22121 DAPI, three washes with 0.1% PBS\u2010Tween, and two washes with PBS. Images were acquired in a fluorescence microscope, AXIO LAB1 from \u00aeZEISS (Jena, Germany). Representative pictures were taken at 100\u00d7 magnification. Imaging analysis was performed with imagej software 1.8.0.\n2.10\n        Statistical analysis\n        \ngraphpad prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analyses. All data were represented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired t\u2010test (two\u2010tailed). For normally distributed data with unequal variance, an unpaired t\u2010test with Welch's correction was used. The spss (IBM SPSS Statistics version 15, Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for the statistical analysis of clinical variables in lung cancer patients. The chi\u2010square test was used to assess differences in the baseline characteristics of the population. Univariate analysis was used to analyze clinical and oncological variables of lung cancer patients associated with differential expression of target genes. Kaplan\u2013Meier overall survival analyses were performed according to the relative SOX2\u2010OT, SOX2, GLI1\u2010AS, and GLI\u20101 expression level, survival curves were examined using the log\u2010rank test. Significance was defined as *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, and ****P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001.\n3\n      Results\n      \n        3.1\n        Co\u2010expressed LncRNA\u2010SOX2\u2010OT/mRNA\u2010SOX2 binomial by lung cancer cells in\u00a0vitro\n\n        Differential expression patterns and levels of the LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT, in contrast to other LncRNAs (GLI1\u2010AS, GAS5, ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1), were identified in several lung cancer cell lines at baseline cellular culture conditions. The highest expression levels for ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1 were identified on A549, NCI\u2010H2347, NCI\u2010H1975 and HCC827 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a01A). In contrast, both EGFR\u2010mutated lung cancer cells NCI\u2010H1975 and HCC827 had higher expression levels for LncRNA GAS5. However, it was possible to detect overexpressed GLI1\u2010AS in both EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type lung cancer cells A549 and NCI\u2010H2347. Overexpression of SOX2\u2010OT levels were mainly detected in A549 (EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type) and NCI\u2010H1975 (EGFR\u2010mutated) cells (Fig.\u00a01A). Additionally, in baseline cell culture conditions, we observed a probable negative correlation in co\u2010expression of the LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT with mRNA SOX2; a similar pattern was identified for the LncRNA ZEB1\u2010AS with its mRNA ZEB1 (Fig.\u00a01A,B). Whereas a positive correlation in the co\u2010expressed LncRNA GLI1\u2010AS with mRNA GLI\u20101, were detected (Fig.\u00a01A,B). Based on this data, the possible co\u2010induced phenomenon of the LncRNAs, with its respective neighborhood mRNA, by oncological\u2010drug treatments was analyzed.\n        \n          Fig. 1\n          \n            Analyses of the genetic expression pattern of LncRNAs, and LncRNA\u2010mRNA binomial axes, at baseline cell culture conditions in human lung cancer cell lines.

Error bars represent the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of three independent experiments. Mix\u2010Control is a pool of equal amounts of each total RNA in lung cancer cell lines.\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Co\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2 binomial is positively induced by cisplatin or EGFR\u2010TKI treatment in lung cancer cells\n        Lung cancer cell lines A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 were stimulated by in\u00a0vitro incubation with either cisplatin (IC25: 2.76\u00a0\u00b5m and IC25: 1.735\u00a0\u00b5m, respectively) or TKI\u2010erlotinib (IC25: 10.10\u00a0\u00b5m and IC25: 14.785\u00a0\u00b5m, respectively) for 12, 48 and 120\u00a0h. Results showed a significant inducible expression pattern of the LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT for lung cancer cells A549 (Fig.\u00a02A), and NCI\u2010H1975 (Fig.\u00a02B), as well as significant changes for both LncRNAs ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1, while a nonsignificant inducible expression pattern for both LncRNAs GLI1\u2010AS and GAS5 was detected in A549 (Fig.\u00a02A), and NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02B). Further, we observed an increase in the induced co\u2010expression pattern of the SOX2\u2010OT with SOX2 (Fig.\u00a02A) after treatment with cisplatin or TKI\u2010erlotinib at 48 and 120\u00a0h in lung cancer cells A549 (Fig.\u00a02C). An increase in the co\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT (Fig.\u00a02B) and SOX2 at 12 and 48\u00a0h was also detected in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02D). All of this contrasted with the significant induced expression of LncRNAs GLI1\u2010AS/ZEB1\u2010AS (Fig.\u00a02B), with their nonsignificant induced expression of their corresponding coding genes GLI\u20101 and ZEB1, in both A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 cells (Fig.\u00a02C,D).\n        \n          Fig. 2\n          \n            Analyses of the induced relative gene expression, in the presence of the cisplatin or EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010Erlotinib treatment in EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type and EGFR\u2010mutated lung cancer cells.

(C) mRNA expression profile in A549 cells, and (D) NCI\u2010H1975 cells. Relative expression levels have been analyzed by RT\u2010qPCR assays. Error bars represent the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of three independent experiments. CisPlat: cisplatin, TKI\u2010ER: TKI\u2010erlotinib. Unpaired t\u2010test (Two\u2010tailed) used to compare to the control and combination groups. *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, ****P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001.\n          \n          \n        \n        Regarding this last point, we had proposed to identify possible epigenetic histone code changes at 5\u2032 upstream of the SOX2\u2010OT gene promoter sequences induced by oncological drug treatment on lung cancer cells. We identified nonsignificant enrichment changes in the activation histone code H3K4me3/H3K27Ac, and a slight decrease in repressive histone H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a0S1). This would imply that there is an unknown molecular mechanism involved in the inducible pattern exhibited by exposure to oncological treatment (cisplatin/TKI\u2010erlotinib) for LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT.\n        Nevertheless, we identified that, at baseline conditions, SOX2\u2010OT variant 1 positively correlates, while SOX2\u2010OT variant 6 negatively correlates, with mRNA SOX2/GLI\u20101 expression, in A549 cells, compared with a heterogeneous expression level in different lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S2A,B). In addition, our analysis identified that relative abundance of SOX2, and GLI\u20101 proteins is homogeneously high in A549, NCI\u2010H2347, and NCI\u2010H1975, but not in HCC827 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S2C). In addition, we have identified high and homogeneous protein levels for total\u2010AKT and total\u2010ERK at baseline conditions (Fig.\u00a0S2C). We also observed that such total\u2010AKT and \u2010ERK protein levels (Fig.\u00a0S2D), as well as phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated ERK proteins levels (Fig.\u00a0S2E), remain homogeneously elevated in the presence of cisplatin or TKI\u2010erlotinib, at 12, 48 and 120\u00a0h, in A549 cells. In consequence to the observation that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is overexpressed following drug exposure, we explored whether total or phosphorylated AKT and \u2010ERK protein levels are positive or negatively regulated by SOX2\u2010OT, in lung cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        SOX2\u2010OT positively promotes total\u2010AKT/ERK and phosphorylated\u2010AKT protein levels, as well as resistance to oncological therapy\n        Next, using genetic silencing (siRNAs) assays we show that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT controls the relative abundance of the total and phosphorylated\u2010AKT and \u2010ERK proteins, promoting resistance mechanisms to oncological\u2010drug treatments. First, both siRNAs, SOX2\u2010OT variant 1 (siOT1) and 6 (siOT2), reduced SOX2\u2010OT expression in A549 (Fig.\u00a03A), and NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S3A). Second, both siOT1 and siOT2 (siRNA\u2010Mix) significantly reduced total\u2010AKT and total\u2010ERK protein levels, as well as decreased phosphorylated\u2010AKT protein level (Fig.\u00a03B). In contrast, silenced SOX2\u2010OT promotes increased ERK\u2010phosphorylated levels (Fig.\u00a03B). Suggesting that activation of the PI3K\u2010AKT pathway occurs in a SOX2\u2010OT\u2010dependent manner, while the activated KRAS\u2010ERK pathway is only partially dependent on SOX2\u2010OT. Nevertheless, in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells we did not identify any significant changes in the total AKT\u2010ERK protein levels, but observed an increase in phosphorylated pAKT/pERK protein levels (Fig.\u00a0S3B). Based on this information, it was possible to determine that SOX2\u2010OT increases resistance to EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib or cisplatin treatment in A549 cells (Fig.\u00a03C), as well as resistance to therapy in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S3C). To provide additional evidence for the involvement of the LncRNA in regard to therapy resistance, we carried out clonogenic (cellular proliferation) assays through genetic silencing by siMix\u2010SOX2\u2010OT on A549 cells. Transfected lung cancer cells were exposed to TKI\u2010erlotinib or cisplatin using an IC25 pharmacological concentration every 72\u00a0h for 21\u00a0days. Genetically silenced or reduced SOX2\u2010OT levels decreased cellular proliferation and promoted sensitivity to both drugs (TKI\u2010erlotinib/cisplatin) (Fig.\u00a03D). It is likely that SOX2\u2010OT is involved in transcriptional epigenetic regulation of the SOX\u2010GLI\u20101 gene axis, and also self\u2010regulation.\n        \n          Fig. 3\n          \n            Silenced LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT promotes reduction in the relative abundance levels of total\u2010AKT/ERK proteins, as well as, phosphorylated\u2010AKT/ERK protein levels, and promotes sensitivity to EGFR\u2010TKI and cisplatin treatment in lung cancer cells. (A) Genetic silencing assays for LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT variants 1 and 6, and RT\u2010qPCR assay analysis, identified a reduction in SOX\u2010OT relative expression level.

This specific\u2010genetic scenario was also identified both in mRNA and protein levels in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S3B,D). On the other hand, also using genetic silencing siMix\u2010SOX2\u2010OT assays, we identified that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is able to promote a positive epigenetic biofeedback, by the enrichment of activated histone H3K4me3 levels, with no changes of H3K27Ac at the SOX2\u2010OT gene promoter sequences (Fig.\u00a04C). Interestingly, LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT significantly reduced repressive histone enrichment, H3K9me3/H3K27me3, at the SOX2\u2010OT promoter sequences (Fig.\u00a04D). Additionally, we detected that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT negatively controls to the enrichment of activated histones H3K4me3/H3K27Ac (Fig.\u00a0S4A), but slightly controls the repressive histones H3K9me3/H3K27me3 levels at GLI\u20101 gene promotor sequences (Fig.\u00a0S4B). Nevertheless, such epigenetic changes do not explain the reduction in the GLI\u20101 mRNA/protein expression. The overexpressed SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 trinomial axis could represent a new molecular signature involved in lung cancer biology and therapy response.\n        \n          Fig. 4\n          \n            Silenced LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT promotes a decrease in mRNA transcript expression and SOX2 and GLI\u20101 protein level, as well as promotes changes in the histone enrichment of the H3K4me3/H3K9me3/H3K27me3 chromatin profiles at SOX2\u2010OT gene promoter sequences in lung cancer cells.

In contrast, down\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT in human lung carcinomas (Fig.\u00a0S5A), is associated to better overall survival, ranging from 11 to 94\u00a0months, with favorable response to oncological therapy (Table\u00a01).

A significant (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) increase in GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 binomial expression level was also identified in risk\u2010factor exposed lung cancer patients (Fig.\u00a05B) compared with normal lung tissue. It is important to highlight that both SOX2 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), and GLI\u20101 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) genes remain significantly overexpressed in both non\u2010 and risk\u2010exposed lung cancer patient subgroups (Fig.\u00a05A,B).\n        \n          Fig. 5\n          \n            Overexpressed LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is associated with a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients independent of risk\u2010factor exposure, where co\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 is associated with a lung malignant phenotype.

(C, D) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis for lung carcinoma patients (INCan cohort) with low or high SOX2\u2010OT and SOX2 expression.

(F) Correlative co\u2010expression indexes for SOX2 and GLI\u20101 genes, were determined by higher co\u2010expression rates in histological samples, associated with a histological malignant phenotype of the human lung carcinoma tissues. A highest co\u2010expression rate GLI\u20101/SOX2 was reached in 33% for the normal lung adjacent tumor tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a025), compared with lung carcinoma tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a040) which had a 76% (higher co\u2010expression).

This contrasts with SOX\u2010OT expression levels, in which case we did not identify any significant differences in terms of higher or lower expression (20.92 versus 19.97\u00a0months median overall survival) (Fig.\u00a05C,D), similar data was obtained pertaining to GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 expression (Fig.\u00a0S5B,C).\n        Furthermore, univariate analyses on clinical outcome of the lung cancer patients let us to identify that oncological metastasis is significatively (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.009) associated with overexpressed LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT levels (Table\u00a0S4), as well as, overexpressed SOX2 levels significatively (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.021) associated with smoking exposition (Table\u00a0S5). On the other hand, overexpressed GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 levels, associated with wood smoke exposure (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.08) and advanced clinical stages IIIB\u2010IV (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.038) (see Tables\u00a0S6 and S7).\n        Finally, in\u00a0situ immunofluorescence analyses identified lower co\u2010expressed SOX2/GLI\u20101 proteins in nonmalignant lung tissue samples (Fig.\u00a05E) with a low co\u2010expression (24%), medium co\u2010expression (43%) and higher co\u2010expression (33%) pattern (Fig.\u00a05F). In contrast, human lung carcinomas showed a low co\u2010expression (2%), medium co\u2010expression (22%), and higher co\u2010expression (76%) SOX2/GLI\u20101 protein pattern. This is compatible with a poorer histological differentiation phenotype in advanced clinical stages IIIB\u2010IV (Fig.\u00a05F). Altogether, the evidence highlights the conclusive role of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 trinomial co\u2010expressed axis in poorer oncological treatment response, and poorer overall survival in lung cancer.\n3.1\n        Co\u2010expressed LncRNA\u2010SOX2\u2010OT/mRNA\u2010SOX2 binomial by lung cancer cells in\u00a0vitro\n\n        Differential expression patterns and levels of the LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT, in contrast to other LncRNAs (GLI1\u2010AS, GAS5, ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1), were identified in several lung cancer cell lines at baseline cellular culture conditions. The highest expression levels for ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1 were identified on A549, NCI\u2010H2347, NCI\u2010H1975 and HCC827 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a01A). In contrast, both EGFR\u2010mutated lung cancer cells NCI\u2010H1975 and HCC827 had higher expression levels for LncRNA GAS5. However, it was possible to detect overexpressed GLI1\u2010AS in both EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type lung cancer cells A549 and NCI\u2010H2347. Overexpression of SOX2\u2010OT levels were mainly detected in A549 (EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type) and NCI\u2010H1975 (EGFR\u2010mutated) cells (Fig.\u00a01A). Additionally, in baseline cell culture conditions, we observed a probable negative correlation in co\u2010expression of the LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT with mRNA SOX2; a similar pattern was identified for the LncRNA ZEB1\u2010AS with its mRNA ZEB1 (Fig.\u00a01A,B). Whereas a positive correlation in the co\u2010expressed LncRNA GLI1\u2010AS with mRNA GLI\u20101, were detected (Fig.\u00a01A,B). Based on this data, the possible co\u2010induced phenomenon of the LncRNAs, with its respective neighborhood mRNA, by oncological\u2010drug treatments was analyzed.\n        \n          Fig. 1\n          \n            Analyses of the genetic expression pattern of LncRNAs, and LncRNA\u2010mRNA binomial axes, at baseline cell culture conditions in human lung cancer cell lines.

Results showed a significant inducible expression pattern of the LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT for lung cancer cells A549 (Fig.\u00a02A), and NCI\u2010H1975 (Fig.\u00a02B), as well as significant changes for both LncRNAs ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1, while a nonsignificant inducible expression pattern for both LncRNAs GLI1\u2010AS and GAS5 was detected in A549 (Fig.\u00a02A), and NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02B). Further, we observed an increase in the induced co\u2010expression pattern of the SOX2\u2010OT with SOX2 (Fig.\u00a02A) after treatment with cisplatin or TKI\u2010erlotinib at 48 and 120\u00a0h in lung cancer cells A549 (Fig.\u00a02C). An increase in the co\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT (Fig.\u00a02B) and SOX2 at 12 and 48\u00a0h was also detected in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02D). All of this contrasted with the significant induced expression of LncRNAs GLI1\u2010AS/ZEB1\u2010AS (Fig.\u00a02B), with their nonsignificant induced expression of their corresponding coding genes GLI\u20101 and ZEB1, in both A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 cells (Fig.\u00a02C,D).\n        \n          Fig. 2\n          \n            Analyses of the induced relative gene expression, in the presence of the cisplatin or EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010Erlotinib treatment in EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type and EGFR\u2010mutated lung cancer cells.

We identified nonsignificant enrichment changes in the activation histone code H3K4me3/H3K27Ac, and a slight decrease in repressive histone H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a0S1). This would imply that there is an unknown molecular mechanism involved in the inducible pattern exhibited by exposure to oncological treatment (cisplatin/TKI\u2010erlotinib) for LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT.\n        Nevertheless, we identified that, at baseline conditions, SOX2\u2010OT variant 1 positively correlates, while SOX2\u2010OT variant 6 negatively correlates, with mRNA SOX2/GLI\u20101 expression, in A549 cells, compared with a heterogeneous expression level in different lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S2A,B). In addition, our analysis identified that relative abundance of SOX2, and GLI\u20101 proteins is homogeneously high in A549, NCI\u2010H2347, and NCI\u2010H1975, but not in HCC827 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S2C). In addition, we have identified high and homogeneous protein levels for total\u2010AKT and total\u2010ERK at baseline conditions (Fig.\u00a0S2C). We also observed that such total\u2010AKT and \u2010ERK protein levels (Fig.\u00a0S2D), as well as phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated ERK proteins levels (Fig.\u00a0S2E), remain homogeneously elevated in the presence of cisplatin or TKI\u2010erlotinib, at 12, 48 and 120\u00a0h, in A549 cells. In consequence to the observation that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is overexpressed following drug exposure, we explored whether total or phosphorylated AKT and \u2010ERK protein levels are positive or negatively regulated by SOX2\u2010OT, in lung cancer cells.\n3.3\n        SOX2\u2010OT positively promotes total\u2010AKT/ERK and phosphorylated\u2010AKT protein levels, as well as resistance to oncological therapy\n        Next, using genetic silencing (siRNAs) assays we show that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT controls the relative abundance of the total and phosphorylated\u2010AKT and \u2010ERK proteins, promoting resistance mechanisms to oncological\u2010drug treatments. First, both siRNAs, SOX2\u2010OT variant 1 (siOT1) and 6 (siOT2), reduced SOX2\u2010OT expression in A549 (Fig.\u00a03A), and NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S3A). Second, both siOT1 and siOT2 (siRNA\u2010Mix) significantly reduced total\u2010AKT and total\u2010ERK protein levels, as well as decreased phosphorylated\u2010AKT protein level (Fig.\u00a03B). In contrast, silenced SOX2\u2010OT promotes increased ERK\u2010phosphorylated levels (Fig.\u00a03B). Suggesting that activation of the PI3K\u2010AKT pathway occurs in a SOX2\u2010OT\u2010dependent manner, while the activated KRAS\u2010ERK pathway is only partially dependent on SOX2\u2010OT. Nevertheless, in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells we did not identify any significant changes in the total AKT\u2010ERK protein levels, but observed an increase in phosphorylated pAKT/pERK protein levels (Fig.\u00a0S3B). Based on this information, it was possible to determine that SOX2\u2010OT increases resistance to EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib or cisplatin treatment in A549 cells (Fig.\u00a03C), as well as resistance to therapy in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S3C). To provide additional evidence for the involvement of the LncRNA in regard to therapy resistance, we carried out clonogenic (cellular proliferation) assays through genetic silencing by siMix\u2010SOX2\u2010OT on A549 cells. Transfected lung cancer cells were exposed to TKI\u2010erlotinib or cisplatin using an IC25 pharmacological concentration every 72\u00a0h for 21\u00a0days. Genetically silenced or reduced SOX2\u2010OT levels decreased cellular proliferation and promoted sensitivity to both drugs (TKI\u2010erlotinib/cisplatin) (Fig.\u00a03D). It is likely that SOX2\u2010OT is involved in transcriptional epigenetic regulation of the SOX\u2010GLI\u20101 gene axis, and also self\u2010regulation.\n        \n          Fig. 3\n          \n            Silenced LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT promotes reduction in the relative abundance levels of total\u2010AKT/ERK proteins, as well as, phosphorylated\u2010AKT/ERK protein levels, and promotes sensitivity to EGFR\u2010TKI and cisplatin treatment in lung cancer cells. (A) Genetic silencing assays for LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT variants 1 and 6, and RT\u2010qPCR assay analysis, identified a reduction in SOX\u2010OT relative expression level. (B) Total AKT, ERK and phosphorylated\u2010AKT, ERK levels were obtained by western blot analysis and relative densitometric analysis. (C) Cellular cytotoxicity assays identified inhibitory concentrations (IC) for the TKI\u2010erlotinib response as follows: siSCR group: IC50\u00a0=\u00a082.45\u00a0\u00b5m, siOT1 group: IC50\u00a0=\u00a045.57\u00a0\u00b5m, siOT2 group: IC50\u00a0=\u00a060.26\u00a0\u00b5m, and siMix group: IC50\u00a0=\u00a070.76\u00a0\u00b5m. siSCR group: IC25\u00a0=\u00a021.54\u00a0\u00b5m, siOT1 group: IC25\u00a0=\u00a03.039\u00a0\u00b5m, siOT2 group: IC25\u00a0=\u00a011.25\u00a0\u00b5m, and siMix group: IC25\u00a0=\u00a05.778\u00a0\u00b5m. siSCR group: IC10\u00a0=\u00a05.523\u00a0\u00b5m, siOT1 group: IC10\u00a0=\u00a00.2027\u00a0\u00b5m, siOT2 group: IC10\u00a0=\u00a02.102\u00a0\u00b5m, and siMix group: IC10\u00a0=\u00a00.4719\u00a0\u00b5m.

(D) Images from the clonogenic assay for transfected A549 siMix\u2010SOX2\u2010OT.

IC25 were previously obtained for MTT assays in A549 lung cancer parental cells (data not shown). Error bars represent the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of three independent experimental assays. Unpaired t\u2010test (Two\u2010tailed) was used to compare control (siSCR) group, and experimental combination groups. *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, ****P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001.\n3.4\n        Silenced LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT reduces co\u2010expressed SOX2 and GLI\u20101 genes, affecting histone code H3K4me3/H3K9me3/H3K27me3 at gene promoter sequences\n        Next, we identified that siMix\u2010SOX2\u2010OT positively controls both genetic expression of SOX2\u2010GLI\u20101 mRNAs (Fig.\u00a04A) and relative abundance of SOX2 and GLI\u20101 protein levels, in A549 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04B). This specific\u2010genetic scenario was also identified both in mRNA and protein levels in NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig.\u00a0S3B,D). On the other hand, also using genetic silencing siMix\u2010SOX2\u2010OT assays, we identified that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is able to promote a positive epigenetic biofeedback, by the enrichment of activated histone H3K4me3 levels, with no changes of H3K27Ac at the SOX2\u2010OT gene promoter sequences (Fig.\u00a04C). Interestingly, LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT significantly reduced repressive histone enrichment, H3K9me3/H3K27me3, at the SOX2\u2010OT promoter sequences (Fig.\u00a04D). Additionally, we detected that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT negatively controls to the enrichment of activated histones H3K4me3/H3K27Ac (Fig.\u00a0S4A), but slightly controls the repressive histones H3K9me3/H3K27me3 levels at GLI\u20101 gene promotor sequences (Fig.\u00a0S4B). Nevertheless, such epigenetic changes do not explain the reduction in the GLI\u20101 mRNA/protein expression. The overexpressed SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 trinomial axis could represent a new molecular signature involved in lung cancer biology and therapy response.\n        \n          Fig. 4\n          \n            Silenced LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT promotes a decrease in mRNA transcript expression and SOX2 and GLI\u20101 protein level, as well as promotes changes in the histone enrichment of the H3K4me3/H3K9me3/H3K27me3 chromatin profiles at SOX2\u2010OT gene promoter sequences in lung cancer cells.

In contrast, down\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT in human lung carcinomas (Fig.\u00a0S5A), is associated to better overall survival, ranging from 11 to 94\u00a0months, with favorable response to oncological therapy (Table\u00a01). Interestingly, when evaluating normal adjacent lung tissue, we also identified down\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT levels (Fig.\u00a0S5A).\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Clinical outcomes for lung cancer patients.

A significant (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) increase in GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 binomial expression level was also identified in risk\u2010factor exposed lung cancer patients (Fig.\u00a05B) compared with normal lung tissue. It is important to highlight that both SOX2 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), and GLI\u20101 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) genes remain significantly overexpressed in both non\u2010 and risk\u2010exposed lung cancer patient subgroups (Fig.\u00a05A,B).\n        \n          Fig. 5\n          \n            Overexpressed LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is associated with a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients independent of risk\u2010factor exposure, where co\u2010expressed SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 is associated with a lung malignant phenotype. (A) Relative expression of the co\u2010expressed pattern LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT and mRNA SOX2. (B) Relative expression of the co\u2010expressed LncRNA GLI1\u2010AS and mRNA GLI\u20101, in human lung cancer patients (INCAN Cohort), without risk factors (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and with exposure to risk factors (Tobacco Smoking and/or Wood Smoke\u2010Risk; n\u00a0=\u00a023), compared with nonmalignant lung tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a03). (C, D) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis for lung carcinoma patients (INCan cohort) with low or high SOX2\u2010OT and SOX2 expression.

(E) Representative image of co\u2010expression of SOX2 (green staining) and GLI\u20101 (red staining) proteins in human normal lung adjacent tissues and lung tumor tissues (INER Cohort), nuclei were detected by DAPI dye.

(F) Correlative co\u2010expression indexes for SOX2 and GLI\u20101 genes, were determined by higher co\u2010expression rates in histological samples, associated with a histological malignant phenotype of the human lung carcinoma tissues. A highest co\u2010expression rate GLI\u20101/SOX2 was reached in 33% for the normal lung adjacent tumor tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a025), compared with lung carcinoma tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a040) which had a 76% (higher co\u2010expression).

Unpaired t\u2010test and Welch's correction, *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01.\n          \n          \n        \n        In addition, we evaluated overall survival in patients included in this study and identified that patients with a higher expression of SOX2 reach a median overall survival of 19.97\u00a0months (95% CI: 0.00\u201341.76), while patients with lower SOX2 expression level reached a median overall survival of 37.25\u00a0months (95% CI: 3.52\u201370.99). This contrasts with SOX\u2010OT expression levels, in which case we did not identify any significant differences in terms of higher or lower expression (20.92 versus 19.97\u00a0months median overall survival) (Fig.\u00a05C,D), similar data was obtained pertaining to GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 expression (Fig.\u00a0S5B,C).\n        Furthermore, univariate analyses on clinical outcome of the lung cancer patients let us to identify that oncological metastasis is significatively (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.009) associated with overexpressed LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT levels (Table\u00a0S4), as well as, overexpressed SOX2 levels significatively (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.021) associated with smoking exposition (Table\u00a0S5). On the other hand, overexpressed GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 levels, associated with wood smoke exposure (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.08) and advanced clinical stages IIIB\u2010IV (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.038) (see Tables\u00a0S6 and S7).\n        Finally, in\u00a0situ immunofluorescence analyses identified lower co\u2010expressed SOX2/GLI\u20101 proteins in nonmalignant lung tissue samples (Fig.\u00a05E) with a low co\u2010expression (24%), medium co\u2010expression (43%) and higher co\u2010expression (33%) pattern (Fig.\u00a05F). In contrast, human lung carcinomas showed a low co\u2010expression (2%), medium co\u2010expression (22%), and higher co\u2010expression (76%) SOX2/GLI\u20101 protein pattern. This is compatible with a poorer histological differentiation phenotype in advanced clinical stages IIIB\u2010IV (Fig.\u00a05F). Altogether, the evidence highlights the conclusive role of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 trinomial co\u2010expressed axis in poorer oncological treatment response, and poorer overall survival in lung cancer.\n4\n      Discussion\n      Expression profiles of LncRNAs in different cancer types have been widely reported [29]. In the present work, we identified a significant baseline or inducible expression pattern of several LncRNAs in lung cancer cells, including SOX2\u2010OT, GLI1\u2010AS, GAS5, ZEB1\u2010AS and UCA1, some of which play a key biological role in embryo development and malignant disease progression, including lung cancer [30, 31, 32]. Based on its neighborhood genomic location, binomial\u2010transcripts (LncRNAs/mRNAs) were identified in a co\u2010expressed pattern, highlighting that SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2, and GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101 in human lung cancer cells and solid lung carcinomas probably engage in a dynamic positive/negative correlation, as has been previously reported for prostate and breast carcinomas [33, 34]. Similar findings have been reported in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas for other binomial LncRNA/mRNA transcripts, such as: NR_003919/PIK3R1, NR_027340/ITGB1, MIR31HG/HIF1A, and SOX2\u2010OT/DDIT4 [35]. In addition, we detected significant changes in the baseline expression levels for binomial transcript SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2. A positive correlation had been previously reported in different kind of cancers, including breast, bladder, osteosarcoma, and relevant to this study, lung carcinomas [11, 15, 16, 22].\n      We have demonstrated using in\u00a0vitro cisplatin or TKI\u2010erlotinib treatment, routinely used in human lung cancer therapy schemes [36, 37], a significant induced overexpressed LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT level, in contrast with other LncRNAs, such as GLI1\u2010AS, GAS5, ZEB1\u2010AS, and UCA1. Also, overexpressed pluripotency transcription factor SOX2 and Sonic Hedgehog (Sh) pathway GLI\u20101 effector genes were detected in a pharmacologically induced dependent manner in both A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 lung cancer cells. It has been previously reported that overexpressed GLI\u20101 is associated with cisplatin resistance [28], the co\u2010expressed GLI\u20101/SOX2 transcript axis is related to TKI\u2010erlotinib [27], and taxane\u2010gemcitabine\u2010drug cancer resistance in prostate and lung cancer [38]. Nonetheless, our data shows that a co\u2010expressed pattern of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 \u2018trinomial axis\u2019 is likely involved in therapy failure and poorer clinical prognosis, through epigenetic mechanisms which interact in lung cancer drug resistance.\n      However, our results suggest that cancer drug\u2010induced LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT was not the sole result of the activated histone profile H3K4me3/H3K27Ac/RNA Pol II, as these changes were not statistically significant. Nor by a reduction in the repressive histone H3K27me3 on SOX2\u2010OT gene promoter sequences. Pertaining to this last observation, few reports have detected pharmacological effects\u2014cisplatin or TKIs\u2014on aberrant epigenetic mechanisms, as it has been reported for H3K27me3, or chromatin remodeling protein complexes \u2018chromatin\u2010writers\u2019 levels, in human cancer cells [39]. However, scarce experimental evidence allows us to explain the expression of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2 axis in cancer, which has been recently reported to be genetic/epigenetically regulated through MTA3 and GATA3, probably in a NurD (chromatin remodeling complex) interaction, affecting cancer stemness and metastasis. This would propose the MTA3/SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2 axis as a potential cancer stratification molecular\u2010marker, and therapeutic targets in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas [40]. Additionally, another LncRNA/mRNA binomial axis (GLI1\u2010AS/GLI\u20101) has been reported to be epigenetically regulated (enriched histone H3K27me3) at bidirectional gene promoter sequences, involved in tumor cellular proliferation and in\u00a0vivo xenograft tumor growth [34].\n      Interestingly, resistance mechanisms to oncological drugs based on drug\u2010efflux, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and cancer cell stemness, as well as, mutations in TK receptors (e.g. EGFR) have partially been explained for both chemotherapy and targeted therapy in lung cancer [41, 42]. Likewise, resistance mechanisms to cisplatin and TKI\u2010erlotinib have been associated to increased phosphorylation of the EGFR\u2010downstream cell signaling molecules, as it occurs for phosphorylated\u2010AKT and phosphorylated\u2010ERK intermediary proteins [43, 44]. Based on this, a KRAS gene mutation in A549 EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type lung cancer cells actively promotes over\u2010phosphorylated EGFR\u2010AKT levels, keeping its over\u2010activated level even when using EGFR\u2010TKIs treatment [45]. Our results propose that LncRNA/SOX2\u2010OT can disrupt lung cancer therapy resistance capacity, by downregulation of the EGFR\u2010AKT\u2010ERK expression and activation rate.\n      In human lung oncology, poor clinical prognosis (overall survival) has largely been dependent of tumor therapy resistance mechanism capacities [46]. In this regard, the role of LncRNAs as molecular resistance mechanisms to cisplatin/EGFR\u2010TKIs\u2010based therapies has recently been reviewed, with discussions focusing on their therapeutic potential in lung cancer [47]. Some LncRNAs including HOTAIR, MALAT1, NEAT1, and NNT\u2010AS1 have been involved in cisplatin resistance, through WNT and/or MAPK/Slug intracellular signaling pathways, as well as promoting malignancy in solid lung tumors, and lung cancer cell lines [48, 49, 50, 51]. Meanwhile some LncRNAs, as UCA1 and BC087858, promote activation of the EGFR cell signaling pathway members, such as AKT/mTOR, and/or ERK in NSCLC [52, 53]. In this present work, we have highlighted an induced overexpressed SOX2\u2010OT level, where siRNAs knockdown of SOX2\u2010OT reduces total\u2010 and phosphorylated\u2010AKT protein levels in EGFR\u2010wild\u2010type, KRAS\u2010mutated A549 lung cancer cells. However, we detected little variation in the phosphorylated\u2010AKT and phosphorylated\u2010ERK levels by siRNAs anti\u2010SOX2\u2010OT in NCI\u2010H1975 cells. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that LncRNAs are functional participants in therapy resistance/sensitivity to cancer drugs, and target\u2010gene therapies \u2018EGFR/AKT/ERK/mTOR\u2019 [47]. It has been previously reported that SOX2\u2010OT participates in the activation of the AKT\u2010member of cellular signaling pathways in cholangiocarcinoma [14], as well as being involved in the magnitude of resistance mechanism to EGFR\u2010TKIs\u2010based treatment related to the functionality of phosphatase PTEN, reducing AKT phosphorylation in NSCLC [54]. In this sense, PTEN has been previously considered as a tumor suppressor gene, associated with cisplatin resistance mechanisms in gastric cancer [55]. Meanwhile, LncRNAs such as GAS5, TP53TG1, and AC078883.3 have been associated with cisplatin sensitivity through miR\u201021/PTEN, miR\u201018a/PTEN, and PTEN/AKT axis, respectively, in human lung carcinomas [56, 57, 58]. It has been proposed that overexpression of LncRNA GAS5 might reverse resistance to gefitinib in A549 lung cells, promoting a reduction in p\u2010AKT, p\u2010ERK, p\u2010EGFR, and p\u2010IGF1R levels through an unknown mechanism [59]. In contrast, our results show that genetic silencing of LncRNA SOX2/OT reduced t\u2010AKT, t\u2010ERK, and p\u2010AKT levels in lung cancer cells.\n      Based on the beforementioned information, it has been described that the expression of the PTEN phosphatase is epigenetically controlled, through promoter methylation in human lung carcinomas [60]. Tai et al. [61] have demonstrated that expression of the PTEN gene is epigenetically controlled by SOX2\u2010OT, through the recruitment of the enzyme histone methyltransferase EZH2, increasing repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the PTEN promoter level in epithelial tumors, probably supporting that PTEN targeted\u2010AKT, epigenetically regulated by SOX2\u2010OT, is involved in target therapy resistance in epithelial lung tumors.\n      In addition, due to the intronic location of SOX2\u2010OT at the SOX2 genetic locus, some studies have described a co\u2010expression pattern for SOX2\u2010OT and SOX2 in embryo development and cancer [13, 62, 63]. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of SOX2 gene regulation by LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT has not been achieved. In this study, we demonstrate that SOX2\u2010OT genetic silencing causes decreased SOX2 expression in A549 lung cells. Additionally, an unexpected decrease of the expression of transcription factor GLI\u20101, at both mRNA and protein levels, was also confirmed on A549 and NCI\u2010H1975 lung cells. Regarding SOX2\u2010OT functionality, previous studies have reported a ceRNA activity. Evidence suggests that SOX2\u2010OT is involved in promoting/protecting the positive expression/translation of SOX2 in bladder carcinomas, where SOX2\u2010OT has been mainly identified in the cytoplasm. Positive regulation of SOX2 gene expression by LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT could also be the result of sponging activity targeting miR\u2010200c (miR200 subfamily members) [15], which has been detected in pancreatic ductal carcinomas [64]. On the other hand, during mouse cerebral cortex development, Sox2\u2010ot negatively regulates Sox2 expression, due to its interaction with the multifunctional transcription factor YY1, allowing its binding to promoter CpG islands within Sox2 gene locus [12]. Furthermore, our results suggest that LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT modulates the expression of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 trinomial axis, promoting changes in the histone code H3K4me3/H3K27Ac/H3K9me3/H3K27me3 at gene promoter sequences in lung cancer. However, additional studies will be necessary to confirm and validate epigenetic and nonepigenetic mechanisms involved in SOX2\u2010OT\u2010dependent SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 axis genetic expression.\n      Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 trinomial axis, at transcripts/proteins levels in lung cancer patients, occurs independently of risk\u2010factor exposure (tobacco smoking/wood smoke exposure).\n      Similar results have reported a prognostic role for SOX2\u2010OT in malignant diseases, with a meta\u2010analysis which indicates that increased SOX2\u2010OT expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS), and short disease\u2010free survival (DFS) in osteosarcoma and gastric cancer patients [32]. In the case of lung cancer, some studies have previously reported that SOX2\u2010OT overexpression is associated with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting a role as an independent prognostic factor, though the data remain inconclusive thus far [22, 32]. The MTA3/SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2 axis has been involved as a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcomes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients [40]. Results from our study confirm that overexpressed LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT is involved in the control of SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 axis expression, as probable key archetypes, including as \u2018scaffold\u2019 to RNA\u2010binding protein (RBP) [65], and ceRNA function reported on SOX2\u2010targeting miR200c [15], or hypothetically involved in ceRNA activity on miR326 [66], or miR218 [67] whose miRNAs are involved in GLI\u20101\u2010targeting. Some of these functional archetypes have been shown or suggested to participate in therapy resistance and clinical prognosis in lung cancer, as it has been previously reported [68]. In addition, recent evidences have demonstrated that, epigenetically, GLI1\u2010AS up\u2010regulates GLI\u20101 gene expression [34], and is also associated with poor overall survival, and involved in failure response to cisplatin\u2010 and EGFR\u2010TKIs\u2010based therapy in lung cancer disease [28].\n5\n      Conclusion\n      In lung cancer cells, the high co\u2010expression of the SOX2\u2010OT/SOX2/GLI\u20101 axis occurs by epigenetic influence functionality in a histone code\u2010dependent manner at gene promoter sequences level. Likewise, LncRNA SOX2\u2010OT promotes a functional modulation of the EGFR\u2010AKT\u2010ERK expression\u2010activation, promoting resistance to cisplatin/EGFR\u2010TKI\u2010erlotinib therapy, determining poorer overall survival of lung cancer patients.\nConflict of interest\n      The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nAuthor contributions\n      FA\u2010M designed the study.
