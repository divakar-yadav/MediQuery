    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      Non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for almost 80% of lung cancers, including several histological subtypes of lung cancers, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.1 Every year, 1.4 million people die from lung cancer worldwide.2 It is the leading cause of tumor\u2010induced death in men (28%), and in women, it has surpassed breast cancer as the most common cancer\u2010related death (26%).3 In recent years, although conventional treatment therapies like surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have made great progress, the overall 5\u2010year survival rate is still only 15%.4 The emergence of targeted therapy has brought about revolutionary changes in the treatment of lung cancer, and has significantly increased the survival time of patients with EGFR mutations.5, 6 While the targeted therapy had an initial response that lasted for almost 1\u00a0year, later, most patients acquired resistance. The abnormal cell cycle regulation in cancer has been researched extensively. Some cell cycle inhibitors have been used in clinical application and have achieved success in breast cancer7 and lung cancer.8 These cell cycle inhibitors almost make the proliferating cancer cells into a senescence state through restraining the cell cycle checkpoint from G1\u2010S phase.9 The hot cell cycle inhibitors used in clinical experiments are CDK4/6 inhibitors, like palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib in breast cancer. In our previous research, we used PD 0332991, which enhanced the effect of gefitinib and reversed the acquired resistance caused by cell cycle dysregulation. The experimental results had successfully applied in a lung cancer patient with metastasis to the brain related to gefitinib\u2010acquired resistance.8 A quick, convenient and accurate biomarker of cell cycle dysregulation was lacking to guide the application of cell cycle inhibitors. Therefore, in the present article, we found that the long noncoding RNA HOTAIR may be the ideal marker.\n      Improvements in high\u2010throughput, sequencing\u2010based gene expression profiling technologies and in the field of bioinformatics have enhanced our knowledge of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). The research on lncRNA is associated with tumor metastasis, invasion, cell cycle regulation, and native or acquired drug resistance in various cancers.10, 11, 12 However, there is little research on lncRNA in lung cancer. The length of lncRNA is more than 200 nucleotides, and it has no protein\u2010coding function.13 According to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project Consortium (GENCODE release 23), the human genome contains more than 28\u00a0000 sorts of lncRNA, encoded by approximately 16\u00a0000 genes.14 This type of RNA functions in 3 ways to regulate cellular processes. First, lncRNA regulates the intrachromosomal genes (cis or trans) in different chromosomes to influence transcription.14 Second, lncRNA can interact with proteins, affect the interaction between different proteins, or directly localize in cellular compartments to affect cell proliferation and metastasis.15 Third, lncRNA can affect mRNA stability, translation and splicing to modulate RNA metabolism and affect the function of mRNA.16\n\n      We focused our research on an lncRNA called HOTAIR (HOX antisense intergenic RNA), discovered by John L. Rinn in 2007.17 The length of HOTAIR is 2158 nucleotides, and it has only a single strand. HOTAIR5\u2032 is located in 1\u2010300\u00a0nt and HOTAIR3\u2032 is located in 1417\u20102064\u00a0nt. The former bands polycomb\u2010repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to trimethylate H3K27 and silences the homeobox D (HOXD) locus. In recent years, HOTAIR has been found to be associated with tumor metastasis and patient prognosis. In breast cancer, high HOTAIR expression in the breast cancer cell line can promote metastasis and invasion through silencing the HOXD cluster.11 In ovarian cancer, HOTAIR may be used as a prognostic biomarker of tumorigenesis and an early diagnostic marker.12 In glioblastoma, the expression of HOTAIR indicates a short anticipated life expectancy for the patient, but it may also be a promising therapeutic target point.10 Less research has been done on the role of HOTAIR in non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no research has indicated it to be a cell cycle dysregulation biomarker. In the present article, we aim to demonstrate that HOTAIR is an ideal indicator of cell cycle dysregulation in NSCLC. We show that HOTAIR and its 2 segments, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032, promote the cell cycle passing through the restriction point during G1 phase by regulating Rb\u2010E2F pathway and influence NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT) and \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in\u00a0vitro and vivo. Finally, we show that the high expression of HOTAIR is associated with resistance to gefitinib through dysregulated cell cycle.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Drugs and cells\n        The human NSCLC cell lines 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090, provided by Professor Zhou from Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai, China, were used for experiments. 95C and 95D are human giant\u2010cell lung cancer cell lines with low and high metastatic activity, respectively, from the same patient. YTMLC\u201090 is a lung squamous cell line. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco BRL) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. We purchased 3\u2010deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) and tranylcypromine (2PCPA) from Selleck Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX, USA).\n      \n      \n        2.2\n        Antibodies and western blotting\n        Anti\u2010E2F1, anti\u2010Cdk4, anti\u2010Cdk6 and anti\u2010cyclin D antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The other antibodies, anti\u2010P\u2010Ser780 of Rb, anti\u2010P\u2010Ser795 of Rb, anti\u2010phospho\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin (Ser675), anti\u2010phospho\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41), anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin, anti\u2010SIP\u20101, anti\u2010vimentin, anti\u2010N\u2010cadherin, anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin, anti\u2010snail and anti\u2010slug antibodies, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Anti\u2013\u03b2\u2010actin was purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50\u00a0mmol/L Tris\u2010HCl; pH 7.4; 150\u00a0mmol/L NaCl; 1% Nonidet P\u201040; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 1\u00a0mmol/L EDTA; 1\u00a0mmol/L PMSF; 1\u00a0mg/mL aprotinin), and protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, IL, USA). A total of 10 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg of protein was fractionated on 10% to 12% SDS\u2010PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) under wet conditions, then immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies.\n      \n      \n        2.3\n        Reverse transcription and quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction analysis\n        Total RNA was isolated from mesenchymal stem cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the M\u2010MLV Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real\u2010time PCR analysis was done using SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI) in the ABI7500 Real\u2010Time PCR System according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was run in triplicate for each gene. Transcription levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene phosphoglycerate kinase and analyzed using the relative quantification 2\u2212\u25b5\u25b5Ct method. All gene primers were obtained from SBS (Beijing, China). The primers are listed in Table\u00a0S1. All cells used in this experiment transfected with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 had stable expression status (see Table\u00a0S2).\n      \n      \n        2.4\n        Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle\n        To determine the function of HOTAIR, HOTAIRsi, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 in the cell cycle, the 3 NSCLC cell lines (95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090) were transfected with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032. This was achieved by starving the cells in serum\u2010free DMEM for 24\u00a0hours. The cells were then fixed in 70% ice\u2010cold ethanol overnight and subsequently treated with DNase\u2010free ribonuclease (TAKARA Bio, Shiga, Japan), stained with propidium iodide (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, MO China), and subjected to a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences USA). The data were analyzed using ModFit LT software (Topsham, ME, USA).\n      \n      \n        2.5\n        5\u2010ethynyl\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine staining\n        5\u2010ethynyl\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine (EdU) staining detected the S phase of the cell cycle by incorporating the nucleoside analog uridine into newly synthesized DNA strands. A CellLight EdU stain kit was purchased from RiboBio, Guangzhou, China and staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were labeled in culture with 50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L EdU for 2\u00a0hours, washed twice using PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After penetration using 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 and washing with PBS, the proliferated cells were treated with Apollo stain to detect EdU incorporation during DNA synthesis. The analysis was performed on fluorescence microscopes using single interference filter sets for red (Apollo), which stained EdU\u2010labeled cells, and blue (Hoechst 33342), which stained all cell nuclei.\n      \n      \n        2.6\n        Transwell assay\n        The invasion and migration of Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 in NSCLC cells were assessed using a 24\u2010well Transwell insert; some were coated with Matrigel, and some were not. The upper chamber of the Transwell insert was seeded with 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells in serum\u2010free medium. The lower chamber was filled with medium supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 48\u00a0hours of incubation, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab, and cells that invaded through the filter or Matrigel sticked to the lower surface of the filter, were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and counted under a light microscope.\n      \n      \n        2.7\n        Luciferase reporter assay\n        CDK4, cyclin D1, Snail and E\u2010cadherin wild type with designed lncRNA HOTAIR binding sites or mutant sequences with target sites deletion were constructed and amplified and cloned into the pRL\u2010TK plasmid (Promega) vector. 95C cells (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells/well) were seeded into 96\u2010well plates. Cells were cotransfected with luciferase plasmids (0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/well) and lncRNA HOTAIR mimics or controls. After 48\u2010hour transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual\u2010Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).\n      \n      \n        2.8\n        Chromatin isolation by RNA purification\n        The chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) experiment was performed essentially as per the original protocol described previously.18ChIRP probes: ChIRP odd: tttgttccgggaactgccgccttgctccctt gcctgcatttctctgcgtg; ChIRP even: gtccatgggttccgtgtagacgccgccatattttacagtccaaaggaa. The primers of CDK4, cyclin D1, Snail and E\u2010cadherin are listed in Table\u00a0S1.\n      \n      \n        2.9\n        Orthotopic nude mouse model and treatment\n        BALB/c nude mice, 4 to 5\u00a0weeks of age, were obtained from the Chinese Military Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. All mice were maintained under specific\u2010pathogen\u2010free conditions and were examined prior to the initiation of studies to ensure that they were healthy and acclimated to the laboratory environment. To establish intrapulmonary tumors, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 95C and 95D cells with stable expression of Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 were transduced with luciferase lentivirus mixed in 30 uL medium; the mixture was implanted into the right lung of each nude mouse. Mice were imaged for Fluc activity using bioluminescence imaging on postimplantation days 7, 14 and 21.\n      \n      \n        2.10\n        Immunohistochemistry\n        Serial 4\u2010mm sections from paraffin\u2010embedded conventional tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in a series of graded alcohols. Heat\u2010induced antigen retrieval was carried out by microwave pretreatment in 5\u00a0mmol/L Tris\u2010HCl, pH 10.0, for 15\u00a0min. An overnight incubation was carried out at 4\u00b0C using the primary antibodies (anti\u2010Ki67, 1:500 dilution; anti\u2010Rb, 1:100 dilution; anti\u2010P\u2010Rb (S795), 1:200 dilution; anti\u2010CDK4, 1:400 dilution; anti\u2010CDK6, 1:100 dilution; anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin, 1:200 dilution; at\u2010N\u2010cadherin, 1:400 dilution and anti\u2010slug or anti\u2010snail, 1:200 dilution). Appropriate positive and negative controls were used for each experiment.\n        The Kawai method was used to calculate a semiquantitative score, from 1 to 16, for staining of each tissue core. The percentage of positive cells were estimated and assigned a number: 1, <25%; 2, 25% to 50%; 3, 50% to 75%; 4, >75%. The intensity of staining was determined as 1, none; 2, weak; 3, intermediate; and 4, strong. The first and second scores were then multiplied, resulting in a maximum staining score of 16. Results were analyzed using Wilcoxon statistics, which corrected for agreement by chance, and by percent agreement.\n      \n      \n        2.11\n        Enrichment analyses\n        The enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG pathways for differentially expressed gene (DEG) sets were completed using DAVID web servers and the Cytoscape app. We used the clueGO app to exhibit KEGG pathway analysis.\n      \n      \n        2.12\n        Statistical analysis\n        All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 15.0.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Student's t test was used to identify statistical significance. ANOVA was used to analyze more than 2 groups of data for all experiments. Statistical significance was defined as a P\u2010value of <0.05.\n2.1\n        Drugs and cells\n        The human NSCLC cell lines 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090, provided by Professor Zhou from Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai, China, were used for experiments. 95C and 95D are human giant\u2010cell lung cancer cell lines with low and high metastatic activity, respectively, from the same patient.

To establish intrapulmonary tumors, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 95C and 95D cells with stable expression of Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 were transduced with luciferase lentivirus mixed in 30 uL medium; the mixture was implanted into the right lung of each nude mouse. Mice were imaged for Fluc activity using bioluminescence imaging on postimplantation days 7, 14 and 21.\n2.10\n        Immunohistochemistry\n        Serial 4\u2010mm sections from paraffin\u2010embedded conventional tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in a series of graded alcohols. Heat\u2010induced antigen retrieval was carried out by microwave pretreatment in 5\u00a0mmol/L Tris\u2010HCl, pH 10.0, for 15\u00a0min. An overnight incubation was carried out at 4\u00b0C using the primary antibodies (anti\u2010Ki67, 1:500 dilution; anti\u2010Rb, 1:100 dilution; anti\u2010P\u2010Rb (S795), 1:200 dilution; anti\u2010CDK4, 1:400 dilution; anti\u2010CDK6, 1:100 dilution; anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin, 1:200 dilution; at\u2010N\u2010cadherin, 1:400 dilution and anti\u2010slug or anti\u2010snail, 1:200 dilution). Appropriate positive and negative controls were used for each experiment.\n        The Kawai method was used to calculate a semiquantitative score, from 1 to 16, for staining of each tissue core. The percentage of positive cells were estimated and assigned a number: 1, <25%; 2, 25% to 50%; 3, 50% to 75%; 4, >75%. The intensity of staining was determined as 1, none; 2, weak; 3, intermediate; and 4, strong. The first and second scores were then multiplied, resulting in a maximum staining score of 16. Results were analyzed using Wilcoxon statistics, which corrected for agreement by chance, and by percent agreement.\n2.11\n        Enrichment analyses\n        The enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG pathways for differentially expressed gene (DEG) sets were completed using DAVID web servers and the Cytoscape app. We used the clueGO app to exhibit KEGG pathway analysis.\n2.12\n        Statistical analysis\n        All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 15.0.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Student's t test was used to identify statistical significance. ANOVA was used to analyze more than 2 groups of data for all experiments. Statistical significance was defined as a P\u2010value of <0.05.\n3\n      RESULTS\n      \n        3.1\n        Clinical data analysis showed HOTAIR, HORAIR3\u2032 and HORAIR5\u2032 associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis through the regulation of the cell cycle in lung cancer\n        Through the analysis of data in the TCGA public database of lung cancer, we found that almost all lung cancer primary tumors had high expression levels of HOTAIR, while in normal lung cancer tissue, expression levels were lower (Figure\u00a01A). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis undertaken using DAVID web server19 indicated that the lncRNA HOTAIR tend to be involved in several signaling pathways (cell cycle, base excision repair, DNA replication, progesterone\u2010mediated oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis, Fanconi anemia pathway, homologous recombination and p53 signaling pathway). Among these pathways, the cell cycle pathway is the most relevant path (Figure\u00a01B). We gathered lung cancer tissue samples from 67 patients (48 men and 19 women) in our department, with corresponding pericarcinous tissues. The pathological structure including squamous carcinoma in 31, adenocarcinoma in 28, adenosquamous carcinoma in 2, small cell lung cancer in 2, large cell lung cancer in 1, transitional cell carcinoma in 1, and undifferentiated carcinoma in 2. Real\u2010time PCR was used to detect the expression of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 in our collected lung cancer samples. Surprisingly, in the 40 cycles of PCR, only 42.65%, 38.23% and 48.52% of pericarcinous tissue samples were positive for HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032, respectively, while 100% of lung cancer could be detected using these 3 primers (Figure\u00a01C). In the 67 patients\u2019 lung cancer issues, we used the B2B cell, a normal bronchial epithelial cell, as a control to analyze expression of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 from these samples to find any correlation with the degree of pathological differentiation. The tumor pathological grade was divided into 5 degrees: high, high\u2010middle, middle, middle\u2010low and low. Experimental results demonstrated that HOTAIR and its 2 segments, 3\u2032 and 5\u2032, were all negatively correlated with the degree of pathological differentiation. The low\u2010differentiation specimen had high expression of HOTAIR and its 2 segments, while the high\u2010differentiation specimen had the lowest expression level of HOTAIR and its 2 segments; this latter difference was significant when compared with the other 4 degrees (Figure\u00a01D). In the extracted RNA from different lung cancer cell lines, H292, a cell line derived from a lymph node metastasis of a pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma, showed obviously high expression of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 compared with other cell lines (Figure\u00a0S1A). We believe this proves that lncRNA HOTAIR is a marker that indicates the dysregulation of the cell cycle and may be associated with tumor pathological grade and metastasis.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Clinical data analysis shows HOTAIR, HORAIR3\u2032 and HORAIR5\u2032 associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis through the regulation of the cell cycle in lung cancer.

B, KEGG pathway analysis of HOTAIR in TCGA public database of lung cancer. C, The expression level of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 in lung cancer carcinoma tissues and pericarcinous tissues. D, The expression levels negatively associated with degrees of pathological differentiation. (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05)\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.2\n        HOTAIR and its 2 segments promote lung cancer progression through the regulation of cell cycle\n        In the previous subsection part, HOTAIR and its 2 segments were identified as being associated with lung cancer progression. The TCGA database had also given us a hint that the function of HOTAIR and its 2 segments were correlated with cell cycle. In this subsection we describe how we treated the NSCLC cell, 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 and used propidium iodide staining to assess the cell stages. Compared with NSCLC cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, those treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 had a much lower percentage in the G1 phase. The G1 phase of 95C cells decreased by 14.93%, 15.88% and 7.38% in Lenti\u2010HOTAIR\u2010, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032\u2010 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032\u2010treated cells, respectively. Similarly, in 95D cells, the percentage of G1 decrease was 16.71%, 18%, and 7%, respectively; in YTMLC\u201090 cells, the percentage decrease was 12.45%, 15.27%, and 6.39%. As we predicted, the G1% in Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi\u2010treated cells increased compared with Lenti\u2010NC by approximately 4.66%, 3.09% and 7.82% (Figure\u00a02A). Therefore, we could conclude that HOTAIR promotes the cell cycle and facilitates NSCLC proliferation. However, when we knocked down the expression of HOTAIR, the percentage of the G1 phase increased and inhibited the cell cycle progression. In the NSCLC cells, we identified that HOTAIR could promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Maybe, it could be a promise cell cycle inhibitor targeted point to treat lung cancer in the future.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            \nHOTAIR HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 regulates non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell cycle progression in\u00a0vitro. A, The cell cycle distribution of 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032, respectively. B, HOTAIR HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 promote the expression of P\u2010Rb (S780), P\u2010Rb (S795), CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 compared with control, while the NSCLC cell transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi had the opposite results. C, Luciferase activity (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03) in 95C cells cotransfected with lncRNA mimics and luciferase reporters containing CDK4pro\u2010wt, CDK4pro\u2010mu, cyclin D1pro\u2010wt or cyclin D1pro\u2010mu. D, Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assay using biotin\u2010labeled HOTAIR\u2010specific DNA probe and streptavidin beads in 95C cells, followed by qPCR analysis with Snail and E\u2010cadherin (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03). NC, negative control\n          \n          \n        \n        To test the mechanisms underlying the changes from G1 to S phase in NSCLC cells, we performed western blotting to show the different protein expressions at the G1\u2010S restriction point. The tumor suppressor Rb plays a major role in regulating the transition from G1 to S phase,20, 21 functioning through its phosphorylation by separation of CDK4/6 and CYCLIN D1.22, 23 The NSCLC cell lines treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti_HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 had increased protein levels of P\u2010Rb (S780) and P\u2010Rb (S795) compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. The expression of CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 was higher in cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and its 2 segments compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. However, E2F1 showed almost no change. The NSCLC cells with HOTAIR knockdown showed the opposite results (Figure\u00a02B).\n        Moreover, we performed luciferase reporter assays using vectors containing CDK4 pro\u2010wt, CDK4 pro\u2010mu, cyclin D1 pro\u2010wt or cyclin D1 pro\u2010mu. We found that overexpression of HOTAIR greatly increased the luciferase activity of CDK4pro\u2010wt and cyclin D1pro\u2010wt reporter vector. However, knockdown HOTAIR expression decreased the transcriptional activity of CDK4pro\u2010wt and cyclin D1 pro\u2010wt reporter vector, similar to the observation that mutation of HOTAIR on CDK4 and cyclin D1 eliminated the repressive or promoted effect exerted by HOTAIR (Figure\u00a02C). To confirm the interaction between HOTAIR and CDK4, cyclin D1, we carried out ChIRP chromatin isolation. The results showed that HOTAIR transcript was present in the promoter region of CDK4 and cyclin D1 and promoted the expression of them (Figure\u00a02D).\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        HOTAIR also regulates non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer proliferation, migration and invasion through epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in\u00a0vitro\n        HOTAIR has demonstrated functions in NSCLC cell cycle regulation and could be an ideal indicator of cell cycle dysregulation. While in the process of this research, we found that the NSCLC cells which transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi showed obvious lower cell proliferation. Therefore, we believe that the downstream pathway of the cell cycle could affect NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In this section, we show that HOTAIR could promote NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through EMT and \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. EdU staining analysis was used to determine the function of HOTAIR in the NSCLC cell lines (95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090) by evaluating proliferation in Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR\u2010treated NSCLC cell lines. The results showed that, after Lenti\u2010HOTAIR was used to infect the 3 cell lines, the percentage of EdU\u2010positive cells increased by 24% (95C), 25% (95D) and 15% (YTMLC\u201090) compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. When the 3 cell lines\u2019 HOTAIR expression was knocked down by almost 50% (Figure\u00a0S2), the percentage of EdU\u2010positive cells with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi treatment was 10% (95C), 12% (95D) and 6% (YTMLC\u201090) lower than with Lenti\u2010NC administration (Figure\u00a03A).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            \nHOTAIR promotes proliferation, invasion and migration in non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. A, 5\u2010ethynyl\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were performed on 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells showing increased levels of proliferation upon administration with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and decreased proliferation upon administration with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi compared with control. B, Transwell inserts without Matrigel indicated that HOTAIR promotes NSCLC cell migration and knockdown could inhibit migration. C, Transwell with Matrigel coating showed that HOTAIR promotes NSCLC cell invasion and knockdown HOTAIR could suppress invasion. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03 independent experiments) *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, compared with the control group\n          \n          \n        \n        To identify the function of HOTAIR in migration, we used Transwell experiment while the transwell had no Matrgel covered. Cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR showed increased cell numbers migrating through the membrane; more than 50% greater migration was seen than with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. Cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi had 15% less cell migration in the 3 NSCLC cell lines (Figure\u00a03B).\n        Transwells with Matrigel coating were used to identify whether HOTAIR was associated with NSCLC cell invasion. The 3 cell lines treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR showed a 12% (95C), 30% (95D) and 50% (YTMLC\u201090) increase in cell numbers migrating through the membrane compared with the Lenti\u2010NC group. Simultaneously, the 3 cells with downregulated HOTAIR expression showed decreased cell numbers migrating through the Transwell membrane (Figure\u00a03C).\n        The biological behavior described above may be a result of EMT and activation of the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. To identify the mechanism by which HOTAIR promoted proliferation, migration and invasion, western blotting and TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids have been used in the present study. We treated 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and observed significant changes in EMT\u2010related markers compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. Among the EMT\u2010related markers, SIP\u20101, vimentin, N\u2010cadherin, snail and slug showed increased expression, while E\u2010cadherin decreased. With knockdown HOTAIR expression in these cells, the markers associated with EMT showed the reverse expression pattern. Although some markers did not demonstrate very obvious changes in Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi\u2010treated cells, we still came to the conclusion that the function of HOTAIR is associated with EMT (Figure\u00a04A). Except for the results for EMT, the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway also showed obvious changes. Western blotting showed that the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway was activated in the scenario of high HOTAIR expression, but the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, which had been identified as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, is opposite to \u03b2\u2010catenin. To further understand the role of the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in both high HOTAIR expression and HOTAIR knockdown cells, we used TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids to detect \u03b2\u2010catenin. The activation of the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in Lenti\u2010HOTAIR\u2010treated cells was higher than that of Lenti\u2010NC cells (Figure\u00a04D,E).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            The mechanisms of HOTAIR promote non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, invasion and migration. A, Western blot analysis shows the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT) maker changes in 95C, 95D, YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi. C, Luciferase activity (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03) in 95C cells cotransfected with lncRNA mimics and luciferase reporters containing Snail pro\u2010wt, Snail pro\u2010mu, E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010wt or E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010mu. D, ChIRP assay using biotin\u2010labeled HOTAIR\u2010specific DNA probe and streptavidin beads in 95C cells, followed by qPCR analysis with Snail and E\u2010cadherin (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03). NC, negative control. D, Western blot shows the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway changes in NSCLC cells administration with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and HOTAIRsi, respectively. E, TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids performed to detect activation of \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway associated with HOTAIR\n          \n          \n        \n        We also performed luciferase reporter assays using vectors containing Snail pro\u2010wt, Snail pro\u2010mu, E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010wt or E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010mu. The results showed that overexpression of HOTAIR greatly increased the luciferase activity of snail pro\u2010wt but decreased E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010wt reporter vector. However, when knocked down HOTAIR expression had the opposite effects (Figure\u00a04B). To confirm the interaction between HOTAIR and Snail or E\u2010cadherin, we carried out ChIRP chromatin isolation. The results showed that HOTAIR transcript was present in the promoter region of Snail and E\u2010cadherin, but had different effects (Figure\u00a04B,C).\n      \n      \n        3.4\n        HOTAIR3\u2032 can potently promote non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer cell proliferation, migration and\u00a0invasion compared with HOTAIR5\u2032\n        The single\u2010stranded lncRNA can be analyzed by dividing it into 2 segments, 3\u2032 and 5\u2032. We aimed to determine exactly which part of lncRNA HOTAIR promotes proliferation, migration and invasion most potently. We transfected HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 into NSCLC cells and analyzed the effect of the 2 segments. EdU assay showed that Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 transfection in the 3 NSCLC cell lines can potently increase tumor cell proliferation compared with HOTAIR3\u2032. In 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032, the capacity of proliferation was increased by 25%, 24% and 11%, respectively, compared with the control. The 3 cell lines transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 increased their capacity for proliferation by 14%, 4% and 10%, respectively, compared with the control (Figure\u00a05A). For migration and invasion, HOTAIR3\u2032 may be stronger than HOTAIR5\u2032. In Transwell\u2010assessed migration, the NSCLC cell line transfected with HOTAIR3\u2032 showed an increased number of cells migrating through the membrane by more than 24%, 16% and 16% compared with NSCLC cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR 5\u2032 (Figure\u00a05B). We found that the invasion ability in 95C and YTMLC\u201090 cells was affected by HOTAIR3\u2032 more strongly than by HOTAIR5\u2032. However, 95D cells were different: HOTAIR5\u2032 was stronger than HOTAIR3\u2032 (Figure\u00a05C).\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            \nHOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 promotes proliferation, invasion and migration in non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. A, EdU assays were performed on NSCLC cells, showing that HOTAIR5\u2032 may promote proliferation more than HOTAIR3\u2032. B, Transwell inserts without Matrigel indicated that HOTAIR3\u2032 promotes NSCLC cell migration more than HOTAIR 5\u2032. C, Transwell with Matrigel coating showed that HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 could both promote invasion in NSCLC cells. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03 independent experiments); *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, compared with the control group\n          \n          \n        \n        Similar to the detection of the mechanism of HOTAIR described above, we also performed western blotting and TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmid testing to identify the mechanism associated with EMT and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. On western blotting, both the Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032\u2010treated and the Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032\u2010treated NCSLC cell line showed increased expression of EMT\u2010associated markers SIP\u20101, vimentin, N\u2010cadherin, snail and slug, while E\u2010cadherin decreased (Figure\u00a06A). Similarly, both the Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032\u2010treated and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032\u2010treated cell lines had increased expression of proteins in the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway, such as \u03b2\u2010catenin, P\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin (Ser675) and P\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41), but decreased expression of APC (Figure\u00a06B). Western blotting showed that the function of HOTAIR3\u2032 may be more important than that of HOTAIR5\u2032. The TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmid supported our conclusions (Figure\u00a06C). In the 3 NSCLC cell lines, cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 can potently activate \u03b2\u2010catenin transcriptional activity compared with cells transfected by Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 (Figure\u00a06C).\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            The mechanisms of HOTAIR promote non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, invasion and migration.

B, Western blot shows the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway changes in NSCLC cells administered with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032, respectively. C, TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids detected activation of \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway associated with HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 (black represents FOP\u2010Flash; white represents TOP\u2010Flash)\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.5\n        In orthotopic non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer cell mouse model, HOTAIR, HOTAIRsi, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 affect tumor growth\n        To verify the function of HOTAIR and its 2 segments in\u00a0vivo, we established lung cancer orthotopic mouse models using 95C and 95D cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032. The process of establishment of a mouse model is shown in the Materials and Methods (Figure\u00a07A). In these models, cells with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 showed more obvious tumor growth than those treated with Lenti\u2010NC at 21\u00a0days. The tumor volume grew more slowly in the Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi lung cancer model than in the control. Cells transfected with HOTAIR3\u2032 had the fastest growth (Figure\u00a07B,C, Figure\u00a0S3A). The function of HOTAIR3\u2032 was stronger than that of HOTAIR and HOTAIR5\u2032. To identify the function of HOTAIR associated with EMT and the cell cycle, we performed immunohistochemistry to show the change in associated markers in lung cancer orthotopic tumors. The results showed that Ki\u201067, P\u2010Rb (S795), CDK4, CDK6, N\u2010cadherin and snail/slug were highly expressed high in HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 transfected group compared with control, while the orthotopic NSCLC model transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi had shown increased expression of Rb and E\u2010cadherin (Figure\u00a07E). This is in accordance with the results in\u00a0vitro.\n        \n          Figure 7\n          \n            \nHOTAIR, HOTAIRsi, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 affect tumor growth in the 95C and 95D orthotopic non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model in\u00a0vivo.

As shown in Figure\u00a08A, B, the tumor tissues of NSCLC patients were all in phase IV, had EGFR mutations, and had received gefitinib treatment. Patient 2, who had high expression of HOTAIR, developed gefitinib resistance after only 5\u00a0months of treatment, which was much less than the median time of 12\u00a0months. Previous data had shown that lncRNA HOTAIR is associated with the cell cycle pathway. Further analysis of the TCGA public database of lung cancer showed that HOTAIR is positively correlated with E2F1, CDK4 and CDK6 (Figure\u00a08C).\n        \n          Figure 8\n          \n            The expression of HOTAIR in 4 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.

D, Four lung cancer patients\u2019 IHC results for Rb and P\u2010Rb\n          \n          \n        \n        Immunohistochemical results for the 4 patients\u2019 surgical tissues showed that No. 2 patient had higher expression of Rb and P\u2010Rb than the other 3 patients (Figure\u00a08D). However, due to the limited patient samples, it is impossible to determine whether HOTAIR expression is correlated with the timing of EGFR\u2010TKI resistance caused by dysregulation of the cell cycle.\n3.1\n        Clinical data analysis showed HOTAIR, HORAIR3\u2032 and HORAIR5\u2032 associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis through the regulation of the cell cycle in lung cancer\n        Through the analysis of data in the TCGA public database of lung cancer, we found that almost all lung cancer primary tumors had high expression levels of HOTAIR, while in normal lung cancer tissue, expression levels were lower (Figure\u00a01A). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis undertaken using DAVID web server19 indicated that the lncRNA HOTAIR tend to be involved in several signaling pathways (cell cycle, base excision repair, DNA replication, progesterone\u2010mediated oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis, Fanconi anemia pathway, homologous recombination and p53 signaling pathway). Among these pathways, the cell cycle pathway is the most relevant path (Figure\u00a01B). We gathered lung cancer tissue samples from 67 patients (48 men and 19 women) in our department, with corresponding pericarcinous tissues. The pathological structure including squamous carcinoma in 31, adenocarcinoma in 28, adenosquamous carcinoma in 2, small cell lung cancer in 2, large cell lung cancer in 1, transitional cell carcinoma in 1, and undifferentiated carcinoma in 2. Real\u2010time PCR was used to detect the expression of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 in our collected lung cancer samples. Surprisingly, in the 40 cycles of PCR, only 42.65%, 38.23% and 48.52% of pericarcinous tissue samples were positive for HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032, respectively, while 100% of lung cancer could be detected using these 3 primers (Figure\u00a01C). In the 67 patients\u2019 lung cancer issues, we used the B2B cell, a normal bronchial epithelial cell, as a control to analyze expression of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 from these samples to find any correlation with the degree of pathological differentiation. The tumor pathological grade was divided into 5 degrees: high, high\u2010middle, middle, middle\u2010low and low. Experimental results demonstrated that HOTAIR and its 2 segments, 3\u2032 and 5\u2032, were all negatively correlated with the degree of pathological differentiation. The low\u2010differentiation specimen had high expression of HOTAIR and its 2 segments, while the high\u2010differentiation specimen had the lowest expression level of HOTAIR and its 2 segments; this latter difference was significant when compared with the other 4 degrees (Figure\u00a01D). In the extracted RNA from different lung cancer cell lines, H292, a cell line derived from a lymph node metastasis of a pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma, showed obviously high expression of HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 compared with other cell lines (Figure\u00a0S1A). We believe this proves that lncRNA HOTAIR is a marker that indicates the dysregulation of the cell cycle and may be associated with tumor pathological grade and metastasis.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Clinical data analysis shows HOTAIR, HORAIR3\u2032 and HORAIR5\u2032 associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis through the regulation of the cell cycle in lung cancer.

(P\u00a0<\u00a00.05)\n3.2\n        HOTAIR and its 2 segments promote lung cancer progression through the regulation of cell cycle\n        In the previous subsection part, HOTAIR and its 2 segments were identified as being associated with lung cancer progression. The TCGA database had also given us a hint that the function of HOTAIR and its 2 segments were correlated with cell cycle. In this subsection we describe how we treated the NSCLC cell, 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 and used propidium iodide staining to assess the cell stages. Compared with NSCLC cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, those treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 had a much lower percentage in the G1 phase. The G1 phase of 95C cells decreased by 14.93%, 15.88% and 7.38% in Lenti\u2010HOTAIR\u2010, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032\u2010 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032\u2010treated cells, respectively. Similarly, in 95D cells, the percentage of G1 decrease was 16.71%, 18%, and 7%, respectively; in YTMLC\u201090 cells, the percentage decrease was 12.45%, 15.27%, and 6.39%. As we predicted, the G1% in Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi\u2010treated cells increased compared with Lenti\u2010NC by approximately 4.66%, 3.09% and 7.82% (Figure\u00a02A). Therefore, we could conclude that HOTAIR promotes the cell cycle and facilitates NSCLC proliferation. However, when we knocked down the expression of HOTAIR, the percentage of the G1 phase increased and inhibited the cell cycle progression. In the NSCLC cells, we identified that HOTAIR could promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Maybe, it could be a promise cell cycle inhibitor targeted point to treat lung cancer in the future.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            \nHOTAIR HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 regulates non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell cycle progression in\u00a0vitro. A, The cell cycle distribution of 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032, respectively. B, HOTAIR HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 promote the expression of P\u2010Rb (S780), P\u2010Rb (S795), CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 compared with control, while the NSCLC cell transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi had the opposite results. C, Luciferase activity (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03) in 95C cells cotransfected with lncRNA mimics and luciferase reporters containing CDK4pro\u2010wt, CDK4pro\u2010mu, cyclin D1pro\u2010wt or cyclin D1pro\u2010mu. D, Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assay using biotin\u2010labeled HOTAIR\u2010specific DNA probe and streptavidin beads in 95C cells, followed by qPCR analysis with Snail and E\u2010cadherin (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03). NC, negative control\n          \n          \n        \n        To test the mechanisms underlying the changes from G1 to S phase in NSCLC cells, we performed western blotting to show the different protein expressions at the G1\u2010S restriction point. The tumor suppressor Rb plays a major role in regulating the transition from G1 to S phase,20, 21 functioning through its phosphorylation by separation of CDK4/6 and CYCLIN D1.22, 23 The NSCLC cell lines treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti_HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 had increased protein levels of P\u2010Rb (S780) and P\u2010Rb (S795) compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. The expression of CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 was higher in cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and its 2 segments compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. However, E2F1 showed almost no change. The NSCLC cells with HOTAIR knockdown showed the opposite results (Figure\u00a02B).\n        Moreover, we performed luciferase reporter assays using vectors containing CDK4 pro\u2010wt, CDK4 pro\u2010mu, cyclin D1 pro\u2010wt or cyclin D1 pro\u2010mu. We found that overexpression of HOTAIR greatly increased the luciferase activity of CDK4pro\u2010wt and cyclin D1pro\u2010wt reporter vector. However, knockdown HOTAIR expression decreased the transcriptional activity of CDK4pro\u2010wt and cyclin D1 pro\u2010wt reporter vector, similar to the observation that mutation of HOTAIR on CDK4 and cyclin D1 eliminated the repressive or promoted effect exerted by HOTAIR (Figure\u00a02C). To confirm the interaction between HOTAIR and CDK4, cyclin D1, we carried out ChIRP chromatin isolation. The results showed that HOTAIR transcript was present in the promoter region of CDK4 and cyclin D1 and promoted the expression of them (Figure\u00a02D).\n3.3\n        HOTAIR also regulates non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer proliferation, migration and invasion through epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in\u00a0vitro\n        HOTAIR has demonstrated functions in NSCLC cell cycle regulation and could be an ideal indicator of cell cycle dysregulation. While in the process of this research, we found that the NSCLC cells which transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi showed obvious lower cell proliferation. Therefore, we believe that the downstream pathway of the cell cycle could affect NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In this section, we show that HOTAIR could promote NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through EMT and \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. EdU staining analysis was used to determine the function of HOTAIR in the NSCLC cell lines (95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090) by evaluating proliferation in Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR\u2010treated NSCLC cell lines. The results showed that, after Lenti\u2010HOTAIR was used to infect the 3 cell lines, the percentage of EdU\u2010positive cells increased by 24% (95C), 25% (95D) and 15% (YTMLC\u201090) compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. When the 3 cell lines\u2019 HOTAIR expression was knocked down by almost 50% (Figure\u00a0S2), the percentage of EdU\u2010positive cells with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi treatment was 10% (95C), 12% (95D) and 6% (YTMLC\u201090) lower than with Lenti\u2010NC administration (Figure\u00a03A).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            \nHOTAIR promotes proliferation, invasion and migration in non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. A, 5\u2010ethynyl\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were performed on 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells showing increased levels of proliferation upon administration with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and decreased proliferation upon administration with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi compared with control. B, Transwell inserts without Matrigel indicated that HOTAIR promotes NSCLC cell migration and knockdown could inhibit migration. C, Transwell with Matrigel coating showed that HOTAIR promotes NSCLC cell invasion and knockdown HOTAIR could suppress invasion. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03 independent experiments) *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, compared with the control group\n          \n          \n        \n        To identify the function of HOTAIR in migration, we used Transwell experiment while the transwell had no Matrgel covered. Cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR showed increased cell numbers migrating through the membrane; more than 50% greater migration was seen than with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. Cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi had 15% less cell migration in the 3 NSCLC cell lines (Figure\u00a03B).\n        Transwells with Matrigel coating were used to identify whether HOTAIR was associated with NSCLC cell invasion. The 3 cell lines treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR showed a 12% (95C), 30% (95D) and 50% (YTMLC\u201090) increase in cell numbers migrating through the membrane compared with the Lenti\u2010NC group. Simultaneously, the 3 cells with downregulated HOTAIR expression showed decreased cell numbers migrating through the Transwell membrane (Figure\u00a03C).\n        The biological behavior described above may be a result of EMT and activation of the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. To identify the mechanism by which HOTAIR promoted proliferation, migration and invasion, western blotting and TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids have been used in the present study. We treated 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and observed significant changes in EMT\u2010related markers compared with Lenti\u2010NC\u2010treated cells. Among the EMT\u2010related markers, SIP\u20101, vimentin, N\u2010cadherin, snail and slug showed increased expression, while E\u2010cadherin decreased. With knockdown HOTAIR expression in these cells, the markers associated with EMT showed the reverse expression pattern. Although some markers did not demonstrate very obvious changes in Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi\u2010treated cells, we still came to the conclusion that the function of HOTAIR is associated with EMT (Figure\u00a04A). Except for the results for EMT, the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway also showed obvious changes. Western blotting showed that the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway was activated in the scenario of high HOTAIR expression, but the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, which had been identified as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, is opposite to \u03b2\u2010catenin. To further understand the role of the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in both high HOTAIR expression and HOTAIR knockdown cells, we used TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids to detect \u03b2\u2010catenin. The activation of the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway in Lenti\u2010HOTAIR\u2010treated cells was higher than that of Lenti\u2010NC cells (Figure\u00a04D,E).\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            The mechanisms of HOTAIR promote non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, invasion and migration. A, Western blot analysis shows the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT) maker changes in 95C, 95D, YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi. C, Luciferase activity (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03) in 95C cells cotransfected with lncRNA mimics and luciferase reporters containing Snail pro\u2010wt, Snail pro\u2010mu, E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010wt or E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010mu. D, ChIRP assay using biotin\u2010labeled HOTAIR\u2010specific DNA probe and streptavidin beads in 95C cells, followed by qPCR analysis with Snail and E\u2010cadherin (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a03). NC, negative control. D, Western blot shows the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway changes in NSCLC cells administration with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR and HOTAIRsi, respectively. E, TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids performed to detect activation of \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway associated with HOTAIR\n          \n          \n        \n        We also performed luciferase reporter assays using vectors containing Snail pro\u2010wt, Snail pro\u2010mu, E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010wt or E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010mu. The results showed that overexpression of HOTAIR greatly increased the luciferase activity of snail pro\u2010wt but decreased E\u2010cadherin pro\u2010wt reporter vector. However, when knocked down HOTAIR expression had the opposite effects (Figure\u00a04B). To confirm the interaction between HOTAIR and Snail or E\u2010cadherin, we carried out ChIRP chromatin isolation. The results showed that HOTAIR transcript was present in the promoter region of Snail and E\u2010cadherin, but had different effects (Figure\u00a04B,C).\n3.4\n        HOTAIR3\u2032 can potently promote non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer cell proliferation, migration and\u00a0invasion compared with HOTAIR5\u2032\n        The single\u2010stranded lncRNA can be analyzed by dividing it into 2 segments, 3\u2032 and 5\u2032. We aimed to determine exactly which part of lncRNA HOTAIR promotes proliferation, migration and invasion most potently. We transfected HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 into NSCLC cells and analyzed the effect of the 2 segments. EdU assay showed that Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 transfection in the 3 NSCLC cell lines can potently increase tumor cell proliferation compared with HOTAIR3\u2032. In 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032, the capacity of proliferation was increased by 25%, 24% and 11%, respectively, compared with the control. The 3 cell lines transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 increased their capacity for proliferation by 14%, 4% and 10%, respectively, compared with the control (Figure\u00a05A). For migration and invasion, HOTAIR3\u2032 may be stronger than HOTAIR5\u2032. In Transwell\u2010assessed migration, the NSCLC cell line transfected with HOTAIR3\u2032 showed an increased number of cells migrating through the membrane by more than 24%, 16% and 16% compared with NSCLC cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR 5\u2032 (Figure\u00a05B). We found that the invasion ability in 95C and YTMLC\u201090 cells was affected by HOTAIR3\u2032 more strongly than by HOTAIR5\u2032. However, 95D cells were different: HOTAIR5\u2032 was stronger than HOTAIR3\u2032 (Figure\u00a05C).\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            \nHOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 promotes proliferation, invasion and migration in non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. A, EdU assays were performed on NSCLC cells, showing that HOTAIR5\u2032 may promote proliferation more than HOTAIR3\u2032. B, Transwell inserts without Matrigel indicated that HOTAIR3\u2032 promotes NSCLC cell migration more than HOTAIR 5\u2032. C, Transwell with Matrigel coating showed that HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 could both promote invasion in NSCLC cells. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03 independent experiments); *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, compared with the control group\n          \n          \n        \n        Similar to the detection of the mechanism of HOTAIR described above, we also performed western blotting and TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmid testing to identify the mechanism associated with EMT and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. On western blotting, both the Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032\u2010treated and the Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032\u2010treated NCSLC cell line showed increased expression of EMT\u2010associated markers SIP\u20101, vimentin, N\u2010cadherin, snail and slug, while E\u2010cadherin decreased (Figure\u00a06A). Similarly, both the Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032\u2010treated and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032\u2010treated cell lines had increased expression of proteins in the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway, such as \u03b2\u2010catenin, P\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin (Ser675) and P\u2010\u03b2\u2010catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41), but decreased expression of APC (Figure\u00a06B). Western blotting showed that the function of HOTAIR3\u2032 may be more important than that of HOTAIR5\u2032. The TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmid supported our conclusions (Figure\u00a06C). In the 3 NSCLC cell lines, cells treated with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 can potently activate \u03b2\u2010catenin transcriptional activity compared with cells transfected by Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 (Figure\u00a06C).\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            The mechanisms of HOTAIR promote non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, invasion and migration. A, Western blot analysis shows the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT) maker changes in 95C, 95D and YTMLC\u201090 cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032. B, Western blot shows the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway changes in NSCLC cells administered with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032, respectively. C, TOP/FOP flash reporter plasmids detected activation of \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway associated with HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 (black represents FOP\u2010Flash; white represents TOP\u2010Flash)\n3.5\n        In orthotopic non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer cell mouse model, HOTAIR, HOTAIRsi, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 affect tumor growth\n        To verify the function of HOTAIR and its 2 segments in\u00a0vivo, we established lung cancer orthotopic mouse models using 95C and 95D cells treated with Lenti\u2010NC, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032. The process of establishment of a mouse model is shown in the Materials and Methods (Figure\u00a07A). In these models, cells with Lenti\u2010HOTAIR, Lenti\u2010HOTAIR3\u2032 and Lenti\u2010HOTAIR5\u2032 showed more obvious tumor growth than those treated with Lenti\u2010NC at 21\u00a0days. The tumor volume grew more slowly in the Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi lung cancer model than in the control. Cells transfected with HOTAIR3\u2032 had the fastest growth (Figure\u00a07B,C, Figure\u00a0S3A). The function of HOTAIR3\u2032 was stronger than that of HOTAIR and HOTAIR5\u2032. To identify the function of HOTAIR associated with EMT and the cell cycle, we performed immunohistochemistry to show the change in associated markers in lung cancer orthotopic tumors. The results showed that Ki\u201067, P\u2010Rb (S795), CDK4, CDK6, N\u2010cadherin and snail/slug were highly expressed high in HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 transfected group compared with control, while the orthotopic NSCLC model transfected with Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi had shown increased expression of Rb and E\u2010cadherin (Figure\u00a07E). This is in accordance with the results in\u00a0vitro.\n        \n          Figure 7\n          \n            \nHOTAIR, HOTAIRsi, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 affect tumor growth in the 95C and 95D orthotopic non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model in\u00a0vivo.

As shown in Figure\u00a08A, B, the tumor tissues of NSCLC patients were all in phase IV, had EGFR mutations, and had received gefitinib treatment. Patient 2, who had high expression of HOTAIR, developed gefitinib resistance after only 5\u00a0months of treatment, which was much less than the median time of 12\u00a0months. Previous data had shown that lncRNA HOTAIR is associated with the cell cycle pathway. Further analysis of the TCGA public database of lung cancer showed that HOTAIR is positively correlated with E2F1, CDK4 and CDK6 (Figure\u00a08C).\n        \n          Figure 8\n          \n            The expression of HOTAIR in 4 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.

C, HOTAIR positively related to E2F1, CDK4 and CDK6 from the analysis of TCGA public database of lung cancer. D, Four lung cancer patients\u2019 IHC results for Rb and P\u2010Rb\n          \n          \n        \n        Immunohistochemical results for the 4 patients\u2019 surgical tissues showed that No. 2 patient had higher expression of Rb and P\u2010Rb than the other 3 patients (Figure\u00a08D). However, due to the limited patient samples, it is impossible to determine whether HOTAIR expression is correlated with the timing of EGFR\u2010TKI resistance caused by dysregulation of the cell cycle.\n4\n      DISCUSSION\n      Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in Asia.24, 25, 26 The 5\u2010year survival rate remains poor, even with great developments in treatment strategies such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.27, 28 Targeted therapy such as EGFR\u2010TKI has improved the 5\u2010year survival rate in lung cancer, 19, 29, 30, 31but acquired resistance is a major problem. Recently, the cell cycle inhibitor caught our attention; it had been applied successfully in breast cancer,32 multiple myeloma33 and lung cancer. Researchers are striving to improve their understanding of targeted drugs in cancer for patients with EGFR mutations,34, 35 K\u2010Ras mutations36, 37 and EML4\u2010ALK rearrangements38, 39 to address acquired resistance. Blocking one or two pathways could not inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells because the cell signaling pathway is a network structure. The proliferation of one cell must go through cell cycle regulation, so the cell cycle inhibitor may be the promising drug that can be used in the treatment of cancer,40 and our laboratory had identified it in lung cancer. However, the problem we faced to determine the appropriate time to use cell cycle inhibitors.\n      In previous research, the increased expression of CCND1 and phosphorylated Rb or decreased expression of p16 was thought to be associated with response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer. However, the clinical trial PALOMA\u20101 identified that they had no association with PD 0332991.41, 42 While Roger PP's group supposed the phosphorylated CDK4 could potentially predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 blockade,43 this was not confirmed later in clinical results.44 Wang et\u00a0al (2017) examined whether the expression of cyclin D3 and CDK6 is associated with palbociclib or ribociclib treatment through depletion of the antioxidants NADPH and glutathione.45 Based on the results of experiments demonstrated in this paper, we believe that lncRNA HOTAIR could be a marker of dysregulation of the cell cycle in lung cancer.\n      In the present paper, we found that lncRNA HOTAIR played a pivotal role in the lung cancer cell cycle regulation associated with tumorigenesis and progression. The clinical analysis showed almost all lung primary tumor samples had lncRNA HOATIR expression. KEGG pathway analysis showed that HOTAIR is associated with the cell cycle pathway and is positively correlated with E2F1, CDK4 and CDK6. It could be a marker of cell cycle dysregulation and could be developed as a diagnostic marker. HOTAIR and its 2 segments, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032, also have a negative correlation with the degree of pathological differentiation and a positive correlation with metastasis. In vitro experiment showed that HOTAIR and its 2 segments promote the cell cycle passing through the restriction point during G1 phase by regulating the Rb\u2010E2F pathway, and regulate NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through EMT and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. In the comparison of HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR 5\u2032, the impact of HOTAIR5' in proliferation is stronger than that of HOTAIR3\u2032. In migration and invasion, HOTAIR3\u2032 may be stronger than HOTAIR5\u2032. In cell cycle regulation, the 2 segments of HOTAIR appear to have equal impact. In vivo study showed that HOTAIR promotes tumor growth in an orthotopic NSCLC model. HOTAIR3\u2032 may play a more pivotal role in the promotion of NSCLC progression. The Lenti\u2010HOTAIRsi model showed the slowest tumor\u2010volume growth, concurring with the in\u00a0vivo results. This indicates \\ that HOTAIR could be developed as a targeted therapy, as an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR\u2010TKI). HOTAIR, HOTAIR3\u2032 and HOTAIR5\u2032 promote NSCLC proliferation, migration and invasion, in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. When knockdown reduces HOTAIR expression, we see decreased NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, we found the expression level of HOTAIR is nagetive related to the time patients used EGFR\u2010TKI get acquired resistance in 4 lung adenocarcinama cancer patients in our department. However, due to the limited number of patient samples, it is difficult at this time to determine whether HOTAIR expression is correlated with the time of EGFR\u2010TKI resistance. Therefore, we believe HOTAIR may be not only an ideal indicator of dysregulation of the cell cycle but also a cell cycle inhibitor target in the future.\n      HOTAIR, a noncoding RNA coded by the HOXC gene located between the chromosome 11 and 12 gene cluster, has been well studied.46 Through previous research, it has been identified as a \u201cbridge\u201d to modify 2 histones. The 5\u2032 domain of HOTAIR binds polycomb\u2010repressive complex 2 (PRC2)(EZH2, SUZ12 and EED), the 3\u2032 domains bind the LSD1/CoREST/REST complex, and the 2 complexes, coupled with histone H3 lysine 27 methylation and lysine 4 demethylation, modify target genes.47 It has been found to have increased expression in cervical cancer tissue and is associated with lymph node invasion, lymphatic metastasis and advanced pathological stage. In diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma, HOTAIR expression is strongly associated with poor prognosis.48 High expression of HOTAIR is also related to the T phase, pathological grade and lymphatic metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In breast cancer, high expression of HOTAIR promotes carcinogenesis and cancer progression.49 We believe that lncRNA HOTAIR5\u2032 domain binds polycomb\u2010repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and the 3\u2032 domains binds the LSD1. The complexes affect the CDK4/6\u2010cyclin D and phosphorylates retinoblastoma (Rb), causing transcription of E2F, then activation of EMT and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. The activation of the cell cycle\u2010associated pathway promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration (Figure\u00a09).\n      \n        Figure 9\n        \n          The mechanism of lncRNA HOTAIR promotes non\u2013small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, invasion and migration through cell cycle regulation\n        \n        \n      \n      In conclusion, we have shown that HOTAIR is an obvious indicator of cell cycle dysregulation and could promote NSCLC cell line proliferation, metastasis and invasion through restraining the cell cycle from G1 to S phase, and then affect EMT and the \u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. This leads us to the assumption that lncRNA HOTAIR may be developed for using cell cycle inhibitor to treat lung cancer patients with EGFR\u2010TKI acquired resistance, or directly inhibit HOTAIR as it has been used in glioma research.10, 50 Although we only found 1 lung cancer patient got EGFR\u2010TKI acquired resistance only 5 months, which tissue had both high expression of HOTAIR, Rb and P\u2010Rb, but it is very meaningful. Although we did not find that knockdown of HOTAIR could decrease tumor volume, I think the reason is that transfection efficiency was not very high due to limitations in the available technology. If the relevant equipment is improved, we may see the result we expected. HOTAIR also could be used in the diagnosis of lung cancer, and, therefore, has exciting potential applications.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nSupporting information\n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.",
