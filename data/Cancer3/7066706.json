    "description": "Implications for Practice\n          Although growing evidence supports the safety and efficacy of exercise in lung cancer, both after surgery and during and after medical treatments, most patients are insufficiently active or sedentary. Engaging in exercise programs is particularly arduous for patients with lung cancer, mainly because of a series of physical and psychosocial disease\u2010related barriers (including the smoking stigma). A continuous collaboration among oncologists and cancer exercise specialists is urgently needed in order to develop tailored programs based on patients\u2019 needs, preferences, and physical and psychological status. In this regard, benefit of exercise appears to be potentially enhanced when administered as a multidimensional, comprehensive approach to patients\u2019 well\u2010being.\nIntroduction\n      Historically, patients with cancer were advised to rest, recover, and save energy, avoiding engaging in tiring physical activity. Nevertheless, starting in the late 1980s 1, new data progressively emerged, supporting the notion that physical activity (PA; defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure) and exercise (EX; including only those planned, structured, and repetitive activities aimed at improving or maintaining one or more components of physical fitness) may provide relevant benefits in oncology. In cancer survivors, an inverse correlation between PA and mortality or recurrence rate was reported 2, 3, 4. Moreover, EX can play a beneficial role during and after oncological treatments, leading to clinically meaningful improvements in physical fitness (aerobic, strength, flexibility, and body composition) 5, 6, 7, quality of life (QoL) 8, treatment\u2010related side effects 5, 9, and psychological outcomes (such as anxiety, depression, self\u2010esteem, and energy level and vitality) 5. Nevertheless, the American College of Sport Medicine guidelines for EX in cancer are mainly directed to patients with breast, prostate, colon, gynecologic, and hematological cancer, and no universal recommendations are available for lung cancer.\n      Lung malignancies are the leading cause of cancer\u2010related death 10. Non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are the main histological subtypes of lung cancer, and NSCLC accounts for around 85% of all cases. Despite meaningful recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances, the overall prognosis remains poor for affected patients. In terms of overall survival (OS) according to stage, the eighth edition of TNM classification for lung cancer showed an OS by clinical stage at 24 and 60 months ranging from 97% and 92% for patients at stage I to 10% and 0% for patients at stage IVB 11. Despite crucial progress obtained in terms of availability of innovative treatments (such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy), lung cancer remains associated with physical, psychological, and social difficulties, which exert a negative influence on patients\u2019 QoL. Moreover, various cancer\u2010 and treatment\u2010related complications, such as dyspnea, muscle wasting, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and deterioration of physical fitness and lung function, may further impair patients\u2019 status 12. All these outcomes have been suggested to be potentially ameliorable with EX, despite the lack of dedicated guidelines for lung cancer. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the link between cancer and EX. The main hypothesis and evidence include the control of chronic low\u2010grade inflammation and the modulation of metabolic dysregulation substances (e.g., insulin, glucose, and insulin\u2010like growth factors) and sex hormones. Moreover, it seems that PA and EX could have an impact on oxidative stress and immune\u2010related function, modifying some crucial mechanisms connected to tumor microenvironment (e.g., angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis) 13.\n      In this article, we perform an in\u2010depth revision of available data investigating the role of PA and EX in patients with lung cancer undergoing surgical and/or medical treatments. Moreover, we analyze potential underlying biological mechanisms, peculiar to lung cancer oncogenesis, and suggest a structured, multidimensional way forward to definitively address the potential impact of PA and EX on lung cancer outcomes.\nMaterials and Methods\n      A comprehensive Pubmed and http://clinicaltrials.gov search was performed on July 24, 2019, to identify the published and ongoing studies exploring the role of PA and EX in lung cancer. The following keywords were used: exercise, physical activity, lung cancer, non\u2010small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer. In order to acquire a complete and in\u2010depth perspective on this emerging topic, all original articles (randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and observational data) investigating PA and EX in lung cancer were considered. Abstracts not published in extenso, case reports, non\u2010English full texts, and theses were excluded. Participants\u2019 inclusion criteria were adults affected by lung cancer, surgically treated, during or after medical therapies; animal studies were also considered. Regarding intervention, we considered physical activity (including also exercise by definition), defined as supervised or unsupervised interventions including any type of exercise applied to patients with lung cancer and performed for at least 4\u2009weeks. All inclusion criteria were evaluated, in title, abstract, and full text of original papers, by two independent reviewers.\nInvestigated Outcomes in Lung Cancer\n      A series of studies have investigated the impact of PA and EX on measurable outcomes such as cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, strength and muscle mass, fatigue, quality of life, psychological status, and sleep quality (Table 1 and Fig. 1).\n      \n        Table 1\n        \n          Main interventional studies after surgery and/or during medical treatments in lung cancer\n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              Author\n              Patients and study type\n              Duration and type of intervention\n              Primary outcomes\n              Secondary outcomes\n              Main results\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Peddle\u2010Mclntyre et al. 54\n\n              \n14 NSCLC\n(I\u2013IIIB)\nSingle arm\n\n              12 wks of a distance\u2010based intervention with printed materials +12 wks follow\u2010up\n              Feasibility\n              Physical activity level, QoL\n              \n\u2193 eligibility and attrition rate\n\u2191 physical activity level\n\u2191 QoL (some domains)\n\u2191 pain\nShort\u2010term benefits\n\n            \n            \n              Sommer et al. 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64\n\n              \n40 NSCLC\n(I\u2013IIIA)\nRCT\n\n              2 wks of preoperative +12 wks of postoperative aerobic and strength activity + multidisciplinary intervention\n              Safety, feasibility, and QoL\n              Anxiety, depression, distress, perceived social support, smoking, alcohol, and physical activity habits;

In lung cancer, about 90% 15 of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 57% 16 of surgically resected patients experience this side effect. Different genetic and behavioral risk factors can predispose patients to cancer\u2010related fatigue 17, which has numerous manifestations, such as weakness, sleep disturbance, and lower concentration or attention, that cause a negative impact on work, mood, and social relationships, decreasing QoL 17. Several candidate factors have been suggested as underlying mechanisms inducing cancer\u2010related fatigue. Among them, an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (such as c\u2010reactive protein, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1) and angiogenic modulators (mainly vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), anemia, disturbance in the hypothalamic\u2010pituitary adrenal axis, altered brain serotonin metabolism, and defect in adenosine triphosphate regeneration seem to play a crucial role 18, 19.\n        By modulating these biological mechanisms, EX may improve the management of cancer\u2010related fatigue by reducing symptoms\u2019 severity. Indeed, EX has been demonstrated to assist fatigue management in patients with cancer and cancer survivors affected by different types of malignancies (such as breast, colon, prostate, etc.) 8. Moreover, a recent meta\u2010analysis has found that EX and psychological intervention are more effective than a pharmacological approach to counteract such distress 20. Observational studies in lung cancer reported an inverse correlation between PA and symptoms of fatigue 21, 22, 23. In particular, D'Silva et al. objectively assessed PA and sedentary time in 127 patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IV) and found that moderate\u2010 to vigorous\u2010intensity activity was associated with fewer fatigue symptoms, whereas sedentary time was associated with increased fatigue, negatively affecting QoL and physical and functional well\u2010being 21. Moreover, Janssen et al. described a routine rehabilitation program, offered to patients with lung cancer, composed of aerobic and strength exercises with a frequency of three times per week. Fifty patients (stage I\u2013IIIA) started the program with a completion rate of 86%. After 12\u2009weeks, fatigue, QoL, and cardiorespiratory fitness were significantly improved from the baseline assessment 22. Similarly, other interventional studies showed that EX ameliorates fatigue\u2010related symptoms 24, 25, 26, 27, especially if initiated early after surgery 28. For instance, a randomized controlled trial including 96 patients with lung cancer (including NSCLC stage I\u2013IV and SCLC) undergoing chemotherapy compared the effect of a tai chi program (performed every other day) versus low impact exercise (as a control group) on cancer\u2010related fatigue. The tai chi group reported an improvement in total fatigue score compared with the control group at 6\u2009weeks (59.6 \u00b1\u200911.3 vs. 66.8 \u00b1\u200911.9, p < .05) and 12\u2009weeks (53.3 \u00b1\u200911.8 vs. 59.3 \u00b1\u200912.2, p < .05) 24. Although these findings seem to support the benefit of EX for cancer\u2010related fatigue in lung cancer, other interventional studies reported no changes in fatigue levels after a targeted exercise program 29, 30, 31, 32. In this regard, a trial randomized 112 patients with lung cancer (NSCLC stage III\u2013IV and SCLC) to 8\u2010week supervised and unsupervised PA sessions plus a behavioral support program, and general health education materials or control (general health education material only). After the intervention, at 4 and 6 months, no significant changes were detected in terms of fatigue, QoL, symptom severity, physical or functional status, and survival between the two groups 29. Nevertheless, the engagement in an EX program was never associated with an exacerbation in fatigue levels. Further studies are required to consolidate the real contribution of exercise on cancer\u2010related fatigue in lung cancer.\n      \n      \n        Quality of Life\n        QoL is defined by a subjective and multidimensional concept that includes physical, psychological, and social domains and has shown a prognostic impact in lung cancer 33, 34. The World Health Organization describes QoL as \u201can individual's perception of their position in life, in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and relation to their goals, expectations, standard and concerns\u201d 35. Patients with lung cancer have a long\u2010lasting QoL impairment compared with healthy people, especially regarding physical health score, after both surgery and chemotherapy or radiotherapy 36, 37, 38. Nevertheless, the level of QoL reduction might also depend on disease stage, prognosis, and tumor localization 39. A longitudinal study among 107 patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013IV) showed a direct correlation between QoL level and time dedicated in walking activities over a 6\u2010month follow\u2010up period, with a QoL increase by 0.03 points per additional minute of walking time per week 40. A comprehensive systematic review including 16 randomized controlled trials with different cancer types (breast, colorectal, lymphoma, prostate, and lung) concluded that EX significantly improved QoL (mean difference, 5.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16\u20137.90; p < .001), during and after medical treatment. Moreover, during treatment, a gain in both psychological and physical variables was observed, whereas after completion of therapies an improvement in only the physical aspects was evident 41.\n        Focusing on studies including only patients with lung cancer, no clear advantage in terms of QoL after applying a physical exercise program is evident 29, 31, 32, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. A randomized controlled trial attempted to assess the impact of EX intervention on QoL in 81 patients undergoing thoracotomy. Although the study closed prematurely (after 57 patients randomized) because of the introduction of video\u2010assisted thoracoscopic surgery, after 12\u2009weeks of intervention and during follow\u2010up, a very high drop\u2010out rate was reported (8/23 patients in the active group and 11/25 in the control group performed the functional test), with no changes in QoL and increased pain in the active group 50. On the other hand, there are studies reporting a QoL improvement after training 25, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55. Among them, a study with 40 patients with stage I\u2013IIIA NSCLC showed a significant improvement in global quality of life (p = .0032), emotional well\u2010being (p < .0001), mental health component (p = .0004), and a reduction in anxiety, depression, and distress after 12\u2009weeks of multidisciplinary intervention including PA (aerobic, strength, and nature activity), dietary guidance, social counseling, and other options (e.g., counseling for smoking cessation) 51. Considering the controversial association between exercise and QoL in lung cancer care, further studies with a solid design and an adequate sample size are required to clarify this issue.\n      \n      \n        Pulmonary Function\n        The assessment of respiratory functionality by a global spirometry test is a crucial step to define therapeutic perspectives in lung cancer. In particular, the predicted postoperative of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) are the most utilized parameters to evaluate the surgical risk 56 and are associated with the prognosis of patients with lung cancer 57, 58. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and comorbidities (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) may be harmful for the pulmonary system, reducing respiratory functionality 59, 60, 61. Historically, the respiratory system is defined as overbuilt for exercise, and therefore training does not appear to confer a significant adaptation in lung of healthy human subjects 62. Nevertheless, the role of EX is still controversial in pulmonary diseases. EX in patients with COPD is largely studied, and a recent meta\u2010analysis including 21 randomized controlled trials has analyzed the role of whole\u2010body exercise on pulmonary function in adult participants with chronic lung diseases (mainly COPD). The results demonstrated a small but significant improvement in spirometry values in the EX group as compared with controls, suggesting that in certain conditions the respiratory system may adapt in response to training 63.\n        In lung cancer, the effect of EX on pulmonary parameters was investigated with preliminary supportive evidence 43, 64, 65, 66, 67. An individual supervised training (three times per week, 60 minutes per session) was proposed in 17 patients with stage I\u2013IIIA NSCLC. After 8\u2009weeks of training, an increase was observed in exercise capacity (the primary outcome), without any significant improvement in other parameters, such as strength, QoL, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and pulmonary function 43. However, in the first year after surgery, patients usually experience an increase in pulmonary parameters 68 that may be attributed to compensatory mechanisms, such as the expansion of the remaining lobes and vascular tissues 69. In this postoperative context, studies testing different training programs are consistent in detecting an improvement in respiratory muscle strength and/or functionality 42, 52, 70. A retrospective study evaluated the outcome of a comprehensive rehabilitation schedule on pulmonary function in 82 patients with lung cancer (stage IIB\u2013IV). The program included relaxation (at least once per day), respiratory training (at least once day before surgery), cough training (at least once per day before surgery), activities of daily living (after surgery) and lower\u2010extremity exercise (high\u2010intensity aerobic exercise, 5\u2009days per week for 45 minutes). At 8\u201310\u2009weeks, significant increases in forced vital capacity (FVC; +6.4%, p = .0096) and in FEV1 (+\u200910.4%, p < .0001) were found, whereas the DLCO decreased. Even in current or former smokers, an improvement in FEV1 was observed, whereas patients with respiratory impairment experienced a greater increase in both FVC (+13.9%, p = .0025) and FEV1 (+\u200922.5%, p < .0001) 71. Collectively, these results should be interpreted cautiously, because some studies lack a control group and several aspects need to be further defined, mainly about the potential role of EX on postsurgery compensatory mechanisms.\n      \n      \n        Cardiorespiratory Fitness\n        Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and the 6\u2010minute walking test (6MWT) are the most applied assessments for cardiorespiratory fitness in lung cancer. Cardiorespiratory fitness reflects the capability to introduce, transport, and use oxygen, and it is an important index of functionality, health, and longevity. Similar to pulmonary function, VO2peak can provide clinically relevant diagnostic and prognostic information. It is inversely related to perioperative and postoperative complications, and it is an independent predictor of survival 72. To date, three studies have investigated the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and survival in lung cancer 73, 74, 75. In this regard, Jones et al. prospectively found that each 50 meters of improvement in 6MWT was associated with a reduction of 13% in risk of death in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Furthermore, compared with patients in the lowest 6MWT group, the overall reduction of death risk improved together with the increase in functional capacity (from 39% to 52%) 75. Cardiorespiratory fitness was compromised in patients with lung cancer versus healthy participants (mean difference, 0.87 mL \u00d7 kg\u22121 \u00d7 min\u22121; 95% CI, \u221212.1 to \u22125.3; p < .001) 76, and this impairment did not improve after therapies. Fifty patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IIIB) were monitored for 6 months, from diagnosis (pretreatment) to the following 10\u2009weeks (during treatment) and 6 months (usually after completion of therapies). 6MWT declined significantly from diagnosis to during treatment (\u221242.7 m; 95% CI, \u221271.4 to 14.0; p < .01) and continued to be lower after 6 months (\u221277.9 m; 95% CI, \u2212144.3 to 11.4; p = .02) 77.\n        Cardiorespiratory fitness involves several consecutive steps, including respiratory and cardiovascular systems, vasculature, blood, and skeletal muscle. In healthy persons the most important factor that limits exercise capacity is the cardiac muscle 62, but in lung malignancies many cancer\u2010related factors concur to diminishing the cardiorespiratory fitness 78. First, the presence of a tumor mass, together with related surgical procedures, may affect the respiratory system by reducing diffusion capacity. Second, in case of advanced disease, the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscles is impaired with a reduction in capillarization and mitochondrial density. Moreover, chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may harm cardiac pump, blood cell populations, and vascular function 78.\n        Although in lung diseases the respiratory system could play a major role in limiting exercise capacity, in long\u2010term postpneumonectomy patients (mean 5.5\u2009years after surgery), it was suggested that it was mainly limited by the cardiovascular system 79. Nevertheless, physical exercise may mitigate these impairments and improve the cardiorespiratory fitness in lung cancer. A randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of high\u2010intensity endurance and strength training on cardiorespiratory fitness as primary outcome. Sixty\u2010one patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IV) were enrolled in an exercise program (60 minutes for three times per week). After 20\u2009weeks, with an adherence rate of 88%, the authors found an increase of 4.5 \u00b1\u20093.4 mL \u00d7 kg\u22121 \u00d7 min\u22121 in the EX group, whereas the control group reported a decrease of \u20130.6 \u00b1\u20092.7 mL \u00d7 kg\u22121 \u00d7 min\u22121 in cardiorespiratory fitness 52. Similarly, a recent study including patients with surgically resected NSCLC (stage I\u2013II) detected a significant VO2peak increment in the EX group versus control 42. Globally considered, although some studies did not report any significant change in functional capacity following a training period 27, 29, 45, 47, 48, 49, 55, 64, 65, the majority agreed on the potential beneficial effect of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness 22, 25, 31, 42, 43, 44, 46, 50, 52, 53, 66, 67, 70, 80.\n      \n      \n        Strength and Muscle Mass\n        Strength and muscle composition (muscle mass or size) are the most accurate parameters to evaluate muscle function. Patients with lung cancer may suffer from muscle dysfunction for disease\u2010related metabolic disorders, oncological treatments, physical inactivity, and malnutrition 81. Muscle mass alterations occurring during cancer define pathological conditions, such as cachexia (a multifactorial syndrome characterized by severe muscle wasting, malnutrition, and systemic inflammation) and sarcopenia (decreased muscle mass). The majority of patients affected by advanced lung cancer experience cachexia (69%) or sarcopenia (47%) 82, both related to a poor prognosis 12, 81, 83. Considering that strength is closely linked to muscle mass, patients with lung cancer may also have relevant impairments of this parameter. Indeed, patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IIIA) had a significantly lower handgrip strength as compared with healthy controls, with a mean difference of \u22126 kg (p = .023) 76. Muscular strength is an important parameter, and, in healthy persons, it represents a predictor of all\u2010cause mortality 84. A study investigating the impact of strength on survival found that handgrip strength is an independent prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC and gastrointestinal cancer with advanced and metastatic disease 85.\n        EX, especially resistance training, is a potent modulator of skeletal muscle and could counteract muscle dysfunction in patients with lung cancer. The majority of interventional studies that included strength assessment in their secondary outcomes found a positive effect of EX 31, 44, 47, 48, 52, 53, 64, 66, 80, whereas few of them reported no relevant effect 43, 46, 55. However, relatively few studies explored the role of EX on muscle mass in lung cancer. Salhi et al. investigated the impact of a rehabilitation program on muscle mass and strength in 45 patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013III) who underwent radical oncological treatments (surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The rehabilitation consisted of an initial warming\u2010up (20 minutes), followed by resistance training of upper and lower limb muscles with conventional resistance training or whole\u2010body vibration training, 3\u2009days per week for 12\u2009weeks after treatment completion. A significant decrease in muscle cross\u2010sectional area and in quadriceps force with a conservation in fat\u2010free mass, measured with bioelectrical impedance, was observed after treatments. Following a 12\u2010week rehabilitation program, full recovery in muscle strength and mass was detected in the intervention arm, whereas the control group experienced a further decline from baseline 86.\n        As suggested in the context of preclinical studies, aerobic and strength training seem to induce a relevant benefit against cancer cachexia 87, 88. To our knowledge, only one study is available in patients with cachexia. The MENAC trial tests a multimodal intervention to attenuate and/or prevent cancer cachexia, which included anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, oral nutritional supplements, nutritional counseling, and an exercise program, on patients with lung and pancreatic cancer. To assess intervention safety and feasibility, a phase II cohort randomized 46 patients (26 with advanced NSCLC). The home\u2010based EX intervention consisted of aerobic training (30 minutes two times per week) and six individualized strength tasks (three times per week). Six weeks later, the intervention was shown to be safe and feasible, with a compliance of 76% for anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, 60% for exercise, and 48% for nutritional supplements. No significant changes in PA, muscle mass and strength, fatigue, and nutritional status were reported, probably because of the small sample size 89. The phase III cohort of MENAC trial, which will include 240 patients, is currently enrolling patients (NCT02330926) to clarify the efficacy of this multimodal intervention.\n      \n      \n        Psychological Status and Sleep Quality\n        Patients with lung cancer may experience several health problems, including psychological distress, because of cancer or undesired effects of its treatment. PA and EX may contribute to limiting these impairments.\n        The beneficial role of PA and EX in anxiety and depression is well established 90, 91 through the modulation of monoamine and cortisol levels, leading to adaptation in limbic structures 92. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders among patients with lung cancer is 33%, 34%, and 45%\u201357%, respectively 93, 94. In the context of lung cancer, few studies have considered the potential role of EX to improve these symptoms, finding positive 44, 51 or neutral effects 31. Chen et al. investigated the impact of EX on anxiety and depression symptoms as a primary outcome in a sample of patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013IV). Enrolled participants (n =\u2009116) were randomly assigned to a 12\u2010week moderate\u2010intensity walking program, three times per week for 40 minutes, or usual care. After the intervention, anxiety (p = .009) and depression (p = .00006) levels were significantly diminished, and the effect was maintained over time (anxiety, p = .006; depression, p = .004) 30.\n        EX can improve sleep quality in the general population 95, but also in cancer survivors 96. Sleep disturbances are a common problem in oncology care and affect a large portion of patients with lung cancer, especially during the chemotherapy period 94. EX seems to contribute to improving sleep quality in patients with lung cancer 23, 32, 96, although results of different studies are controversial 29, 30. A home\u2010based walking program proposed by Chen et al. has shown that 12\u2009weeks of moderate\u2010intensity EX is effective over time in improving both subjective (p = .001) and objective (p = .023) sleep quality in a sample of patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013IV) compared with the control group 96.\nFatigue\n        Cancer\u2010related fatigue is defined as \u201ca distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer and/or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning\u201d 14. In lung cancer, about 90% 15 of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 57% 16 of surgically resected patients experience this side effect. Different genetic and behavioral risk factors can predispose patients to cancer\u2010related fatigue 17, which has numerous manifestations, such as weakness, sleep disturbance, and lower concentration or attention, that cause a negative impact on work, mood, and social relationships, decreasing QoL 17. Several candidate factors have been suggested as underlying mechanisms inducing cancer\u2010related fatigue. Among them, an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (such as c\u2010reactive protein, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1) and angiogenic modulators (mainly vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), anemia, disturbance in the hypothalamic\u2010pituitary adrenal axis, altered brain serotonin metabolism, and defect in adenosine triphosphate regeneration seem to play a crucial role 18, 19.\n        By modulating these biological mechanisms, EX may improve the management of cancer\u2010related fatigue by reducing symptoms\u2019 severity. Indeed, EX has been demonstrated to assist fatigue management in patients with cancer and cancer survivors affected by different types of malignancies (such as breast, colon, prostate, etc.) 8. Moreover, a recent meta\u2010analysis has found that EX and psychological intervention are more effective than a pharmacological approach to counteract such distress 20. Observational studies in lung cancer reported an inverse correlation between PA and symptoms of fatigue 21, 22, 23. In particular, D'Silva et al. objectively assessed PA and sedentary time in 127 patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IV) and found that moderate\u2010 to vigorous\u2010intensity activity was associated with fewer fatigue symptoms, whereas sedentary time was associated with increased fatigue, negatively affecting QoL and physical and functional well\u2010being 21. Moreover, Janssen et al. described a routine rehabilitation program, offered to patients with lung cancer, composed of aerobic and strength exercises with a frequency of three times per week. Fifty patients (stage I\u2013IIIA) started the program with a completion rate of 86%. After 12\u2009weeks, fatigue, QoL, and cardiorespiratory fitness were significantly improved from the baseline assessment 22. Similarly, other interventional studies showed that EX ameliorates fatigue\u2010related symptoms 24, 25, 26, 27, especially if initiated early after surgery 28. For instance, a randomized controlled trial including 96 patients with lung cancer (including NSCLC stage I\u2013IV and SCLC) undergoing chemotherapy compared the effect of a tai chi program (performed every other day) versus low impact exercise (as a control group) on cancer\u2010related fatigue. The tai chi group reported an improvement in total fatigue score compared with the control group at 6\u2009weeks (59.6 \u00b1\u200911.3 vs. 66.8 \u00b1\u200911.9, p < .05) and 12\u2009weeks (53.3 \u00b1\u200911.8 vs. 59.3 \u00b1\u200912.2, p < .05) 24. Although these findings seem to support the benefit of EX for cancer\u2010related fatigue in lung cancer, other interventional studies reported no changes in fatigue levels after a targeted exercise program 29, 30, 31, 32. In this regard, a trial randomized 112 patients with lung cancer (NSCLC stage III\u2013IV and SCLC) to 8\u2010week supervised and unsupervised PA sessions plus a behavioral support program, and general health education materials or control (general health education material only). After the intervention, at 4 and 6 months, no significant changes were detected in terms of fatigue, QoL, symptom severity, physical or functional status, and survival between the two groups 29. Nevertheless, the engagement in an EX program was never associated with an exacerbation in fatigue levels. Further studies are required to consolidate the real contribution of exercise on cancer\u2010related fatigue in lung cancer.\nQuality of Life\n        QoL is defined by a subjective and multidimensional concept that includes physical, psychological, and social domains and has shown a prognostic impact in lung cancer 33, 34. The World Health Organization describes QoL as \u201can individual's perception of their position in life, in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and relation to their goals, expectations, standard and concerns\u201d 35. Patients with lung cancer have a long\u2010lasting QoL impairment compared with healthy people, especially regarding physical health score, after both surgery and chemotherapy or radiotherapy 36, 37, 38. Nevertheless, the level of QoL reduction might also depend on disease stage, prognosis, and tumor localization 39. A longitudinal study among 107 patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013IV) showed a direct correlation between QoL level and time dedicated in walking activities over a 6\u2010month follow\u2010up period, with a QoL increase by 0.03 points per additional minute of walking time per week 40. A comprehensive systematic review including 16 randomized controlled trials with different cancer types (breast, colorectal, lymphoma, prostate, and lung) concluded that EX significantly improved QoL (mean difference, 5.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16\u20137.90; p < .001), during and after medical treatment. Moreover, during treatment, a gain in both psychological and physical variables was observed, whereas after completion of therapies an improvement in only the physical aspects was evident 41.\n        Focusing on studies including only patients with lung cancer, no clear advantage in terms of QoL after applying a physical exercise program is evident 29, 31, 32, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. A randomized controlled trial attempted to assess the impact of EX intervention on QoL in 81 patients undergoing thoracotomy. Although the study closed prematurely (after 57 patients randomized) because of the introduction of video\u2010assisted thoracoscopic surgery, after 12\u2009weeks of intervention and during follow\u2010up, a very high drop\u2010out rate was reported (8/23 patients in the active group and 11/25 in the control group performed the functional test), with no changes in QoL and increased pain in the active group 50. On the other hand, there are studies reporting a QoL improvement after training 25, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55. Among them, a study with 40 patients with stage I\u2013IIIA NSCLC showed a significant improvement in global quality of life (p = .0032), emotional well\u2010being (p < .0001), mental health component (p = .0004), and a reduction in anxiety, depression, and distress after 12\u2009weeks of multidisciplinary intervention including PA (aerobic, strength, and nature activity), dietary guidance, social counseling, and other options (e.g., counseling for smoking cessation) 51. Considering the controversial association between exercise and QoL in lung cancer care, further studies with a solid design and an adequate sample size are required to clarify this issue.\nPulmonary Function\n        The assessment of respiratory functionality by a global spirometry test is a crucial step to define therapeutic perspectives in lung cancer. In particular, the predicted postoperative of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) are the most utilized parameters to evaluate the surgical risk 56 and are associated with the prognosis of patients with lung cancer 57, 58. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and comorbidities (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) may be harmful for the pulmonary system, reducing respiratory functionality 59, 60, 61. Historically, the respiratory system is defined as overbuilt for exercise, and therefore training does not appear to confer a significant adaptation in lung of healthy human subjects 62. Nevertheless, the role of EX is still controversial in pulmonary diseases. EX in patients with COPD is largely studied, and a recent meta\u2010analysis including 21 randomized controlled trials has analyzed the role of whole\u2010body exercise on pulmonary function in adult participants with chronic lung diseases (mainly COPD). The results demonstrated a small but significant improvement in spirometry values in the EX group as compared with controls, suggesting that in certain conditions the respiratory system may adapt in response to training 63.\n        In lung cancer, the effect of EX on pulmonary parameters was investigated with preliminary supportive evidence 43, 64, 65, 66, 67. An individual supervised training (three times per week, 60 minutes per session) was proposed in 17 patients with stage I\u2013IIIA NSCLC. After 8\u2009weeks of training, an increase was observed in exercise capacity (the primary outcome), without any significant improvement in other parameters, such as strength, QoL, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and pulmonary function 43. However, in the first year after surgery, patients usually experience an increase in pulmonary parameters 68 that may be attributed to compensatory mechanisms, such as the expansion of the remaining lobes and vascular tissues 69. In this postoperative context, studies testing different training programs are consistent in detecting an improvement in respiratory muscle strength and/or functionality 42, 52, 70. A retrospective study evaluated the outcome of a comprehensive rehabilitation schedule on pulmonary function in 82 patients with lung cancer (stage IIB\u2013IV). The program included relaxation (at least once per day), respiratory training (at least once day before surgery), cough training (at least once per day before surgery), activities of daily living (after surgery) and lower\u2010extremity exercise (high\u2010intensity aerobic exercise, 5\u2009days per week for 45 minutes). At 8\u201310\u2009weeks, significant increases in forced vital capacity (FVC; +6.4%, p = .0096) and in FEV1 (+\u200910.4%, p < .0001) were found, whereas the DLCO decreased. Even in current or former smokers, an improvement in FEV1 was observed, whereas patients with respiratory impairment experienced a greater increase in both FVC (+13.9%, p = .0025) and FEV1 (+\u200922.5%, p < .0001) 71. Collectively, these results should be interpreted cautiously, because some studies lack a control group and several aspects need to be further defined, mainly about the potential role of EX on postsurgery compensatory mechanisms.\nCardiorespiratory Fitness\n        Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and the 6\u2010minute walking test (6MWT) are the most applied assessments for cardiorespiratory fitness in lung cancer. Cardiorespiratory fitness reflects the capability to introduce, transport, and use oxygen, and it is an important index of functionality, health, and longevity. Similar to pulmonary function, VO2peak can provide clinically relevant diagnostic and prognostic information. It is inversely related to perioperative and postoperative complications, and it is an independent predictor of survival 72. To date, three studies have investigated the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and survival in lung cancer 73, 74, 75. In this regard, Jones et al. prospectively found that each 50 meters of improvement in 6MWT was associated with a reduction of 13% in risk of death in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Furthermore, compared with patients in the lowest 6MWT group, the overall reduction of death risk improved together with the increase in functional capacity (from 39% to 52%) 75. Cardiorespiratory fitness was compromised in patients with lung cancer versus healthy participants (mean difference, 0.87 mL \u00d7 kg\u22121 \u00d7 min\u22121; 95% CI, \u221212.1 to \u22125.3; p < .001) 76, and this impairment did not improve after therapies. Fifty patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IIIB) were monitored for 6 months, from diagnosis (pretreatment) to the following 10\u2009weeks (during treatment) and 6 months (usually after completion of therapies). 6MWT declined significantly from diagnosis to during treatment (\u221242.7 m; 95% CI, \u221271.4 to 14.0; p < .01) and continued to be lower after 6 months (\u221277.9 m; 95% CI, \u2212144.3 to 11.4; p = .02) 77.\n        Cardiorespiratory fitness involves several consecutive steps, including respiratory and cardiovascular systems, vasculature, blood, and skeletal muscle. In healthy persons the most important factor that limits exercise capacity is the cardiac muscle 62, but in lung malignancies many cancer\u2010related factors concur to diminishing the cardiorespiratory fitness 78. First, the presence of a tumor mass, together with related surgical procedures, may affect the respiratory system by reducing diffusion capacity. Second, in case of advanced disease, the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscles is impaired with a reduction in capillarization and mitochondrial density. Moreover, chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may harm cardiac pump, blood cell populations, and vascular function 78.\n        Although in lung diseases the respiratory system could play a major role in limiting exercise capacity, in long\u2010term postpneumonectomy patients (mean 5.5\u2009years after surgery), it was suggested that it was mainly limited by the cardiovascular system 79. Nevertheless, physical exercise may mitigate these impairments and improve the cardiorespiratory fitness in lung cancer. A randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of high\u2010intensity endurance and strength training on cardiorespiratory fitness as primary outcome. Sixty\u2010one patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IV) were enrolled in an exercise program (60 minutes for three times per week). After 20\u2009weeks, with an adherence rate of 88%, the authors found an increase of 4.5 \u00b1\u20093.4 mL \u00d7 kg\u22121 \u00d7 min\u22121 in the EX group, whereas the control group reported a decrease of \u20130.6 \u00b1\u20092.7 mL \u00d7 kg\u22121 \u00d7 min\u22121 in cardiorespiratory fitness 52. Similarly, a recent study including patients with surgically resected NSCLC (stage I\u2013II) detected a significant VO2peak increment in the EX group versus control 42. Globally considered, although some studies did not report any significant change in functional capacity following a training period 27, 29, 45, 47, 48, 49, 55, 64, 65, the majority agreed on the potential beneficial effect of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness 22, 25, 31, 42, 43, 44, 46, 50, 52, 53, 66, 67, 70, 80.\nStrength and Muscle Mass\n        Strength and muscle composition (muscle mass or size) are the most accurate parameters to evaluate muscle function. Patients with lung cancer may suffer from muscle dysfunction for disease\u2010related metabolic disorders, oncological treatments, physical inactivity, and malnutrition 81. Muscle mass alterations occurring during cancer define pathological conditions, such as cachexia (a multifactorial syndrome characterized by severe muscle wasting, malnutrition, and systemic inflammation) and sarcopenia (decreased muscle mass). The majority of patients affected by advanced lung cancer experience cachexia (69%) or sarcopenia (47%) 82, both related to a poor prognosis 12, 81, 83. Considering that strength is closely linked to muscle mass, patients with lung cancer may also have relevant impairments of this parameter. Indeed, patients with NSCLC (stage I\u2013IIIA) had a significantly lower handgrip strength as compared with healthy controls, with a mean difference of \u22126 kg (p = .023) 76. Muscular strength is an important parameter, and, in healthy persons, it represents a predictor of all\u2010cause mortality 84. A study investigating the impact of strength on survival found that handgrip strength is an independent prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC and gastrointestinal cancer with advanced and metastatic disease 85.\n        EX, especially resistance training, is a potent modulator of skeletal muscle and could counteract muscle dysfunction in patients with lung cancer. The majority of interventional studies that included strength assessment in their secondary outcomes found a positive effect of EX 31, 44, 47, 48, 52, 53, 64, 66, 80, whereas few of them reported no relevant effect 43, 46, 55. However, relatively few studies explored the role of EX on muscle mass in lung cancer. Salhi et al. investigated the impact of a rehabilitation program on muscle mass and strength in 45 patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013III) who underwent radical oncological treatments (surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The rehabilitation consisted of an initial warming\u2010up (20 minutes), followed by resistance training of upper and lower limb muscles with conventional resistance training or whole\u2010body vibration training, 3\u2009days per week for 12\u2009weeks after treatment completion. A significant decrease in muscle cross\u2010sectional area and in quadriceps force with a conservation in fat\u2010free mass, measured with bioelectrical impedance, was observed after treatments. Following a 12\u2010week rehabilitation program, full recovery in muscle strength and mass was detected in the intervention arm, whereas the control group experienced a further decline from baseline 86.\n        As suggested in the context of preclinical studies, aerobic and strength training seem to induce a relevant benefit against cancer cachexia 87, 88. To our knowledge, only one study is available in patients with cachexia. The MENAC trial tests a multimodal intervention to attenuate and/or prevent cancer cachexia, which included anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, oral nutritional supplements, nutritional counseling, and an exercise program, on patients with lung and pancreatic cancer. To assess intervention safety and feasibility, a phase II cohort randomized 46 patients (26 with advanced NSCLC). The home\u2010based EX intervention consisted of aerobic training (30 minutes two times per week) and six individualized strength tasks (three times per week). Six weeks later, the intervention was shown to be safe and feasible, with a compliance of 76% for anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, 60% for exercise, and 48% for nutritional supplements. No significant changes in PA, muscle mass and strength, fatigue, and nutritional status were reported, probably because of the small sample size 89. The phase III cohort of MENAC trial, which will include 240 patients, is currently enrolling patients (NCT02330926) to clarify the efficacy of this multimodal intervention.\nPsychological Status and Sleep Quality\n        Patients with lung cancer may experience several health problems, including psychological distress, because of cancer or undesired effects of its treatment. PA and EX may contribute to limiting these impairments.\n        The beneficial role of PA and EX in anxiety and depression is well established 90, 91 through the modulation of monoamine and cortisol levels, leading to adaptation in limbic structures 92. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders among patients with lung cancer is 33%, 34%, and 45%\u201357%, respectively 93, 94. In the context of lung cancer, few studies have considered the potential role of EX to improve these symptoms, finding positive 44, 51 or neutral effects 31. Chen et al. investigated the impact of EX on anxiety and depression symptoms as a primary outcome in a sample of patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013IV). Enrolled participants (n =\u2009116) were randomly assigned to a 12\u2010week moderate\u2010intensity walking program, three times per week for 40 minutes, or usual care. After the intervention, anxiety (p = .009) and depression (p = .00006) levels were significantly diminished, and the effect was maintained over time (anxiety, p = .006; depression, p = .004) 30.\n        EX can improve sleep quality in the general population 95, but also in cancer survivors 96. Sleep disturbances are a common problem in oncology care and affect a large portion of patients with lung cancer, especially during the chemotherapy period 94. EX seems to contribute to improving sleep quality in patients with lung cancer 23, 32, 96, although results of different studies are controversial 29, 30. A home\u2010based walking program proposed by Chen et al. has shown that 12\u2009weeks of moderate\u2010intensity EX is effective over time in improving both subjective (p = .001) and objective (p = .023) sleep quality in a sample of patients with lung cancer (stage I\u2013IV) compared with the control group 96.\nBiological Mechanisms\n      The molecular mechanisms by which PA and EX could influence lung cancer outcomes remain elusive. Data from literature suggest that PA and EX may counteract some specific cancer cells\u2019 acquired capabilities (hallmarks of cancer) and, at the same time, prevent chemotherapy\u2010related adverse events (Fig. 1).\n      The ability to promote an aberrant angiogenesis represents a main hallmark of cancer. In fact, as an adaptive response to hypoxia, cancer cells activate the hypoxia\u2010inducible factor 1\u2010alpha (HIF\u20101\u03b1) pathway to promote angiogenesis through proangiogenetic factors, mainly VEGF\u2010\u03b1 97. Under normal conditions, EX stimulates a physiological angiogenetic process and VEGF release in skeletal muscles in a HIF\u20101\u2013independent manner 98. Nevertheless, how EX modulates angiogenesis in an oncological setting is not clear. Treadmill exercise for a period of 4\u2009weeks, five times per week and 60 minutes each session, has demonstrated to significantly increase VEGF serum levels in mice inoculated with Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells, as compared with baseline (p = .015), but without significant differences in terms of survival rate or tumor growth compared with the control group 99. Alves et al. observed 2.5\u2010fold higher mRNA levels of VEGF\u2010\u03b1 (p < .05) in an LLC mice model undergoing daily high\u2010intensity interval training after tumor cell injection compared with sedentary mice, with a significant reduction of tumor mass (\u221252% after 18\u2009days) and benefit in survival 100.\n      The capability to escape cell death and apoptosis is another hallmark of cancer, and p53 plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor protein 97. EX may affect oncogenesis through activation of p53\u2010induced apoptosis. In this regard, daily wheel running for 4\u2009weeks appeared to reduce primary tumor growth (but not distant metastases), as compared with a control group (p < .01), with a significant increase in p53 intratumoral levels (p < .01), in a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma. Similarly, levels of Bax and caspase 3 (two proapoptotic proteins in the p53 pathway) were significantly increased. Interestingly, this cancer model was p53 wild type, suggesting the potential role of EX in stabilizing p53 and avoiding its downregulation 101.\n      The phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase\u2013AKT pathway (through mTOR and S6 kinase) and the RAS\u2010MAP kinase cascade (through ERK1 and ERK2) are involved in enhancing cell proliferation and survival, as well as in lung cancer cells resistance to chemotherapy and radiation 102, 103. The effect of EX has been studied in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells incubated with human serum, collected pre\u2010 or post\u2010EX, or foetal bovine serum as control. A significant reduction of proliferation and survival for cells treated with post\u2010EX serum compared with control (p < .05 and p < .001, respectively) was observed. A relevant reduction of cell survival was also evident when comparing cells treated with pre\u2010 and post\u2010EX serum (p < .001). To explore the potential underlying reasons, the authors measured activated (phosphorylated) AKT levels through immunoblotting, revealing a significant reduction between cells incubated with pre\u2010 and post\u2010EX serum (p < .001). Similar findings were observed for mTOR, S6 kinase, and ERK1 and ERK2 activation 104.\n      Another possible mechanism underlying the antitumorigenic impact of EX is related to immunomodulation, particularly by increasing proinflammatory cytokine levels and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Pedersen et al. found that EX (wheel running) in LLC mice significantly reduced tumor volume (\u221258%), with an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101a and inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]) and markers for NK and T\u2010cell activity 105. In a prospective randomized study in postsurgical patients with NSCLC, 16\u2009weeks of tai chi chuan training was demonstrated to significantly promote proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as compared with both basal levels (p < .001) and a control group (p < .05), with an increase in their cytotoxicity demonstrated by incubation with lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (p < .001). Moreover, a relevant increase in circulating NK cell percentage, natural killer T, and dendritic CD11c cells between the exercise and control groups was detected 106. In another prospective randomized trial, the control group, including 16 patients with surgically resected NSCLC, experienced a decrease in ratio of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2013producing CD3+ T lymphocytes (T1) to IL\u20104\u2013producing CD3+ T lymphocytes (T2) and an increase in cortisol levels during recovery time. Conversely, the experimental arm (16 postsurgical patients with NSCLC) who followed a guided 16\u2010week moderate\u2010intensity tai chi program (60 minutes per session, three sessions per week) managed to preserve a stable T1\u2010to\u2010T2 ratio and cortisol levels 107. Interestingly, preliminary evidence suggests that chemotherapy\u2010treated patients with lung cancer who joined exercise sessions using resistance bands managed to maintain white blood cell levels during treatment compared with a control group 108.\nConsiderations About Exercise Prescription in Patients with Lung Cancer\n      Mounting evidence suggests that EX is safe in patients with lung cancer, both after surgery and during and after medical treatments. Different programs with a variety of activities were explored, such as tai chi, aerobic and strength exercise, walking, balance, and breathing techniques. The most often applied frequency was two or three times per week, and time per session ranged from 5 to 120 minutes. Across the studies, all the levels of training intensity (light, moderate, and vigorous), when reported, appeared to be well tolerated by patients. However, most patients with lung cancer are insufficiently active or sedentary, and a series of studies reported a low adherence and high drop\u2010out rate from EX programs 43, 48, 65, 109, 110. Among drop\u2010out reasons, cancer\u2010related side effects and, mostly, lack of interest and motivation represent key contributors.\n      There are many barriers limiting the adherence to a PA program. Some of them are also common in healthy people, such as lack of access to services or lack of interest, but others are specifically related to health status, disease course, and therapeutic approach. In addition, environmental and personal exercise preferences, fun, and social implications are important factors that influence the participation and consistency over time to a physical activity program 111. In patients with lung cancer (and their caregivers) there is a higher risk of experiencing exacerbations of psychosocial distress because of the widely shared stigmatization of this disease based on the close link between lung cancer and smoking 112.\n      Several models, applicable also in cancer populations, are applied to trigger motivation to perform exercise (such as social cognitive theory, theory of planned behavior, and self\u2010determination theory). Knowledge and integration of these theories in clinical practice may help patients to adopt and maintain EX or PA as part of their lifestyle 113. The American Cancer Society and American College of Sport Medicine recommend avoiding inactivity and suggest that patients with cancer should engage in regular PA. In detail, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, with flexibility and strength exercise two or three times per week should be performed 5, 114. This goal could be difficult to achieve, especially for physically deconditioned patients. For this reason, the EX program should be flexible (particularly during treatment periods), start easily, and progress slowly according to patient's rhythm and body response. Moreover, an interpatient heterogeneity in physical, psychological status, and treatment\u2010related side effects needs to be considered. According to available evidence, an accurate baseline assessment, including clinical, physical, and psychosocial conditions, is fundamental to schedule a tailored EX program. Recognizing the presence of relevant comorbidities to adapt activity and avoid potential EX\u2010induced risks is fundamental. The presence of extreme fatigue or high physical limitation could be a contraindication to start an EX program, or a low cardiorespiratory fitness may suggest performing EX with low intensity and for short time 5.\n      Considering all these factors, in clinical practice close collaboration among oncologists and kinesiologists (or cancer exercise specialists or physiotherapists) may allow developing specific EX programs based on patient's needs, preferences, and physical and psychological status. The final aims are to improve patient's physical fitness and quality of life, reduce treatment\u2010related side effects, and increase the motivation to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle over time (Fig. 2).

Although available evidence provides a strong rationale to continue pursuing and investigating these aspects from both a clinical and translational point of view, current results remain not decisive because of methodological limitations of the performed trials, small numbers of patients included (mainly affected by early\u2010stage lung cancer), and a general lack of tailored EX programs, taking into account individual patients\u2019 conditions, comorbidities, and preferences.\n      A common topic emerging from available experiences explores the potential synergistic impact of strongly integrated interdisciplinary approaches, encompassing coordinated EX and PA, nutritional, and psychological and behavioral interventions. From a theoretical standpoint, it is reasonable to speculate that behavioral and psychological intervention or counseling may reinforce motivation and compliance, thus potentially favoring adherence to tailored EX programs. On the other hand, nutritional counseling may help to counteract sarcopenia and muscle wasting, thereby rendering EX more effective in maintaining muscle mass and improving strength. Indeed, a meta\u2010analysis showed that combined EX and psychological intervention is more effective than a pharmacological approach to counteract fatigue 8. Similarly, an integrated approach encompassing EX, dietary guidance, social counseling, and a smoking cessation program 51 clearly improved QoL, emotional well\u2010being, and mental health, while reducing anxiety, depression, and distress. Overall, the impact of PA and EX on QoL endpoints appears to be potentially more profound when administered as part of a multidimensional, comprehensive approach to physical, nutritional, and psychological well\u2010being.\n      In this regard, a further step to improve the awaited benefit deriving from PA and EX may be achieved by embedding a personalized physical exercise program within a multidimensional teamwork intervention for oncological patients. In this light, we are currently offering a patient\u2010centered approach provided by an integrated team, including dietitians, kinesiologists, and psychologists coordinated by a medical oncologist (the Focus On Research and CarE team [FORCE]). On one hand, these nonpharmacological interventions may help improve QoL, physical functions, psychological aspects, and treatment\u2010related adverse events and reduce symptoms and complications occurring during cancer care. On the other, we hypothesize that such a comprehensive approach may influence patients\u2019 immune status, thereby ultimately affecting treatment outcome (in particular for patients undergoing immunotherapy). Based on a rigorous scientific method, we aim to (A) derive tissue\u2010 and blood\u2010based immunological signature(s) predicting the outcome of immunological therapy, (B) demonstrate that EX (in context with nutritional counseling and behavioral interventions provided in an integrated fashion by the FORCE team) favorably modifies such predictive signatures, and (C) test (in a formal clinical trial) the hypothesis that specific EX preconditioning schemes (again in the context of a multidisciplinary intervention) improve the outcome(s) of patients with lung cancer undergoing immunotherapy.\nAuthor Contributions\n      \nConception/design: Alice Avancini, Giulia Sartori, Anastasios Gkountakos, Miriam Casali, Ilaria Trestini, Daniela Tregnago, Emilio Bria, Lee W.
