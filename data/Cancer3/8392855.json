A high expression of the lncRNA insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 to 1 (IGFBP4-1) was associated with greater lymph node metastasis and facilitated lung cancer cell migration and invasion via metabolic reprogramming mechanism by increasing HK2 expression.124 The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is preferentially expressed during developmental embryo stages and in various tumor cells.155 PKM2 transforms the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis and leads to cancer-specific glycolysis, thus promoting glucose uptake and lactic acid production.155 In the nucleus, the direct reciprocity of PKM2 with TGF-\u03b2-induced factor homeobox 2 resulted in the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 to the E-cadherin promoter.156 This was followed by histone H3 deacetylation and the inhibition of E-cadherin transcription, thereby facilitating EMT in colon cancer cells.156 LncRNA-AC020978 was upregulated and promoted cell metastasis in NSCLC cells125; it stabilized PKM2 by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated degradation, increasing PKM2-enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 transcription activity, and facilitating glycolytic metabolism and lung cancer metastasis.125 Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is an essential metabolic enzyme in glycolysis; it catalyzes 1,3-bisphosphate glycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate and generates the first ATP in the glycolysis.157 Several studies reported that PGK1 played an important role in cancer metastasis.158,159 Xie et al160 showed that PGK1 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and overexpressed PGK1 is correlated with poor prognosis.

    "description": "Introduction\n      Lung cancer is the most lethal malignancy accounting for 18% of total cancer deaths.1 Cancer statistics from 2021 indicated that the disease accounted for \u223c22% of\ncancer-related deaths, with 235,760 new cases of bronchial and lung cancer diagnosed\nin the United States.2 In China, the age-standardized mortality rate for lung cancer is 18.1%, which\nranks first in the cancer spectrum.3 After lung cancer diagnosis at all stages, <7% of patients survive for 10 years.3 The disease typically incorporates two pathological subtypes: nonsmall cell\nlung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is the main subtype and\nincludes lung adenocarcinoma (LAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and\nlarge-cell carcinoma. These cancers are induced by smoking, radon exposure, viral\ninfection, and other harmful factors.4\u20136\n      Lung cancer metastasis is a key factor implicated in lung cancer recurrence and death.7 Generally, the metastatic cascade contains several discrete stages: nascent\ntumor cells invade surrounding tissues and intravasate into the vascular system\nwhere they survive in the circulatory system. They then extravasate through\ndysfunctional vascular walls into target tissues or organ sites where they expand\nand grow.8 During the local invasion, normal epithelial cells undergo depolarization,\nlosing cell\u2013cell interactions, transforming into mesenchymal cells, and acquiring a\nmetastatic phenotype.9 This complicated process is termed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT)\nand is the driving force of tumor cell invasion.10 Nascent tumor cells then break epithelial junctions by exploiting\nmatrix-degrading enzymes induced by EMT to access the circulation via leaky and\ncircuitous tumor vasculature induced by angiogenesis.11 However, after detaching from primary sites, disseminated tumor cells must\nresist programmed apoptosis termed anoikis.12 Finally, disseminated tumor cells colonize at distant sites.13 Metastasis is a complex and intricate cancer behavior; therefore, a better\nunderstanding of metastatic processes will help us overcome the heavy burden of lung cancer.13\n      The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements project indicates that the human genome is generally\ntranscribed into multiple nonprotein-coding RNA molecules, commonly referred to as\nnoncoding RNAs (ncRNAs).14 In general, based on molecular size, ncRNAs are categorized into two major\ntypes: short ncRNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs).15 Short ncRNAs are composed of <200 nucleotides and include microRNAs\n(miRNAs), small interfering RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs.16 Conversely, lncRNAs are a novel group of RNA transcripts measuring >200\nnucleotides, but they do not encode peptides.17 Many studies have reported that lncRNAs participate in multiple physiological\nprocesses, including cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, invasion, and\ncellular energy metabolism.18,19 Similarly, their aberrant expression is particularly related to\nseveral diseases, especially cancers.20 Several studies have demonstrated that the abnormal expression of lncRNAs\nexerts key functions in lung cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.21\u201323 Emerging\nstudies have also reported that lncRNAs are promising therapeutic targets for\ntreating lung cancer metastasis.21,22 Therefore, exploring the\nregulatory mechanisms underpinning lncRNA expression in lung cancer metastasis is\nwarranted.\n      In this review, we comprehensively explored lncRNAs in lung cancer metastasis and\nsummarized key mechanisms behind their regulation with a view to advance our\nknowledge of lung cancer metastasis.\nOverview of lncRNAs: Biogenesis, Classification, and Function\n      LncRNAs are endogenous transcripts transcribed by RNA polymerase II, with many\nlncRNAs harboring a 7mC cap and poly-A tail similar to messenger RNA (mRNA).17 lncRNAs are located in both coding and noncoding gene regions. Based on their\nrelative proximity to neighboring genes and genomic origins, lncRNAs are broadly\nclassified into six categories (Figure 1): (1) intergenic lncRNAs originating from intergenic regions of\nprotein-coding genes; (2) intronic lncRNAs transcribed from intronic regions of\nprotein-coding genes; (3) bidirectional lncRNAs produced from the promoter of a\ncoding transcript, but in a divergent direction; (4) sense lncRNAs that cover exons\nof neighboring protein-coding genes in the same direction; (5) antisense lncRNAs\ntranscribed in the opposite direction to a neighboring coding transcript; and (6)\nenhancer lncRNAs generated from enhancer regions.17,24\n      \n        Figure 1.\n        \n          Classification of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).\n        \n        \n      \n      It was reported that lncRNA functions are strongly associated with their subcellular localization.25 Evidence from human cells using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in\nsitu-hybridization revealed diverse lncRNA subcellular localization patterns,\nincluding specific nuclear locations and nonspecific localization to both the\nnucleus and cytoplasm.26 The wide-ranging subcellular localization of lncRNAs suggests diverse modes\nof action (Figure 2).\n      \n        Figure 2.\n        \n          Function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).\n        \n        \n      \n      lncRNAs play important roles in nuclear architecture as they are involved in the\ncreation and maintenance of nuclear paraspeckles.27 Additionally, lncRNAs modify gene expression by guiding chromatin modifiers\nto genomic loci.28 Other lncRNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm where they function as sponges for\nmiRNAs to regulate gene expression.29\n      lncRNAs also play crucial roles in transcription as they interact with transcription\nfactors to activate or interfere with these processes.30 Moreover, lncRNAs posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by\ninteracting with RNA-binding proteins to influence splicing and translation.31 Further, lncRNAs control protein stability by regulating proteasome-mediated degradation.32\nMolecular Mechanisms of lncRNAs in Lung Cancer Metastasis\n      \n        lncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis by Sponging miRNAs\n        miRNAs regulate gene expression by regulating mRNA at the posttranscriptional level.33 A previous study has reported that lncRNAs sponge certain miRNAs to alter\nmiRNA abundance and suppress downstream target gene expression.34 This molecular model is termed competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that is\nessential for cancer progression.35 Here, we describe several lncRNAs that serve as ceRNAs to regulate lung\ncancer metastasis (Table\n1).\n        \n          Table 1.\n          \n            LncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis Through Sponging miRNAs.\n          \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  LncRNA\n                  Expression\n                  Cancer type\n                  Molecular mechanism\n                  Function\n                  Reference\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  LCAT1\n                  Up\n                  LAD\n                  Sponges miR-4715 to 5p to upregulate RAC1\n                  Promotes tumor metastasis in vivo.\n                  Yang et al36\n                \n                \n                  MALAT1\n                  Up\n                  LAD\n                  Regulates miR-204/SLUG;

LCAT1 directly\nsponges miR-4715 to 5p to increase the expression of the Rac family small\nGTPase 1 (RAC1), thus promoting tumor metastasis in vivo.36\n          Elevated metastasis-associated LAD transcript 1 (MALAT1) expression is\nrelated to a high metastatic risk in patients with early stage LAD.37 Gutschner et al38 reported that MALAT1 promotes lung tumor nodule formation in vivo;\nhowever, detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, several studies\nindicated that MALAT1 acted as a ceRNA to increase the expression of\nmetastasis-related genes, including zinc-finger transcription repressor\nSNAI2 (SLUG), neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated\n9 (NEDD9), and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), by competitively sponging\nmiR-204, miR-145 to 5p, and miR-200a-3p.39\u201341\n          Wang et al42 revealed that urogenital carcinoma antigen 1 (UCA1) is upregulated\nduring NSCLC progression. Using receiver operating characteristic curve\nanalysis, these authors showed that plasma UCA1 demonstrates a considerable\ndiagnostic value for detecting NSCLC. Moreover, UCA1 promoted NSCLC\nmetastasis by sponging miRNA-193a to increase high-mobility group protein B1\n(HMGB1) expression.43 HMGB1 is a highly conserved nuclear DNA-binding protein with an\nessential role in gene transcription,60 eg, remodeling and spacing factor 1-intronic transcript 2 (RSF1-IT2)\nis transcriptionally activated by HMGB1.44 Highly expressed RSF1-IT2 promoted NSCLC metastasis by sponging\nmiR-129 to 5p and upregulating the expression of snail family\ntranscriptional repressor 1. Importantly, upregulated RSF1-IT2 induced by\nHMGB1 was strongly associated with tumor metastasis in xenograft nude mice.44 These findings suggest that HMGB1 and its related lncRNAs may be\npotential therapeutic targets for NSCLC.\n          The miR-200 family suppresses EMT by directly targeting EMT markers, such as\nE-cadherin, zinc-finger e-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and ZEB2.61 Imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) is one such oncogenic\nlncRNA reported to promote NSCLC metastasis by acting as a ceRNA of miR-200a.45 Intriguingly, lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1),\nwhich is upregulated in NSCLC and related to positive lymph node metastasis,\nwas shown to sponge miR-200a and miR-200b to increase matrix\nmetalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression, thereby promoting NSCLC\nmetastasis.46,47 These studies identified a novel mechanism whereby\nthe miR-200 family serves as an upstream regulator of MMP9.\n          Similarly, HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) was shown to\nfacilitate NSCLC migration and metastasis by modulating miR-203 and miR-613\nexpression.48,49 Using bioinformatics, Chen et al50 revealed that HOTAIR shares conserved binding sites for miR-217 with\nDachshund homolog 1 (DACH1). Moreover, silencing HOTAIR suppressed NSCLC\ncell migration and invasion by enhancing miR-217 expression, which was\nreversed by DACH1.50 Therefore, HOTAIR can function as a potential marker for NSCLC\ndiagnosis and treatment.\n          Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 pseudogene 3 (SUMO1P3) is upregulated in\nNSCLC and promotes cell invasion and migration by sponging miR-136.51 Intriguingly, SUMO1P3 expression was not associated with clinical\nprognosis in patients with NSCLC, suggesting that SUMO1P3 may be regulated\nby other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes during NSCLC development.51 This association warrants further investigation.\n          Distal-less homeobox 6 antisense 1 (DLX6-AS1) is an oncogenic lncRNA known to\nfacilitate NSCLC cell invasion and migration by regulating the\nmiR-27b-3p/G1\u2013S phase transition 1 (GSPT1) and miR-144/proline-rich 11\n(PRR11) axis. These interactions may contribute to a comprehensive\nunderstanding of tumorigenesis in lung cancer.52,53\n        \n        \n          Tumor-Suppressive lncRNAs act as ceRNAs\n          DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5 (DGCR5) plays a crucial role in cell\nproliferation, invasion, and metastasis in different cancers.62 In NSCLC, DGCR5 inhibits tumor cell migration and metastasis by\nregulating miR-211 to 5p and EPH receptor B6 (EPHB6) expression.54 Luo et al55 reported that increased DGCR5 expression is related to a low\nincidence of lymph node metastasis in patients with LSCC. Their study also\nrevealed that DGCR5 interacts with miR-873 to 5p and upregulates tumor\nsuppressor candidate 3 expression (TUSC3), thereby suppressing A549 cell\n(human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells) migration and invasion.55 Collectively, these findings suggested that DGCR5 may function as a\npotential therapeutic target for lung cancer.\n          Forkhead box D3 antisense RNA 1 (FOXD3-AS1) is downregulated in NSCLC and\nassociated with lymph node metastasis.56 Overexpressed FOXD3-AS1 restrains H1299 cell (human nonsmall cell\nlung carcinoma cell line) invasion by indirectly upregulating SRC kinase\nsignaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) expression by targeting miR-150.56 Therefore, FOXD3-AS1 is a potential target for improved NSCLC\ntreatment.\n          lncRNA leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1 (LIFR-AS1)\ndisplayed significantly lower expression in NSCLC tissues than in normal\ntissues. In vivo and in vitro studies by Wang et al57 demonstrated that LIFR-AS1 sponges miR-942 to 5p to increase\nzinc-finger protein 471 (ZNF471) expression. Notably, ZNF471 served as a\ntumor suppressor by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.57 Therefore, LIFR-AS1 inhibited NSCLC metastasis via the miR-942 to\n5p/ZNF471 axis.\n          Gong et al58 determined a hitherto unknown role for the lncRNA GATA6 antisense RNA\n1 (GATA6-AS1)/miR-543/raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) regulatory axis.\nThese authors discovered that the axis inhibits NSCLC metastasis and\nproposed it as a valuable therapeutic approach for patients with late-stage\nmetastatic NSCLC.58 Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies showed that the novel lncRNA,\nHLA complex group 11 (HCG11), which is downregulated in NSCLC, upregulated\nthe expression and activity of suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) by\nsponging miR-522 to 3p and suppressing tumor metastasis and growth.59\n        \n      \n      \n        LncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis by Regulating Signaling\nPathways\n        In recent years, cancer-related classical signaling pathways have been recognized\nas crucial factors in the complicated regulatory network of cancer progression\nand have provided key clues for overcoming cancer.63\u201365 Studies have revealed\nthat lncRNAs regulate lung cancer metastasis via several diverse signaling\npathways, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),66 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),67 wingless/integrated (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin,68 Hippo,69 and p5370 (Figure 3).\n        \n          Figure 3.\n          \n            Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate lung cancer metastasis through\nregulating signaling pathways.\n          \n          \n        \n        \n          PI3K Signaling Pathway\n          PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) is one of the most important intercellular\nsignaling pathways contributing to cancer progression, metastasis, and\nmetabolism.71,72 For example, the knockdown of long intergenic\nnoncoding RNA 00152 repressed NSCLC cell migration and invasion by reducing\nPI3K/AKT pathway activity.73 Liu et al74 reported that lncRNA tumor protein P73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1)\nexpression is significantly increased in LAD tissues and is associated with\npoor prognosis. Moreover, TP73-AS1 contributed to cell migration and\ninvasion by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.74 The novel lncRNA, Fer-1-like protein 4 (FER1L4) was downregulated in\nboth in vivo and in vitro NSCLC models. Overexpressed FER1L4 suppressed cell\nmetastasis by reducing PI3K and AKT expression.75 Additionally, lncRNA HOXB cluster antisense RNA 3 significantly\nincreased PI3Kp85a protein expression and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway to\nexacerbate NSCLC invasion and migration both in vitro and in\nvivo.76\n          Vimentin-associated lncRNA (VAL) is a potent oncogenic molecule upregulated\nduring AKT overexpression in LAD cells.77 Mechanistically, AKT overactivation induced VAL by enhancing the\ntranscriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription\n3 (STAT3). This process promoted tumor invasion, anoikis resistance, and metastasis77 and indicated that VAL was an essential lncRNA in overactivated\nAKT-mediated LAD metastasis.\n        \n        \n          MAPK Signaling Pathway\n          MAPKs are classical serine/tyrosine-activated kinases that regulate cell\nproliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.78 The MAPK signal transduction pathway is divided into four branches:\n(1) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), (2) c-Jun NH2-terminal\nkinase, (3) p38/MAPK, and (4) ERK5.78\n          lncRNAs are essential MAPK pathway regulators, eg, transcribed ultraconserved\nelement 338 was reported to facilitate NSCLC cell invasion and migration by\ndirectly activating MAPK signaling.67 LINC00852 is another oncogenic lncRNA that targeted the S100\ncalcium-binding protein A9 to promote LAD spinal metastasis by activating\nthe MAPK pathway.79 Therefore, LINC00852 is a promising target for early intervention\nagainst LAD spinal metastasis.\n          Additionally, Zhu and He80 reported that terminal differentiation-induced noncoding RNA (TINCR)\nis significantly elevated in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. Upregulated TINCR\nexpression was related to enhanced NSCLC cell migration and viability by\nincreasing the kinase activity of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene\nhomolog B (BRAF) to activate the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, TINCR\npromoted xenograft tumor growth in mouse models.80 Therefore, the BRAF/MAPK pathway is essential for the oncogenic role\nof TINCR.\n        \n        \n          Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin Signaling Pathway\n          The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is a major regulatory factor in cancer metastasis.81 Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P)\nis a novel lncRNA that activates tumorigenesis in NSCLC cells.82 Enhanced PDIA3P expression significantly promoted cell metastasis and\ntumor growth in vivo. In addition, PDIA3P activated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\nsignaling pathway during NSCLC development,82 suggesting that PDIA3P is an essential regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\npathway. Moreover, lncRNA feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1\nantisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1-AS1) was upregulated in NSCLC, with high FLVCR1-AS1\nlevels related to lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor histological\ngrades. FLVCR1-AS1 silencing directly inhibited \u03b2-catenin and c-Myc\nexpression, thereby inhibiting NSCLC cell invasion and migration.83\n          Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BCYRN1) is another oncogenic lncRNA upregulated in\nseveral malignant tumors, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, and glioma.84 Wang et al85 demonstrated that BCYRN1 is upregulated in NSCLC and promotes cell\nproliferation and metastasis by increasing the expression of cell cycle\nregulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1, and stimulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\nsignaling pathway. This study showed that BCYRN1 facilitated NSCLC\nprogression via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, thus highlighting a promising\ntherapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.\n        \n        \n          Hippo Signaling Pathway\n          The Hippo signaling pathway influences tissue growth and regeneration by\ninhibiting Yes-associated protein (YAP) and the transcriptional coactivator\nwith PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Dysregulated Hippo signaling facilitates\nuncontrolled cell proliferation and is associated with\ntumorigenesis.86,87 Gastric carcinoma\nhighly expressed transcript 1 knockdown inhibited NSCLC cell EMT and\ninvasion by decreasing YAP1 expression.88 Cadherin 1 (CDH1) is a cell\u2013cell adhesion molecule that establishes\ncell polarity and regulates epithelial differentiation and proliferation.89 Evidence indicated that CDH1 downregulation promoted tumor metastasis.90 The oncogenic lncRNA nonsmall cell LCAT1 (NSCLCAT1) reportedly\npromoted NSCLC cell metastasis by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway by\ntranscriptionally inhibiting CDH1.91 Therefore, the functional inhibition of NSCLCAT1 may prove to be a\nnovel therapeutic strategy to control metastatic NSCLC.\n        \n        \n          P53 Signaling Pathway\n          As the guardian of the genome, p53 plays a central role in regulating genomic\nstability, DNA damage repair, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.92 p53 is deregulated in many cancers and regulates the expression of\nmultiple target genes resulting in tumor growth inhibition.93 Generally, p53 levels are controlled by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway.94 The E3 ubiquitin ligase, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), acts as a p53\nsuppressor by promoting its ubiquitination.94 Notably, lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was reported to\nactivate p53 by inhibiting MDM2, leading to suppressed cell invasion in NSCLC.70\n          Additionally, lncRNAs may function as downstream targets of p53, eg,\nNONMMUT015812 was remarkably increased in mice with LAD and promoted cell\ninvasion and migration. Intriguingly, p53 negatively regulated NONMMUT015812 expression.95 PVT1b is a stress-specific PVT1 isoform activated by p53; activated\nPVT1b promoted transcriptional inhibition of Myc and inhibited cellular\nproliferation in LAD cell lines.96 Furthermore, PVT1b loss enhanced tumor growth that indicated a\npotential to control lung cancer development by regulating PVT1b activity.96\n          Overall, p53 signaling pathway functions in lung cancer are partially\nmanifested by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, and as such, lncRNAs\nmay play crucial roles in these processes.\n          Although lncRNAs regulate cancer-related signaling pathways, the current\nliterature is not comprehensive. Notably, several pathways have not yet been\ncharacterized with respect to lung cancer metastasis, eg, Ras and\nmesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition factor signaling pathways. Therefore, more\nresearch is required to explore downstream genes associated with these\npathways during lung cancer metastasis.\n        \n      \n      \n        LncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis by Coordinating With Enhancer of\nZeste Homolog 2 (EZH2)\n        \n          LncRNAs Bind to EZH2\n          EZH2 maps to chromosome 7q35 and is a histone\u2013lysine methyltransferase\nsubunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).97 PRC2 serves as a methyltransferase of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)\nand facilitates transcriptional inhibition by modulating chromatin\nstructures via posttranslational histone modification.98\n          EZH2 catalyzes the mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K27 and plays a\ncrucial role in epigenetic gene silencing.99 Compelling evidence has suggested that EZH2 modulates many biological\nfunctions in lung cancer.100 Li et al101 showed that EZH2 functions as an anticancer molecule by directly\nbinding to the nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)\npromoter, thus reducing Nrf2 expression and upregulating H3K27me3, leading\nto tumor growth reduction. Another study by Xia et al102 reported that EZH2 exerts positive effects on lung cancer cell\nmigration and invasion by upregulating chemokine ligand 5 expression.\nHowever, detailed mechanisms remain unclear.\n          LncRNAs can interact with EZH2 to affect lung cancer metastasis,100 eg, lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) was overexpressed in\nSCLC and facilitated cell migration, invasion, and proliferation.103 The lncRNA affected cell metastasis by modulating Lin11, Isl-1, and\nMec-3 kinase 2b (LIMK2b) expression via EZH2 binding.103 As a member of LIMK2, LIMK2b is mapped on 300 kp of TUG1 and\nparticipated in tumor growth and metastasis by encoding a kinase that\nregulated cofilin phosphorylation and promoted actin dynamics.104,105\nTherefore, TUG1 promoted SCLC metastasis by inhibiting LIMK2b expression via\nEZH2 binding.\n          Small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20) served as an oncogenic molecule by\nenhancing NSCLC proliferation and migration.106 Notably, SNHG20 inhibited p21 transcription by recruiting EZH2 to its promoter.106 p21 belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family, mediates\nthe growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and\ninhibits tumorigenesis.107 Therefore, EZH2-mediated p21 repression is essential for the\noncogenic role of SNHG20. However, other mechanisms whereby SNHG20 functions\nin NSCLC development require more exploration.\n          Moreover, prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) and UFC1 are other\nlncRNAs that promote NSCLC metastasis by interacting with EZH2.108,109\n        \n        \n          LncRNAs Serve as EZH2 Regulators or Effectors\n          In addition to repressing gene expression by binding to EZH2, lncRNAs also\nserve as EZH2 regulators or effectors,100 eg, lncRNA SOX2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot) facilitated tumor\nmetastasis and indicated poor prognosis in esophageal cancer, pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, and ovarian cancer.110 Sox2ot was also upregulated in NSCLC and predicted shorter patient\nsurvival.111,112 Upregulated Sox2ot also promoted NSCLC cell\nmigration and invasion.113 Depleted Sox2ot downregulated EZH2 expression and precluded cell\ngrowth, and similarly, increased EZH2 expression reversed the effects\ninduced by Sox2ot knockdown.111 These data suggested that Sox2ot mediated NSCLC progression partially\nby modulating EZH2 expression.\n          The SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) was downregulated in NSCLC and\nrelated to poor prognosis.114 Overexpressed SPRY4-IT1 suppressed EMT and increased apoptosis in\nNSCLC cells.114 Furthermore, EZH2 inhibited SPRY4-IT1 expression by binding to its\npromoter region.114 In EZH2-depleted cells, which showed impaired metastasis, SPRY4-IT1\nsilencing rescued oncogenic phenotypes, suggesting that SPRY4-IT1\nsuppression played a key role in EZH2-mediated oncogenesis.114 Similarly, Wei et al115 reported that EZH2 induces the suppression of lncRNA SVUGP2, leading\nto enhanced NSCLC migration and invasion. Overall, these studies suggest\nthat downregulated SPRY4-IT1 or SVUGP2 may predict a higher metastatic risk\nfor patients with NSCLC.\n          Many lncRNAs regulate lung cancer metastasis by interacting with EZH2 (Table 2).\nMoreover, lncRNAs can be regulated by EZH2. Thus far, lncRNA\u2013EZH2 regulatory\nnetwork data implicated in epigenetic regulation are preliminary; however,\nthe comprehensive investigation of these processes will undoubtedly identify\na mass of as-yet untapped therapeutic targets for lung cancer.\n          \n            Table 2.\n            \n              LncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis Through Interacting with\nEZH2.\n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    LncRNA\n                    Cancer type\n                    Expression\n                    Molecular mechanism\n                    Function\n                    Reference\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    TUG1\n                    SCLC\n                    Up\n                    Represses LIMK2b expression via binding to EZH2\n                    Promotes metastasis\n                    Niu et al103\n                  \n                  \n                    SNHG20\n                    NSCLC\n                    Up\n                    Represses p21 expression via binding to EZH2\n                    Promotes metastasis\n                    Chen et al106\n                  \n                  \n                    PCAT6\n                    NSCLC\n                    Up\n                    Represses LATS2 expression via binding to EZH2\n                    Promotes metastasis\n                    Shi et al108\n                  \n                  \n                    UFC1\n                    NSCLC\n                    Up\n                    Represses PTEN expression via binding to EZH2\n                    Promotes metastasis\n                    Zang et al109\n                  \n                  \n                    Sox2ot\n                    NSCLC\n                    Up\n                    Promotes EZH2 expression\n                    Promotes metastasis\n                    Hou et al,111 Kamel et al,112 and Zhang et al113\n                  \n                  \n                    SPRY4-IT1\n                    NSCLC\n                    Down\n                    EZH2 reduces its expression\n                    Inhibits metastasis\n                    Sun et al114\n                  \n                  \n                    SVUGP2\n                    NSCLC\n                    Down\n                    EZH2 reduces its expression\n                    Inhibits metastasis\n                    Wei et al115\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Abbreviations: EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2;

Recently, several studies\nindicated that MALAT1 acted as a ceRNA to increase the expression of\nmetastasis-related genes, including zinc-finger transcription repressor\nSNAI2 (SLUG), neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated\n9 (NEDD9), and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), by competitively sponging\nmiR-204, miR-145 to 5p, and miR-200a-3p.39\u201341\n          Wang et al42 revealed that urogenital carcinoma antigen 1 (UCA1) is upregulated\nduring NSCLC progression. Using receiver operating characteristic curve\nanalysis, these authors showed that plasma UCA1 demonstrates a considerable\ndiagnostic value for detecting NSCLC. Moreover, UCA1 promoted NSCLC\nmetastasis by sponging miRNA-193a to increase high-mobility group protein B1\n(HMGB1) expression.43 HMGB1 is a highly conserved nuclear DNA-binding protein with an\nessential role in gene transcription,60 eg, remodeling and spacing factor 1-intronic transcript 2 (RSF1-IT2)\nis transcriptionally activated by HMGB1.44 Highly expressed RSF1-IT2 promoted NSCLC metastasis by sponging\nmiR-129 to 5p and upregulating the expression of snail family\ntranscriptional repressor 1. Importantly, upregulated RSF1-IT2 induced by\nHMGB1 was strongly associated with tumor metastasis in xenograft nude mice.44 These findings suggest that HMGB1 and its related lncRNAs may be\npotential therapeutic targets for NSCLC.\n          The miR-200 family suppresses EMT by directly targeting EMT markers, such as\nE-cadherin, zinc-finger e-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and ZEB2.61 Imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) is one such oncogenic\nlncRNA reported to promote NSCLC metastasis by acting as a ceRNA of miR-200a.45 Intriguingly, lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1),\nwhich is upregulated in NSCLC and related to positive lymph node metastasis,\nwas shown to sponge miR-200a and miR-200b to increase matrix\nmetalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression, thereby promoting NSCLC\nmetastasis.46,47 These studies identified a novel mechanism whereby\nthe miR-200 family serves as an upstream regulator of MMP9.\n          Similarly, HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) was shown to\nfacilitate NSCLC migration and metastasis by modulating miR-203 and miR-613\nexpression.48,49 Using bioinformatics, Chen et al50 revealed that HOTAIR shares conserved binding sites for miR-217 with\nDachshund homolog 1 (DACH1). Moreover, silencing HOTAIR suppressed NSCLC\ncell migration and invasion by enhancing miR-217 expression, which was\nreversed by DACH1.50 Therefore, HOTAIR can function as a potential marker for NSCLC\ndiagnosis and treatment.\n          Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 pseudogene 3 (SUMO1P3) is upregulated in\nNSCLC and promotes cell invasion and migration by sponging miR-136.51 Intriguingly, SUMO1P3 expression was not associated with clinical\nprognosis in patients with NSCLC, suggesting that SUMO1P3 may be regulated\nby other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes during NSCLC development.51 This association warrants further investigation.\n          Distal-less homeobox 6 antisense 1 (DLX6-AS1) is an oncogenic lncRNA known to\nfacilitate NSCLC cell invasion and migration by regulating the\nmiR-27b-3p/G1\u2013S phase transition 1 (GSPT1) and miR-144/proline-rich 11\n(PRR11) axis. These interactions may contribute to a comprehensive\nunderstanding of tumorigenesis in lung cancer.52,53\n        \n        \n          Tumor-Suppressive lncRNAs act as ceRNAs\n          DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5 (DGCR5) plays a crucial role in cell\nproliferation, invasion, and metastasis in different cancers.62 In NSCLC, DGCR5 inhibits tumor cell migration and metastasis by\nregulating miR-211 to 5p and EPH receptor B6 (EPHB6) expression.54 Luo et al55 reported that increased DGCR5 expression is related to a low\nincidence of lymph node metastasis in patients with LSCC. Their study also\nrevealed that DGCR5 interacts with miR-873 to 5p and upregulates tumor\nsuppressor candidate 3 expression (TUSC3), thereby suppressing A549 cell\n(human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells) migration and invasion.55 Collectively, these findings suggested that DGCR5 may function as a\npotential therapeutic target for lung cancer.\n          Forkhead box D3 antisense RNA 1 (FOXD3-AS1) is downregulated in NSCLC and\nassociated with lymph node metastasis.56 Overexpressed FOXD3-AS1 restrains H1299 cell (human nonsmall cell\nlung carcinoma cell line) invasion by indirectly upregulating SRC kinase\nsignaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) expression by targeting miR-150.56 Therefore, FOXD3-AS1 is a potential target for improved NSCLC\ntreatment.\n          lncRNA leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1 (LIFR-AS1)\ndisplayed significantly lower expression in NSCLC tissues than in normal\ntissues. In vivo and in vitro studies by Wang et al57 demonstrated that LIFR-AS1 sponges miR-942 to 5p to increase\nzinc-finger protein 471 (ZNF471) expression. Notably, ZNF471 served as a\ntumor suppressor by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.57 Therefore, LIFR-AS1 inhibited NSCLC metastasis via the miR-942 to\n5p/ZNF471 axis.\n          Gong et al58 determined a hitherto unknown role for the lncRNA GATA6 antisense RNA\n1 (GATA6-AS1)/miR-543/raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) regulatory axis.\nThese authors discovered that the axis inhibits NSCLC metastasis and\nproposed it as a valuable therapeutic approach for patients with late-stage\nmetastatic NSCLC.58 Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies showed that the novel lncRNA,\nHLA complex group 11 (HCG11), which is downregulated in NSCLC, upregulated\nthe expression and activity of suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) by\nsponging miR-522 to 3p and suppressing tumor metastasis and growth.59\nOncogenic lncRNAs act as ceRNAs\n          lncRNA lung cancer-associated transcript 1 (LCAT1) is upregulated in LAD\ntissues and is closely correlated with poor prognosis.

Notably, ZNF471 served as a\ntumor suppressor by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.57 Therefore, LIFR-AS1 inhibited NSCLC metastasis via the miR-942 to\n5p/ZNF471 axis.\n          Gong et al58 determined a hitherto unknown role for the lncRNA GATA6 antisense RNA\n1 (GATA6-AS1)/miR-543/raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) regulatory axis.\nThese authors discovered that the axis inhibits NSCLC metastasis and\nproposed it as a valuable therapeutic approach for patients with late-stage\nmetastatic NSCLC.58 Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies showed that the novel lncRNA,\nHLA complex group 11 (HCG11), which is downregulated in NSCLC, upregulated\nthe expression and activity of suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) by\nsponging miR-522 to 3p and suppressing tumor metastasis and growth.59\nLncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis by Regulating Signaling\nPathways\n        In recent years, cancer-related classical signaling pathways have been recognized\nas crucial factors in the complicated regulatory network of cancer progression\nand have provided key clues for overcoming cancer.63\u201365 Studies have revealed\nthat lncRNAs regulate lung cancer metastasis via several diverse signaling\npathways, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),66 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),67 wingless/integrated (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin,68 Hippo,69 and p5370 (Figure 3).\n        \n          Figure 3.\n          \n            Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate lung cancer metastasis through\nregulating signaling pathways.\n          \n          \n        \n        \n          PI3K Signaling Pathway\n          PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) is one of the most important intercellular\nsignaling pathways contributing to cancer progression, metastasis, and\nmetabolism.71,72 For example, the knockdown of long intergenic\nnoncoding RNA 00152 repressed NSCLC cell migration and invasion by reducing\nPI3K/AKT pathway activity.73 Liu et al74 reported that lncRNA tumor protein P73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1)\nexpression is significantly increased in LAD tissues and is associated with\npoor prognosis. Moreover, TP73-AS1 contributed to cell migration and\ninvasion by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.74 The novel lncRNA, Fer-1-like protein 4 (FER1L4) was downregulated in\nboth in vivo and in vitro NSCLC models. Overexpressed FER1L4 suppressed cell\nmetastasis by reducing PI3K and AKT expression.75 Additionally, lncRNA HOXB cluster antisense RNA 3 significantly\nincreased PI3Kp85a protein expression and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway to\nexacerbate NSCLC invasion and migration both in vitro and in\nvivo.76\n          Vimentin-associated lncRNA (VAL) is a potent oncogenic molecule upregulated\nduring AKT overexpression in LAD cells.77 Mechanistically, AKT overactivation induced VAL by enhancing the\ntranscriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription\n3 (STAT3). This process promoted tumor invasion, anoikis resistance, and metastasis77 and indicated that VAL was an essential lncRNA in overactivated\nAKT-mediated LAD metastasis.\n        \n        \n          MAPK Signaling Pathway\n          MAPKs are classical serine/tyrosine-activated kinases that regulate cell\nproliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.78 The MAPK signal transduction pathway is divided into four branches:\n(1) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), (2) c-Jun NH2-terminal\nkinase, (3) p38/MAPK, and (4) ERK5.78\n          lncRNAs are essential MAPK pathway regulators, eg, transcribed ultraconserved\nelement 338 was reported to facilitate NSCLC cell invasion and migration by\ndirectly activating MAPK signaling.67 LINC00852 is another oncogenic lncRNA that targeted the S100\ncalcium-binding protein A9 to promote LAD spinal metastasis by activating\nthe MAPK pathway.79 Therefore, LINC00852 is a promising target for early intervention\nagainst LAD spinal metastasis.\n          Additionally, Zhu and He80 reported that terminal differentiation-induced noncoding RNA (TINCR)\nis significantly elevated in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. Upregulated TINCR\nexpression was related to enhanced NSCLC cell migration and viability by\nincreasing the kinase activity of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene\nhomolog B (BRAF) to activate the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, TINCR\npromoted xenograft tumor growth in mouse models.80 Therefore, the BRAF/MAPK pathway is essential for the oncogenic role\nof TINCR.\n        \n        \n          Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin Signaling Pathway\n          The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is a major regulatory factor in cancer metastasis.81 Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P)\nis a novel lncRNA that activates tumorigenesis in NSCLC cells.82 Enhanced PDIA3P expression significantly promoted cell metastasis and\ntumor growth in vivo. In addition, PDIA3P activated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\nsignaling pathway during NSCLC development,82 suggesting that PDIA3P is an essential regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\npathway. Moreover, lncRNA feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1\nantisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1-AS1) was upregulated in NSCLC, with high FLVCR1-AS1\nlevels related to lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor histological\ngrades. FLVCR1-AS1 silencing directly inhibited \u03b2-catenin and c-Myc\nexpression, thereby inhibiting NSCLC cell invasion and migration.83\n          Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BCYRN1) is another oncogenic lncRNA upregulated in\nseveral malignant tumors, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, and glioma.84 Wang et al85 demonstrated that BCYRN1 is upregulated in NSCLC and promotes cell\nproliferation and metastasis by increasing the expression of cell cycle\nregulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1, and stimulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\nsignaling pathway. This study showed that BCYRN1 facilitated NSCLC\nprogression via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, thus highlighting a promising\ntherapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.\n        \n        \n          Hippo Signaling Pathway\n          The Hippo signaling pathway influences tissue growth and regeneration by\ninhibiting Yes-associated protein (YAP) and the transcriptional coactivator\nwith PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Dysregulated Hippo signaling facilitates\nuncontrolled cell proliferation and is associated with\ntumorigenesis.86,87 Gastric carcinoma\nhighly expressed transcript 1 knockdown inhibited NSCLC cell EMT and\ninvasion by decreasing YAP1 expression.88 Cadherin 1 (CDH1) is a cell\u2013cell adhesion molecule that establishes\ncell polarity and regulates epithelial differentiation and proliferation.89 Evidence indicated that CDH1 downregulation promoted tumor metastasis.90 The oncogenic lncRNA nonsmall cell LCAT1 (NSCLCAT1) reportedly\npromoted NSCLC cell metastasis by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway by\ntranscriptionally inhibiting CDH1.91 Therefore, the functional inhibition of NSCLCAT1 may prove to be a\nnovel therapeutic strategy to control metastatic NSCLC.\n        \n        \n          P53 Signaling Pathway\n          As the guardian of the genome, p53 plays a central role in regulating genomic\nstability, DNA damage repair, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.92 p53 is deregulated in many cancers and regulates the expression of\nmultiple target genes resulting in tumor growth inhibition.93 Generally, p53 levels are controlled by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway.94 The E3 ubiquitin ligase, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), acts as a p53\nsuppressor by promoting its ubiquitination.94 Notably, lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was reported to\nactivate p53 by inhibiting MDM2, leading to suppressed cell invasion in NSCLC.70\n          Additionally, lncRNAs may function as downstream targets of p53, eg,\nNONMMUT015812 was remarkably increased in mice with LAD and promoted cell\ninvasion and migration. Intriguingly, p53 negatively regulated NONMMUT015812 expression.95 PVT1b is a stress-specific PVT1 isoform activated by p53; activated\nPVT1b promoted transcriptional inhibition of Myc and inhibited cellular\nproliferation in LAD cell lines.96 Furthermore, PVT1b loss enhanced tumor growth that indicated a\npotential to control lung cancer development by regulating PVT1b activity.96\n          Overall, p53 signaling pathway functions in lung cancer are partially\nmanifested by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, and as such, lncRNAs\nmay play crucial roles in these processes.\n          Although lncRNAs regulate cancer-related signaling pathways, the current\nliterature is not comprehensive. Notably, several pathways have not yet been\ncharacterized with respect to lung cancer metastasis, eg, Ras and\nmesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition factor signaling pathways. Therefore, more\nresearch is required to explore downstream genes associated with these\npathways during lung cancer metastasis.\nPI3K Signaling Pathway\n          PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) is one of the most important intercellular\nsignaling pathways contributing to cancer progression, metastasis, and\nmetabolism.71,72 For example, the knockdown of long intergenic\nnoncoding RNA 00152 repressed NSCLC cell migration and invasion by reducing\nPI3K/AKT pathway activity.73 Liu et al74 reported that lncRNA tumor protein P73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1)\nexpression is significantly increased in LAD tissues and is associated with\npoor prognosis.

Therefore, more\nresearch is required to explore downstream genes associated with these\npathways during lung cancer metastasis.\nLncRNAs Regulate Lung Cancer Metastasis by Coordinating With Enhancer of\nZeste Homolog 2 (EZH2)\n        \n          LncRNAs Bind to EZH2\n          EZH2 maps to chromosome 7q35 and is a histone\u2013lysine methyltransferase\nsubunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).97 PRC2 serves as a methyltransferase of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)\nand facilitates transcriptional inhibition by modulating chromatin\nstructures via posttranslational histone modification.98\n          EZH2 catalyzes the mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K27 and plays a\ncrucial role in epigenetic gene silencing.99 Compelling evidence has suggested that EZH2 modulates many biological\nfunctions in lung cancer.100 Li et al101 showed that EZH2 functions as an anticancer molecule by directly\nbinding to the nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)\npromoter, thus reducing Nrf2 expression and upregulating H3K27me3, leading\nto tumor growth reduction. Another study by Xia et al102 reported that EZH2 exerts positive effects on lung cancer cell\nmigration and invasion by upregulating chemokine ligand 5 expression.\nHowever, detailed mechanisms remain unclear.\n          LncRNAs can interact with EZH2 to affect lung cancer metastasis,100 eg, lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) was overexpressed in\nSCLC and facilitated cell migration, invasion, and proliferation.103 The lncRNA affected cell metastasis by modulating Lin11, Isl-1, and\nMec-3 kinase 2b (LIMK2b) expression via EZH2 binding.103 As a member of LIMK2, LIMK2b is mapped on 300 kp of TUG1 and\nparticipated in tumor growth and metastasis by encoding a kinase that\nregulated cofilin phosphorylation and promoted actin dynamics.104,105\nTherefore, TUG1 promoted SCLC metastasis by inhibiting LIMK2b expression via\nEZH2 binding.\n          Small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20) served as an oncogenic molecule by\nenhancing NSCLC proliferation and migration.106 Notably, SNHG20 inhibited p21 transcription by recruiting EZH2 to its promoter.106 p21 belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family, mediates\nthe growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and\ninhibits tumorigenesis.107 Therefore, EZH2-mediated p21 repression is essential for the\noncogenic role of SNHG20.

Overall, these studies suggest\nthat downregulated SPRY4-IT1 or SVUGP2 may predict a higher metastatic risk\nfor patients with NSCLC.\n          Many lncRNAs regulate lung cancer metastasis by interacting with EZH2 (Table 2).\nMoreover, lncRNAs can be regulated by EZH2.

Another study by Xia et al102 reported that EZH2 exerts positive effects on lung cancer cell\nmigration and invasion by upregulating chemokine ligand 5 expression.\nHowever, detailed mechanisms remain unclear.\n          LncRNAs can interact with EZH2 to affect lung cancer metastasis,100 eg, lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) was overexpressed in\nSCLC and facilitated cell migration, invasion, and proliferation.103 The lncRNA affected cell metastasis by modulating Lin11, Isl-1, and\nMec-3 kinase 2b (LIMK2b) expression via EZH2 binding.103 As a member of LIMK2, LIMK2b is mapped on 300 kp of TUG1 and\nparticipated in tumor growth and metastasis by encoding a kinase that\nregulated cofilin phosphorylation and promoted actin dynamics.104,105\nTherefore, TUG1 promoted SCLC metastasis by inhibiting LIMK2b expression via\nEZH2 binding.\n          Small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20) served as an oncogenic molecule by\nenhancing NSCLC proliferation and migration.106 Notably, SNHG20 inhibited p21 transcription by recruiting EZH2 to its promoter.106 p21 belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family, mediates\nthe growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and\ninhibits tumorigenesis.107 Therefore, EZH2-mediated p21 repression is essential for the\noncogenic role of SNHG20. However, other mechanisms whereby SNHG20 functions\nin NSCLC development require more exploration.\n          Moreover, prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) and UFC1 are other\nlncRNAs that promote NSCLC metastasis by interacting with EZH2.108,109\nLncRNAs Serve as EZH2 Regulators or Effectors\n          In addition to repressing gene expression by binding to EZH2, lncRNAs also\nserve as EZH2 regulators or effectors,100 eg, lncRNA SOX2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot) facilitated tumor\nmetastasis and indicated poor prognosis in esophageal cancer, pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, and ovarian cancer.110 Sox2ot was also upregulated in NSCLC and predicted shorter patient\nsurvival.111,112 Upregulated Sox2ot also promoted NSCLC cell\nmigration and invasion.113 Depleted Sox2ot downregulated EZH2 expression and precluded cell\ngrowth, and similarly, increased EZH2 expression reversed the effects\ninduced by Sox2ot knockdown.111 These data suggested that Sox2ot mediated NSCLC progression partially\nby modulating EZH2 expression.\n          The SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) was downregulated in NSCLC and\nrelated to poor prognosis.114 Overexpressed SPRY4-IT1 suppressed EMT and increased apoptosis in\nNSCLC cells.114 Furthermore, EZH2 inhibited SPRY4-IT1 expression by binding to its\npromoter region.114 In EZH2-depleted cells, which showed impaired metastasis, SPRY4-IT1\nsilencing rescued oncogenic phenotypes, suggesting that SPRY4-IT1\nsuppression played a key role in EZH2-mediated oncogenesis.114 Similarly, Wei et al115 reported that EZH2 induces the suppression of lncRNA SVUGP2, leading\nto enhanced NSCLC migration and invasion.

preexisting blood\ncapillaries or postcapillary venules and is a key process supplying nutrients\nand removing metabolites to promote tumor growth.132 Tumor-induced neovascularization frequently exhibits morphological\nalterations characterized by premature and circuitous vascular structures.116 High permeability in new vasculature structures promotes the direct entry\nof tumor cells into the circulation.133 Moreover, the irregular and unstable structure of these neovascular\nsystems lead to a dense vascular bed that increases contact surfaces between\ntumors and the bloodstream, promoting tumor access to the circulation and\nfacilitating distant metastasis.133 Therefore, angiogenesis is instrumental in primary tumor metastasis and\ngrowth.\n        Generally, angiogenesis is regulated by proangiogenic signaling pathways,\nincluding the vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth\nfactor receptor and angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 pathways.134 LncRNA tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2 antisense RNA 1 (TNK2-AS1) is\nupregulated in NSCLC tissues.117 TNK2-AS1 enhances NSCLC metastasis and interacts with STAT3 to elevate\nits stability by inhibiting proteasome-mediated degradation. STAT3 also binds to\nthe TNK2-AS1 promoter to activate its transcription. Moreover, this positive\nfeedback mechanism elevates vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)\nexpression to promote angiogenesis.117 Similarly, Wang et al118 reported that LOC100132354 promotes metastasis and induces angiogenesis\nin LAD by activating the VEGFA/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. Another study\ndemonstrated that LINC00667 promoted cell migration and pathological\nangiogenesis in NSCLC by increasing VEGFA mRNA stability by recruiting\neukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3).119\n        Moreover, lncRNA EPIC1 (Lnc-EPIC1) reportedly facilitated cell viability and\ninvasion in NSCLC.120 Elevated Lnc-EPIC1 expression stimulated angiogenesis by activating the\nAng2/Tie2 pathway, and furthermore, Lnc-EPIC1 overexpression simultaneously\nenhanced new blood vessel formation in vivo.120\n        Unequivocally, metastasis and angiogenesis are central topics in cancer, with\nlncRNAs participating in lung cancer metastasis by regulating angiogenesis.\nNevertheless, the precise molecular processes underpinning lncRNA-regulated\nangiogenesis in lung cancer metastasis are poorly characterized. Further\nresearch is warranted to uncover the clinical significance of lncRNAs in lung\ncancer angiogenesis.\n      \n      \n        LncRNAs Involved in Autophagy\n        Autophagy is an intricate biological process that maintains cellular homeostasis\nvia lysosome-dependent degradation.135 The process is activated under specific conditions, such as cellular\nstress, nutrient deficiency, and hypoxia.136 As a highly conserved process, autophagy plays vital roles in cellular\nenergy metabolism135,136 and is classified into three forms: microautophagy,\nmacroautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy.136 Macroautophagy, which is characterized by autophagosome engulfment of\ncorrupted cytoplasmic elements and fusion with lysosomes to promote material\ndegradation, is the most common autophagy type and displays contradictory\neffects during metastasis.135,137\u2013139 During primary\nmetastatic stages, autophagy inhibits metastasis by precluding tumor necrosis\nand reducing subsequent inflammatory cell infiltration.140 However, as metastasis invariably proceeds, autophagy promotes the\nprocess by protecting disseminating tumor cells from anoikis.140,141\nTherefore, autophagy is essential for metastasis.\n        In lung cancer, smoking and particulate matter-2.5 (PM-2.5) are critical\nenvironmental carcinogens that impair pulmonary function and facilitate\ntumorigenesis by inducing cell autophagy.142,143 Recent studies have\nreported that lncRNAs play essential roles in autophagy induced by environmental\ncarcinogens.121,122 For example, lung cancer progression-associated\ntranscript 1 (LCPAT1) knockdown suppressed smoking and PM-2.5-induced autophagy,\nthereby inhibiting EMT in NSCLC.121\n        Interestingly, in PM-2.5-exposed LAD cells, lncRNA loc146880 expression was\nupregulated due to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.122 Elevated loc146880 enhanced autophagy, leading to increased cell invasion\nand EMT. However, loc146880 knockdown reversed these positive effects induced by PM-2.5.122 Therefore, these data suggested that loc146880 enhanced autophagy to\npromote lung cancer metastasis in cancer cells exposed to PM-2.5.\n        Hypoxia also induces autophagy and promotes tumorigenesis.144 Under hypoxia, the tumor-suppressive role of lncRNA on chromosome 8p12\n(TSLNC8) reportedly suppressed the expression of autophagy-related proteins,\nincluding ATG14 and Beclin-1, leading to enhanced cell apoptosis and impaired\nNSCLC metastasis.123 Furthermore, overexpressed TSLNC8 decreased hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1\n(HIF-1\u03b1) levels and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, suggesting that TSLNC8\nregulated hypoxia-induced autophagy and NSCLC progression in a STAT3-dependent manner.123\n        Thus, autophagy induced by smoking, PM-2.5, or hypoxia is a crucial mechanism\nduring lung cancer metastasis, with lncRNAs increasingly recognized as essential\nmolecules regulating this process. Therefore, more research is required to\nexplore the complex relationship between autophagy and metastasis with the hope\nof identifying new lncRNA therapies for lung cancer treatment.\n      \n      \n        LncRNAs Involved in Aerobic Glycolysis\n        Reprogrammed energy metabolism, which enhances glycolysis and glucose uptake to\naccelerate cell proliferation, survival, and migration, has been identified as a\nmalignancy hallmark.116 Under normal physiological conditions, mitochondrial oxidative\nphosphorylation is the major energy source of the body that generates 30 or 32\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.145 However, cancer cells are inclined to obtain energy by enhancing\nglycolysis, which only generates two ATP molecules.146 To compensate for insufficient ATP production, cancer cells reprogram\nmetabolism to enhance the rate of glucose uptake.147 This specific phenomenon was first observed by Warburg in the 1920s and\ntermed the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis; thus, increased glucose uptake\npermits the synthesis of more metabolites, such as lactic acids, lipids, and\nnucleic acids, which favor tumor growth.146,148\n        Elevated glycolysis enhances glucose utilization, decreases ROS production, and\nelevates the antioxidant ability of cancer cells to resist anoikis and promote\nmetastasis.149,150 Similarly, tumor cells were shown to alter metabolism\nin remote organs to accelerate implantation and metastasis.151\n        Emerging evidence has suggested that lncRNAs are key players in cancer metabolic\nremodeling processes by targeting metabolic enzymes, eg, UCA1 is upregulated in\nglioma cells and upregulates\n6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 expression, a critical\nglycolytic enzyme, to induce cell migration and invasion.152 In lung cancer, lncRNAs are also shown to participate in metastasis\npartially by regulating glycolytic enzymes.124\n        The first step of glycolysis involves glucose phosphorylation to glucose\n6-phosphate by hexokinases (HKs) that are crucial glycolytic enzymes regulating\nglucose metabolic rates; thus, elevated HK expression maintains a rapid\nglycolytic rate in cancer tissues, facilitating cell metastasis.153 Geng et al154 reported that hexokinase 2 (HK2) modulates the expression of zonula\noccludens-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin and accelerates metastasis in\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells. A high expression of the lncRNA insulin-like\ngrowth factor binding protein 4 to 1 (IGFBP4-1) was associated with greater\nlymph node metastasis and facilitated lung cancer cell migration and invasion\nvia metabolic reprogramming mechanism by increasing HK2 expression.124\n        The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is preferentially expressed during\ndevelopmental embryo stages and in various tumor cells.155 PKM2 transforms the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis and leads to\ncancer-specific glycolysis, thus promoting glucose uptake and lactic acid production.155 In the nucleus, the direct reciprocity of PKM2 with TGF-\u03b2-induced factor\nhomeobox 2 resulted in the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 to the\nE-cadherin promoter.156 This was followed by histone H3 deacetylation and the inhibition of\nE-cadherin transcription, thereby facilitating EMT in colon cancer cells.156 LncRNA-AC020978 was upregulated and promoted cell metastasis in NSCLC cells125; it stabilized PKM2 by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated degradation,\nincreasing PKM2-enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 transcription activity, and facilitating\nglycolytic metabolism and lung cancer metastasis.125\n        Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is an essential metabolic enzyme in glycolysis;\nit catalyzes 1,3-bisphosphate glycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate and generates the\nfirst ATP in the glycolysis.157 Several studies reported that PGK1 played an important role in cancer\nmetastasis.158,159 Xie et al160 showed that PGK1 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and\noverexpressed PGK1 is correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, PGK1 knockdown\ndramatically decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting a positive role of PGK1 in\nhepatocellular carcinoma metastasis.160 Lowered expression of LINC01537 was associated with poor prognosis of\nlung cancer, whereas overexpressed LINC01537 limited aerobic glycolysis and\ninhibited metastasis in NSCLC cells.126 Further investigations showed that LINC01537 regulated PGK1 expression by\ndirectly targeting phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A), a critical member of the PDE\nfamily that modulates mitochondrial cyclic adenosine monophosphate expression\nand is highly associated with energy metabolism processes.126 Therefore, the LINC01537/PDE2A/PGK1 axis may be a potential target for\ninhibiting cellular energy metabolism and metastasis during NSCLC.\n        Since Weinberg identified metabolic reprogramming as an emerging cancer hallmark,\nseveral studies have validated the involvement of cancer metabolism during\nmalignant processes.116,150 LncRNAs regulate cancer glycolysis by modulating the\nexpression of several metabolic enzymes, resulting in lung cancer metastasis.\nImportantly, several reports have suggested that lncRNAs may alter the\ndistribution of glycolytic enzymes in human cancer cells, thus participating in\ncancer progression.161,162 However, in lung cancer, these things are missing.\nTherefore, further research is required to comprehensively understand the\ncomplex interaction networks that lncRNAs operate in cancer metabolic and\nmetastatic processes.\n      \n      \n        LncRNAs Involved in Immune escape\n        Tumorigenesis and metastatic cascades rely on the evolving molecular functions of\ncancer cells and interactions with the immune system.163 During each stage of the metastatic process, the immune system strives to\nblock cancer cell dissemination.164 For instance, CD8+ T cells recognize tumor-related antigens and\ndifferentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), leading to the specific\ndestructions of tumor cells.163,165 Accordingly, nascent\ntumor cells evolve evasive mechanisms to evade the immune system, including\nincreasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors, enlisting\nimmunosuppressive cells, and inhibiting the antitumor functions of\nCTLs.163,164 These processes decrease cancer cell immunogenicity,\nthereby establishing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributing to\ntumor metastasis.\n        Evidence has suggested that lncRNAs help lung tumor cells evade antitumor immune\nresponses, thus facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. Notably, lncRNA\nregulation during lung cancer immune escape broadly covers two areas: (1) the\ninfluence of lncRNAs on T cell activity and function and (2) lncRNA regulation\nof myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) activity and function.127,129,130\n        Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is an oncogenic lncRNA\nfacilitating lung cancer progression128; however, its molecular mechanism is unclear. Ma et al127 reported that NEAT1 knockdown represses NSCLC cell viability and invasion\nand upregulates tumor-infiltration CTLs. Further investigations revealed that\nNEAT1 silencing upregulated cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a stimulator of\ninterferon gene (STING) levels, and increased interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) expression.127 cGAS is a sensitive DNA sensor that responds to cytosolic DNA and\nmediates immune responses.166 Moreover, activated cGAS promotes activation of the STING pathway to\nproduce downstream factors, such as IFN-\u03b2.167 IFN-\u03b2 belongs to the type 1 IFN family that exerts significant\nstimulatory effects toward T cell activation, thereby improving T cell immune\nresponses and inhibiting cancer progression.168 Taken together, NEAT1 putatively promotes NSCLC metastasis by inhibiting\ncGAS-STING- IFN-\u03b2 signaling to repress T cell activation and help tumor cells\nevade immunosurveillance.\n        Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a specific mechanism regulating T cell\nactivity and function.169 It is a vital immune protection process that activates Fas (cluster of\ndiffraction 95)-Fas ligand signaling to restrict excessive T cell activation.169 However, AICD may be used to evade immunological assault to exert\nsignificant effects on cancer development.169 Evidence has revealed that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) interacting\nlncRNA (NKILA) participates in cancer metastasis by regulating the NF-\u03baB\npathway.170,171 Huang et al129 suggested that NKILA knockdown suppresses the AICD sensitivity of lung\ncancer cells lysates-activated CTLs, which was abrogated by NF-\u03baB\ndownregulation, suggesting that NKILA regulated AICD via the NF-\u03baB pathway. More\nimportantly, in NKILA-deletion mice, tumor apoptosis was elevated, and tumor\ngrowth was inhibited.129 Collectively, NKILA silencing in tumor-specific CTLs may combat tumor\nimmune escape by restricting AICD via NF-\u03baB signaling, thereby inhibiting tumor\ndevelopment and probably metastasis. These findings underscore the importance of\nlncRNAs in tumor immune escape and suggest that engineered lncRNAs in adoptively\ntransferred T cells may be a novel cancer immunotherapy.\n        MDSCs are immature immunosuppressive cells that differentiate into macrophages\nand monocytes.172 However, under pathological circumstances, particularly cancer, MDSCs\ndifferentiation is impeded; thus, they accumulate.173\u2013175 MDSCs also facilitate\ncancer metastasis by suppressing CTL responses and inducing regulatory T cells\nby generating inhibitory molecules, such as arginase 1, myeloperoxidase, and ROS.176 Previous studies showed that lncRNAs played critical roles in regulating\nMDSCs suppressive activities.177,178 Notably, lncRNA HOTAIR\nmyeloid-specific 1 (HOTAIRM1) was downregulated in LAD and associated with\nadvanced lymph node metastasis.131 Elevated HOTAIRM1 inhibited MDSCs immunosuppressive activities that\nimproved antitumor responses, retarded tumor growth, and delayed tumor metastasis.130 These findings indicated that HOTAIRM1 could be an immunotherapeutic\ntarget for lung cancer treatment.\n        These findings provide invaluable molecular clues on how lncRNAs influence immune\nresponses in tumor cells by regulating T cell and MDSC activity, thus promoting\nmetastasis. However, how lncRNAs modulate the immune microenvironment of lung\ncancer remains uncharacterized. More comprehensive research is required to\nexplore these linkages.\nLncRNAs Involved in Angiogenesis\n        Angiogenesis is the generation of new vasculature from preexisting blood\ncapillaries or postcapillary venules and is a key process supplying nutrients\nand removing metabolites to promote tumor growth.132 Tumor-induced neovascularization frequently exhibits morphological\nalterations characterized by premature and circuitous vascular structures.116 High permeability in new vasculature structures promotes the direct entry\nof tumor cells into the circulation.133 Moreover, the irregular and unstable structure of these neovascular\nsystems lead to a dense vascular bed that increases contact surfaces between\ntumors and the bloodstream, promoting tumor access to the circulation and\nfacilitating distant metastasis.133 Therefore, angiogenesis is instrumental in primary tumor metastasis and\ngrowth.\n        Generally, angiogenesis is regulated by proangiogenic signaling pathways,\nincluding the vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth\nfactor receptor and angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 pathways.134 LncRNA tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2 antisense RNA 1 (TNK2-AS1) is\nupregulated in NSCLC tissues.117 TNK2-AS1 enhances NSCLC metastasis and interacts with STAT3 to elevate\nits stability by inhibiting proteasome-mediated degradation. STAT3 also binds to\nthe TNK2-AS1 promoter to activate its transcription. Moreover, this positive\nfeedback mechanism elevates vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)\nexpression to promote angiogenesis.117 Similarly, Wang et al118 reported that LOC100132354 promotes metastasis and induces angiogenesis\nin LAD by activating the VEGFA/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. Another study\ndemonstrated that LINC00667 promoted cell migration and pathological\nangiogenesis in NSCLC by increasing VEGFA mRNA stability by recruiting\neukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3).119\n        Moreover, lncRNA EPIC1 (Lnc-EPIC1) reportedly facilitated cell viability and\ninvasion in NSCLC.120 Elevated Lnc-EPIC1 expression stimulated angiogenesis by activating the\nAng2/Tie2 pathway, and furthermore, Lnc-EPIC1 overexpression simultaneously\nenhanced new blood vessel formation in vivo.120\n        Unequivocally, metastasis and angiogenesis are central topics in cancer, with\nlncRNAs participating in lung cancer metastasis by regulating angiogenesis.\nNevertheless, the precise molecular processes underpinning lncRNA-regulated\nangiogenesis in lung cancer metastasis are poorly characterized.

Therefore, more research is required to\nexplore the complex relationship between autophagy and metastasis with the hope\nof identifying new lncRNA therapies for lung cancer treatment.\nLncRNAs Involved in Aerobic Glycolysis\n        Reprogrammed energy metabolism, which enhances glycolysis and glucose uptake to\naccelerate cell proliferation, survival, and migration, has been identified as a\nmalignancy hallmark.116 Under normal physiological conditions, mitochondrial oxidative\nphosphorylation is the major energy source of the body that generates 30 or 32\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.145 However, cancer cells are inclined to obtain energy by enhancing\nglycolysis, which only generates two ATP molecules.146 To compensate for insufficient ATP production, cancer cells reprogram\nmetabolism to enhance the rate of glucose uptake.147 This specific phenomenon was first observed by Warburg in the 1920s and\ntermed the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis; thus, increased glucose uptake\npermits the synthesis of more metabolites, such as lactic acids, lipids, and\nnucleic acids, which favor tumor growth.146,148\n        Elevated glycolysis enhances glucose utilization, decreases ROS production, and\nelevates the antioxidant ability of cancer cells to resist anoikis and promote\nmetastasis.149,150 Similarly, tumor cells were shown to alter metabolism\nin remote organs to accelerate implantation and metastasis.151\n        Emerging evidence has suggested that lncRNAs are key players in cancer metabolic\nremodeling processes by targeting metabolic enzymes, eg, UCA1 is upregulated in\nglioma cells and upregulates\n6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 expression, a critical\nglycolytic enzyme, to induce cell migration and invasion.152 In lung cancer, lncRNAs are also shown to participate in metastasis\npartially by regulating glycolytic enzymes.124\n        The first step of glycolysis involves glucose phosphorylation to glucose\n6-phosphate by hexokinases (HKs) that are crucial glycolytic enzymes regulating\nglucose metabolic rates; thus, elevated HK expression maintains a rapid\nglycolytic rate in cancer tissues, facilitating cell metastasis.153 Geng et al154 reported that hexokinase 2 (HK2) modulates the expression of zonula\noccludens-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin and accelerates metastasis in\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells. A high expression of the lncRNA insulin-like\ngrowth factor binding protein 4 to 1 (IGFBP4-1) was associated with greater\nlymph node metastasis and facilitated lung cancer cell migration and invasion\nvia metabolic reprogramming mechanism by increasing HK2 expression.124\n        The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is preferentially expressed during\ndevelopmental embryo stages and in various tumor cells.155 PKM2 transforms the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis and leads to\ncancer-specific glycolysis, thus promoting glucose uptake and lactic acid production.155 In the nucleus, the direct reciprocity of PKM2 with TGF-\u03b2-induced factor\nhomeobox 2 resulted in the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 to the\nE-cadherin promoter.156 This was followed by histone H3 deacetylation and the inhibition of\nE-cadherin transcription, thereby facilitating EMT in colon cancer cells.156 LncRNA-AC020978 was upregulated and promoted cell metastasis in NSCLC cells125; it stabilized PKM2 by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated degradation,\nincreasing PKM2-enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 transcription activity, and facilitating\nglycolytic metabolism and lung cancer metastasis.125\n        Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is an essential metabolic enzyme in glycolysis;\nit catalyzes 1,3-bisphosphate glycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate and generates the\nfirst ATP in the glycolysis.157 Several studies reported that PGK1 played an important role in cancer\nmetastasis.158,159 Xie et al160 showed that PGK1 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and\noverexpressed PGK1 is correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, PGK1 knockdown\ndramatically decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting a positive role of PGK1 in\nhepatocellular carcinoma metastasis.160 Lowered expression of LINC01537 was associated with poor prognosis of\nlung cancer, whereas overexpressed LINC01537 limited aerobic glycolysis and\ninhibited metastasis in NSCLC cells.126 Further investigations showed that LINC01537 regulated PGK1 expression by\ndirectly targeting phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A), a critical member of the PDE\nfamily that modulates mitochondrial cyclic adenosine monophosphate expression\nand is highly associated with energy metabolism processes.126 Therefore, the LINC01537/PDE2A/PGK1 axis may be a potential target for\ninhibiting cellular energy metabolism and metastasis during NSCLC.\n        Since Weinberg identified metabolic reprogramming as an emerging cancer hallmark,\nseveral studies have validated the involvement of cancer metabolism during\nmalignant processes.116,150 LncRNAs regulate cancer glycolysis by modulating the\nexpression of several metabolic enzymes, resulting in lung cancer metastasis.\nImportantly, several reports have suggested that lncRNAs may alter the\ndistribution of glycolytic enzymes in human cancer cells, thus participating in\ncancer progression.161,162 However, in lung cancer, these things are missing.\nTherefore, further research is required to comprehensively understand the\ncomplex interaction networks that lncRNAs operate in cancer metabolic and\nmetastatic processes.\nLncRNAs Involved in Immune escape\n        Tumorigenesis and metastatic cascades rely on the evolving molecular functions of\ncancer cells and interactions with the immune system.163 During each stage of the metastatic process, the immune system strives to\nblock cancer cell dissemination.164 For instance, CD8+ T cells recognize tumor-related antigens and\ndifferentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), leading to the specific\ndestructions of tumor cells.163,165 Accordingly, nascent\ntumor cells evolve evasive mechanisms to evade the immune system, including\nincreasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors, enlisting\nimmunosuppressive cells, and inhibiting the antitumor functions of\nCTLs.163,164 These processes decrease cancer cell immunogenicity,\nthereby establishing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributing to\ntumor metastasis.\n        Evidence has suggested that lncRNAs help lung tumor cells evade antitumor immune\nresponses, thus facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. Notably, lncRNA\nregulation during lung cancer immune escape broadly covers two areas: (1) the\ninfluence of lncRNAs on T cell activity and function and (2) lncRNA regulation\nof myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) activity and function.127,129,130\n        Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is an oncogenic lncRNA\nfacilitating lung cancer progression128; however, its molecular mechanism is unclear. Ma et al127 reported that NEAT1 knockdown represses NSCLC cell viability and invasion\nand upregulates tumor-infiltration CTLs. Further investigations revealed that\nNEAT1 silencing upregulated cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a stimulator of\ninterferon gene (STING) levels, and increased interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) expression.127 cGAS is a sensitive DNA sensor that responds to cytosolic DNA and\nmediates immune responses.166 Moreover, activated cGAS promotes activation of the STING pathway to\nproduce downstream factors, such as IFN-\u03b2.167 IFN-\u03b2 belongs to the type 1 IFN family that exerts significant\nstimulatory effects toward T cell activation, thereby improving T cell immune\nresponses and inhibiting cancer progression.168 Taken together, NEAT1 putatively promotes NSCLC metastasis by inhibiting\ncGAS-STING- IFN-\u03b2 signaling to repress T cell activation and help tumor cells\nevade immunosurveillance.\n        Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a specific mechanism regulating T cell\nactivity and function.169 It is a vital immune protection process that activates Fas (cluster of\ndiffraction 95)-Fas ligand signaling to restrict excessive T cell activation.169 However, AICD may be used to evade immunological assault to exert\nsignificant effects on cancer development.169 Evidence has revealed that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) interacting\nlncRNA (NKILA) participates in cancer metastasis by regulating the NF-\u03baB\npathway.170,171 Huang et al129 suggested that NKILA knockdown suppresses the AICD sensitivity of lung\ncancer cells lysates-activated CTLs, which was abrogated by NF-\u03baB\ndownregulation, suggesting that NKILA regulated AICD via the NF-\u03baB pathway. More\nimportantly, in NKILA-deletion mice, tumor apoptosis was elevated, and tumor\ngrowth was inhibited.129 Collectively, NKILA silencing in tumor-specific CTLs may combat tumor\nimmune escape by restricting AICD via NF-\u03baB signaling, thereby inhibiting tumor\ndevelopment and probably metastasis. These findings underscore the importance of\nlncRNAs in tumor immune escape and suggest that engineered lncRNAs in adoptively\ntransferred T cells may be a novel cancer immunotherapy.\n        MDSCs are immature immunosuppressive cells that differentiate into macrophages\nand monocytes.172 However, under pathological circumstances, particularly cancer, MDSCs\ndifferentiation is impeded; thus, they accumulate.173\u2013175 MDSCs also facilitate\ncancer metastasis by suppressing CTL responses and inducing regulatory T cells\nby generating inhibitory molecules, such as arginase 1, myeloperoxidase, and ROS.176 Previous studies showed that lncRNAs played critical roles in regulating\nMDSCs suppressive activities.177,178 Notably, lncRNA HOTAIR\nmyeloid-specific 1 (HOTAIRM1) was downregulated in LAD and associated with\nadvanced lymph node metastasis.131 Elevated HOTAIRM1 inhibited MDSCs immunosuppressive activities that\nimproved antitumor responses, retarded tumor growth, and delayed tumor metastasis.130 These findings indicated that HOTAIRM1 could be an immunotherapeutic\ntarget for lung cancer treatment.\n        These findings provide invaluable molecular clues on how lncRNAs influence immune\nresponses in tumor cells by regulating T cell and MDSC activity, thus promoting\nmetastasis. However, how lncRNAs modulate the immune microenvironment of lung\ncancer remains uncharacterized. More comprehensive research is required to\nexplore these linkages.\nConclusion and Perspectives\n      Metastasis causes high lethality and recurrence rates in lung cancer. Emerging\nstudies have increasingly identified lncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for\ntreating this disease. This review provided a comprehensive understanding of the\nmain molecular mechanisms and regulatory roles of several lncRNAs and their impact\non lung cancer metastasis. LncRNAs are an essential type of ncRNAs that regulate\nlung cancer metastasis via three main molecular mechanisms: (1) lncRNAs act as\nceRNAs; (2) lncRNAs regulate the transduction of several signal pathways; and (3)\nlncRNAs coordinate with EZH2. Thus, lncRNAs exert multiple functions toward lung\ncancer metastasis by regulating angiogenesis, autophagy, aerobic glycolysis, and\nimmune escape. Interestingly, the molecular mechanism of one particular lncRNA\ninvolves several aspects, eg, SNHG3 not only sponges miR-340 to 5p179 and miR-515 to 5p180 but also activates the TGF-\u03b2 pathway to promote lung cancer metastasis.181 However, lncRNA research is still in its infancy; therefore, future\ninvestigations should explore the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs and their impact\non lung cancer metastasis.\n      Moreover, dysregulated lncRNAs stably exist in internal environments, exhibit\nspecific expression profiles in different lung cancer subtypes, and provide\npotential options for lung cancer treatment. Current research on lncRNAs as\ndiagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers should focus on their application to clinical\nsettings; however, this requires comprehensive verification and authentication in\nlarge-scale studies. Going forward, this research strategy will significantly\nimprove lncRNA therapeutic outcomes in treating metastatic lung cancer.",
