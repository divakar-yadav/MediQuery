    "description": "INTRODUCTION\n      Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors of the respiratory system with a highly lethal malignancy and poor prognosis.\n1\n, \n2\n According to Global Cancer Statistics in 2020,\n3\n there will be a total of 2\u2009206\u2009771 new cases of lung cancer and 1\u2009796\u2009144 deaths, with deaths accounting for more than 80% of new cases, ranking second among causes of cancer deaths worldwide and first in China, and expected to rise to first in the United States in 2030.\n4\n Meanwhile, more than 90% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage that often misses the best time for treatment, and the 5\u2010year survival rate is only approximately 10%\u201320%.\n5\n To date, the main treatment strategy of lung cancer is still surgical resection combined with adjuvant therapy, but only 20% of patients are suitable for surgery, and 80% of patients experience recurrence and eventually die after surgery.\n6\n Therefore, it is important to seek a new treatment strategy to impede tumor progression and prolong the survival time of patients with lung cancer.\n      Growing evidence has illustrated that immunotherapy, especially monoclonal antibody\u2010targeted drugs, has been increasingly used in the clinical treatment of lung cancer, but still has many limitations.\n7\n Interestingly, clinical studies have shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\u2010T cells served as a kind of over\u2010the\u2010top T\u2010cell immunotherapy, which first, isolated T\u2010cells from patients' blood and genetically engineered the T cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells and kill them and is considered as safe and reliable immunotherapy in malignant tumors.\n8\n At present, CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy has achieved great success in hematological malignancies with an overall remission rate reaching more than 80%.\n9\n For example, clinical trials have verified that CAR\u2010T cells targeting CD19 exhibited a long\u2010lasting remission effect on drug\u2010resistant B\u2010cell malignancies, and the cure rate for patients with relapsed and refractory acute B\u2010lymphocytic leukemia was about 80%\u201390%.\n10\n Nowadays, there are five CAR\u2010T products targeting CD19 in the treatment of hematological malignancies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , which brought a new direction of cancer immunotherapy and antitumor road. Simultaneously, the success of CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy in the treatment of hematological malignancies provides new hope to cure solid tumors, and a range of solid tumors CAR\u2010T cell target antigens have been identified and are used in ongoing early clinical trials.\n11\n Several scientists have focused their attention on CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer and made good progress in clinical trials.\n12\n, \n13\n The results of the above studies indicated that CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy might be a novel strategy for lung cancer treatment.\n      The purpose of this review is to outline the recent research advances in CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for lung cancer, including the structure and generation of CAR\u2010T cells and antigens targeted. Moreover, we focus on the main challenges and future prospects of CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy against lung cancer, aiming to provide new ideas for the clinical trial design and treatment of lung cancer immunotherapy.\nTHE STRUCTURE AND GENERATION OF CAR\u2010T CELLS\n      \n        The structure of CAR\u2010T cells\n        CAR\u2010T cells, as one of the emerging treatment strategies for cancer immunotherapy, have become a new hot spot and focus in the field of cancer therapy research in recent years. CAR\u2010T cells are genetically engineered to isolate the patient's T cells outside the body and expressed single\u2010chain antibodies that specifically recognize and bind to antigens (e.g., CD19) on cancer cells.\n14\n CAR is mainly composed of an extracellular antigen recognition domain (ectodomain), a hinge and transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signal transduction domain (endodomain) (Figure\u00a01). The main structure of the extracellular antigen recognition domain is the single\u2010chain variable fragment (scFv) of the target antigen\u2013antibody, which consists of the heavy chain variable regions (VH) and the light chain variable regions (VL) of the specific antibody to the tumor\u2010associated antigen (TAA), preserving the recognition ability of the antibody, and this type of recognition ensures the specificity of the T cells in their killing action. The hinge and transmembrane structural domains are usually the transmembrane regions of CD8\u03b1 or CD28, which mainly serve to connect the extracellular and intracellular structural domains and contribute to the mutual recognition of CAR and antigen and the recruitment of stimulatory signals for CAR\u2010T activation.\n15\n The length or flexibility of the transmembrane structural domain can also affect the function of CAR.\n16\n The intracellular signal transduction structural domain mainly consists of the stimulatory factor CD3\u03b6 chain and is often combined with costimulatory molecules such as CD27, CD28, CD134 (OX\u201040), and CD137 (4\u20101BB), which initiate the activation of T cell function and also contribute to T cell proliferation and lifespan extension.\n17\n\n\n        \n          FIGURE 1\n          \n            The structure of CAR. ICOS, inducible costimulatory; ScFv, single\u2010chain variable fragment; VH, heavy chain variable; VL, light chain variable\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        The generation of CAR\u2010T cells\n        To date, CAR\u2010T cells are classified into five generations based on their intracellular signaling structural domains, with the main differences between CAR\u2010T cell generations being specific co\u2010stimulatory molecules (Figure\u00a02). The first generation of CAR\u2010T cells included only CD3\u03b6 as an intracellular signaling endodomain that fuses with extracellular scFv to modify and activate T cells.\n18\n Because first\u2010generation CAR\u2010T cells do not have co\u2010stimulatory molecules, they cannot provide prolonged triggering of T cell activation and therefore, have a little antitumor effect. To overcome this drawback, co\u2010stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD28, 4\u20101BB, and inducible costimulatory [ICOS]) were added to the second\u2010generation CARs structure to enhance T cell proliferation viability.\n19\n Previous studies have demonstrated that CD28\u2010CAR\u2010T cells were more potent in killing cancer cells, as well as 4\u20101BB\u2010CAR\u2010T cells exhibited lower depletion rates and longer\u2010lasting killing effects on cancer cells.\n20\n To improve the tumor killing ability of T cells, the third\u2010generation CARs are based on the second generation by continuing to add co\u2010stimulatory molecules to CARs, such as CD28 combined with OX\u201040/4\u20101BB.\n21\n Several studies showed that the levels of cytokine secretion in the third generation CAR\u2010T cells were upregulated and the inhibition effect on cancer cell proliferation was enhanced.\n22\n, \n23\n The fourth\u2010generation CARs, also known as T cells redirected for universal cytokine\u2010mediated killing (TRUCKs),\n24\n have increased genes encoding cytokines to further activate and recruit more immune cells against the immunosuppressive local tumor microenvironment by secreting a large number of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)\u201012, IL\u201015, and granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor, which contributes to the immunotherapy of solid tumors. Recent studies have pointed out that fifth\u2010generation CARs contain a segment of IL\u20102 receptor \u03b2 (IL\u20102R\u03b2) instead of OX\u201040/CD27. The IL\u20102R\u03b2 segment facilitates the levels of Janus kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription\u20103/5 in tumors,\n25\n, \n26\n but the safety and efficacy of fifth\u2010generation CARs are under investigation. Notably, the construction of complex overexpression fragments may affect the transduction efficiency of CAR\u2010T cells and even accelerate the depletion of CAR\u2010T cells.\n27\n To date, the second\u2010generation CAR\u2010T is more widely used and has more stable effects.\n        \n          FIGURE 2\n          \n            Different generations of CARs and development history.

Of note, the ideal TAA is expressed only in tumor cells and not absent in normal tissue cells (or, if expressed, at very low levels),\n28\n, \n29\n which is the most ideal antigenic target for CAR\u2010T cell therapy. However, it is difficult to obtain the ideal TAA for CAR\u2010T cell therapy in solid tumors as CD19 in hematological cancers.\n30\n, \n31\n Based on the previous clinical trials, we summarized a list

factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases,\n32\n that are highly expressed on the membrane surface of many solid tumor cells and are associated with tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and recurrence.\n33\n Scharpenseel et al.\n34\n demonstrated that EGFR expression was upregulated in the tissues of patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (primary tumors) and brain metastasis. Moreover, EGFR may serve as an effective target for the diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors.\n35\n, \n36\n Importantly, EGFR has been served as a novel target for antibody\u2010based immunotherapy in multiple tumors, including lung cancer.\n37\n The results of an EGFR\u2010positive relapsed/refractory NSCLC clinical trial (NCT01869166) showed that none of the patients got significant toxic side effects after anti\u2010EGFR CAR\u2010T cell therapy, two patients achieved partial remission (PR) and five patients had stable disease (SD) for 2\u20138\u00a0months. Pathological biopsies revealed that CAR\u2010T cells targeting EGFR could infiltrate tumor tissues and induce EGFR\u2010specific cytotoxicity. In addition, Zhang et al.\n38\n demonstrated that EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII)\u2010CAR\u2010T cells could effectively identify and kill EGFRvIII\u2010positive lung cancer cells by releasing cytokines including interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), as well as contributing to inhibiting the growth of transplanted tumors in vivo, indicating that CAR\u2010T cells targeting EGFRvIII are an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent recurrence and metastasis of lung cancer after surgery. Another phase I trial (NCT04153799) confirmed that C\u2010X\u2010C chemokine receptor (CXCR) type 5\u2010modified anti\u2010EGFR CAR\u2010T cells were used to evaluate the safety and feasibility in EGFR\u2010positive NSCLC patients. The above studies suggested that EGFR\u2010CAR\u2010T cells might function as immune killers through modulating tumor immune microenvironment in lung cancer.\n      \n      \n        Mesothelin\n        Mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell adhesion glycoprotein that promotes cancer invasion and metastasis.\n39\n, \n40\n MSLN overexpression was positively correlated with high tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in lung cancer patients,\n41\n as well as acted as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in malignant pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer.\n42\n MSLN has been reported to be a more desirable TAA for CAR\u2010T therapy in solid tumors.\n43\n, \n44\n, \n45\n In addition, multiple clinical studies of anti\u2010MSLN CAR\u2010T cells for the treatment of lung cancer are underway (NCT02414269 and NCT02580747). For example, an earlier clinical trial (NCT01583686) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was conducted to test the safety and feasibility of MSLN\u2010CAR\u2010T cells to treat advanced malignant tumors (including lung, pancreatic, malignant mesothelioma, cervical, and ovarian cancers). The results showed that a total of enrolling 15 patients in phase I clinical trial had the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 40% (6/15), including one case each of anemia, thrombocytopenia, constipation, and hypoxemia, and two cases of lymphopenia, whereas only one patient had stable disease (SD) during the 3.5\u2010month observation period. In vivo experiments showed that MLSN\u2010CAR\u2010T cells inhibited xenografts growth by exhibiting a significantly higher ability to kill cancer cells than T cells in NSCLC.\n46\n Another study confirmed that MSLN\u2010CAR\u2010T cell therapy significantly hampered tumor growth via thoracic injection and persisted in mice bodies for a long time.\n47\n Furthermore, the dual CAR\u2010T cells targeting MSLN and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antigens have stronger anti\u2010pancreatic cancer activity.\n48\n Taken together, MSLN may be an effective TAA for CAR\u2010T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy.\n      \n      \n        Mucin 1\n        Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane protein that facilitates cancer cell adhesion and metastasis.\n49\n, \n50\n Previous studies have confirmed that the expression of MUC1 was significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than in normal lung tissues.\n51\n Another study showed that knockdown of MUC1 significantly suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro, as well as inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of lung cancer.\n52\n Of note, MUC1 has been reported as a reliable target for immunotherapy of small cell lung cancer.\n53\n, \n54\n Wei et al.\n55\n showed that CAR\u2010T cells targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) and MUC1 significantly eliminated tumor cells of combination PSCA and MUC1 positive in NSCLC. In addition, there are ongoing anti\u2010MUC1 CAR\u2010T cells successively used in clinical trials (NCT02587689, NCT03525782, NCT03356808, NCT03198052, and NCT04842812) for lung cancer. The above studies indicate that anti\u2010MUC1 CAR\u2010T cells may be an effective strategy for immunotherapy of patients with lung cancer.\n      \n      \n        Inactive tyrosine\u2010protein kinase transmembrane receptor\n        Inactive tyrosine\u2010protein kinase transmembrane receptor (ROR1), a tyrosine kinase\u2010like orphan receptor, is upregulated in B cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer, but has very low expression in normal tissues.\n56\n A clinical trial at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (NCT02706392) evaluated anti\u2010ROR1 CAR\u2010T cells for the treatment of advanced ROR1\u2010positive and stage IV NSCLC and triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC), and the results showed that at least 6 of 30 patients recruited did not show dose\u2010limiting toxicity. Wallstabe et al.\n57\n demonstrated that treatment with anti\u2010ROR1 CAR\u2010T cells can effectively kill NSCLC and TNBC cells by a three\u2010dimensional tumor model. Therefore, CAR\u2010T cells targeting ROR1 provide a new strategy for the clinical treatment of lung cancer.\n      \n      \n        Carcinoembryonic antigen\n        CEA is highly expressed in lung cancer,\n58\n but lowly expressed in normal tissues and differentiated cells. Analysis of the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed that lung cancer patients with high CEA expression had a poor prognosis. Preclinical data have confirmed that the serum concentrations of CEA in patients with advanced NSCLC were correlated with the occurrence of brain metastases\n59\n and high CEA expression associated with clinicopathological characteristics in lung cancer patients including lymph node metastasis and vascular infiltration.\n60\n The above results provide a theoretical basis for clinical trials to assess the safety, efficacy, and maximum tolerated dose of anti\u2010CEA CAR\u2010T cell therapy in CEA\u2010positive lung cancer (NCT02349724 and NCT04348643).\n      \n      \n        Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\n        Previous studies have confirmed that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was highly expressed in lung cancer\n61\n and facilitated the proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of cancer cells.\n62\n HER2 served as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.\n63\n, \n64\n Zhao et al.\n65\n reported that anti\u2010HER2 CAR\u2010T cells exhibited an antitumor effect on HER2\u2010positive tumors in a xenogeneic mouse model. In addition, many scholars from both domestic and international are conducting clinical trials of anti\u2010HER2 CAR\u2010T cells for lung cancer (NCT03198052, NCT01935843, NCT02713984, NCT03740256, and NCT04660929) to validate the safety and efficacy of HER2\u2010CAR\u2010T cells in the treatment of HER2\u2010positive lung cancer. To date, clinical outcomes of anti\u2010HER2 CAR\u2010T cells for the treatment of lung cancer have not been reported.\n      \n      \n        Programmed death\u2010ligand 1\n        The therapeutic effect of CAR\u2010T cell therapy for NSCLC was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.\n66\n Programmed death\u2010ligand 1 (PD\u2010L1), an important immune checkpoint, was upregulated in multiple tumors,\n67\n and it can inhibit T cell proliferation and activation by binding to PD\u20101 on T cells, ultimately leading to immune escape of tumor cells.\n68\n Previous studies have shown that PD\u2010L1 antibody exhibited safe and exciting results in in vitro, in vivo experiments, and clinical trials in tumors, including lung cancer.\n69\n, \n70\n Moreover, CAR\u2010T cell targeting PD\u2010L1 and zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes is being evaluated for safety and efficacy in an ongoing early\u2010phase I trial for relapsed or refractory NSCLC (NCT03060343). Liu et al.\n71\n demonstrated that anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 CAR\u2010T cells significantly suppressed PD\u2010L1high NSCLC cell proliferation and the growth of xenograft tumors in mice, as well as radiotherapy combined with anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 CAR\u2010T cells exhibited cytotoxic activity against PD\u2010L1low NSCLC cells and xenograft tumors. However, a pilot study of anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for advanced lung cancer in a phase I trial was terminated because of serious adverse events (NCT03330834). Intriguingly, anti\u2010MUC1 CAR\u2010T combining PD\u20101 knockdown cells were used to assess the safety and efficacy for patients with advanced NSCLC in a phase II trial (NCT03525782).\n      \n      \n        B7\u2010H3\n        B7\u2010H3 is a member of the B7 immunoglobulin superfamily, which is highly expressed in various solid tumors, and it has received widespread attention as an effective biomarker for cancer immunotherapy.\n72\n Preclinical studies have shown that B7\u2010H3 inhibited T cell activation and effectively suppressed the proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic functions of activated T cells.\n73\n, \n74\n Importantly, B7\u2010H3 was overexpressed in tissues of patients with NSCLC,\n75\n and antibody immunotherapy targeting B7\u2010H3 does not produce toxicity to vital organs, which makes it an ideal anticancer target. Currently, the antibody\u2010drug MGC018 targeting B7\u2010H3 has shown potent antitumor activity in patient\u2010derived xenograft models of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.\n76\n In addition, B7\u2010H3\u2010CAR\u2010T cells exhibited effective antitumor activity in ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, and melanoma.\n77\n, \n78\n Tang et al.\n79\n demonstrated that injection of B7\u2010H3\u2010CAR\u2010T cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival time in melanoma transplanted model mice. Similarly, several clinical trials have been designed to test the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of B7\u2010H3\u2010targeted CAR\u2010T cells against lung cancer such as NCT04864821 and NCT03198052.\n      \n      \n        Other targeted antigens\n        Given the promise of CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy in preclinical models of lung cancer, new approaches to identify additional effective antigenic targets for lung cancer are being investigated. For example, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines,\n80\n as well as served as an effective therapeutic target for NSCLC.\n81\n Mao et al.\n82\n found a lung adenocarcinoma\u2010associated MAGE\u2010A1 antigen via analyzing cancer/testis antigen database, and MAGE\u2010A1\u2010specific CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma is effective and safe. In addition, there are many other candidate antigenic targets for CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy in lung cancer, including PSCA, tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2, phosphatidylinositol proteoglycan 3 (GPC3), folate receptors (FR\u03b1 and FR\u03b2), CD44v6, Lewis\u2010Y antigen, IL\u201013R\u03b12, L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), and disialoganglioside (GD2),\n83\n, \n84\n, \n85\n, \n86\n which have not yet completed clinical trials.\nEpidermal growth factor receptor\n        Numerous studies have confirmed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases,\n32\n that are highly expressed on the membrane surface of many solid tumor cells and are associated with tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and recurrence.\n33\n Scharpenseel et al.\n34\n demonstrated that EGFR expression was upregulated in the tissues of patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (primary tumors) and brain metastasis.

In addition, many scholars from both domestic and international are conducting clinical trials of anti\u2010HER2 CAR\u2010T cells for lung cancer (NCT03198052, NCT01935843, NCT02713984, NCT03740256, and NCT04660929) to validate the safety and efficacy of HER2\u2010CAR\u2010T cells in the treatment of HER2\u2010positive lung cancer. To date, clinical outcomes of anti\u2010HER2 CAR\u2010T cells for the treatment of lung cancer have not been reported.\nProgrammed death\u2010ligand 1\n        The therapeutic effect of CAR\u2010T cell therapy for NSCLC was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.\n66\n Programmed death\u2010ligand 1 (PD\u2010L1), an important immune checkpoint, was upregulated in multiple tumors,\n67\n and it can inhibit T cell proliferation and activation by binding to PD\u20101 on T cells, ultimately leading to immune escape of tumor cells.\n68\n Previous studies have shown that PD\u2010L1 antibody exhibited safe and exciting results in in vitro, in vivo experiments, and clinical trials in tumors, including lung cancer.\n69\n, \n70\n Moreover, CAR\u2010T cell targeting PD\u2010L1 and zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes is being evaluated for safety and efficacy in an ongoing early\u2010phase I trial for relapsed or refractory NSCLC (NCT03060343). Liu et al.\n71\n demonstrated that anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 CAR\u2010T cells significantly suppressed PD\u2010L1high NSCLC cell proliferation and the growth of xenograft tumors in mice, as well as radiotherapy combined with anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 CAR\u2010T cells exhibited cytotoxic activity against PD\u2010L1low NSCLC cells and xenograft tumors. However, a pilot study of anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for advanced lung cancer in a phase I trial was terminated because of serious adverse events (NCT03330834). Intriguingly, anti\u2010MUC1 CAR\u2010T combining PD\u20101 knockdown cells were used to assess the safety and efficacy for patients with advanced NSCLC in a phase II trial (NCT03525782).\nB7\u2010H3\n        B7\u2010H3 is a member of the B7 immunoglobulin superfamily, which is highly expressed in various solid tumors, and it has received widespread attention as an effective biomarker for cancer immunotherapy.\n72\n Preclinical studies have shown that B7\u2010H3 inhibited T cell activation and effectively suppressed the proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic functions of activated T cells.\n73\n, \n74\n Importantly, B7\u2010H3 was overexpressed in tissues of patients with NSCLC,\n75\n and antibody immunotherapy targeting B7\u2010H3 does not produce toxicity to vital organs, which makes it an ideal anticancer target. Currently, the antibody\u2010drug MGC018 targeting B7\u2010H3 has shown potent antitumor activity in patient\u2010derived xenograft models of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.\n76\n In addition, B7\u2010H3\u2010CAR\u2010T cells exhibited effective antitumor activity in ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, and melanoma.\n77\n, \n78\n Tang et al.\n79\n demonstrated that injection of B7\u2010H3\u2010CAR\u2010T cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival time in melanoma transplanted model mice. Similarly, several clinical trials have been designed to test the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of B7\u2010H3\u2010targeted CAR\u2010T cells against lung cancer such as NCT04864821 and NCT03198052.\nOther targeted antigens\n        Given the promise of CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy in preclinical models of lung cancer, new approaches to identify additional effective antigenic targets for lung cancer are being investigated. For example, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines,\n80\n as well as served as an effective therapeutic target for NSCLC.\n81\n Mao et al.\n82\n found a lung adenocarcinoma\u2010associated MAGE\u2010A1 antigen via analyzing cancer/testis antigen database, and MAGE\u2010A1\u2010specific CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma is effective and safe. In addition, there are many other candidate antigenic targets for CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy in lung cancer, including PSCA, tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2, phosphatidylinositol proteoglycan 3 (GPC3), folate receptors (FR\u03b1 and FR\u03b2), CD44v6, Lewis\u2010Y antigen, IL\u201013R\u03b12, L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), and disialoganglioside (GD2),\n83\n, \n84\n, \n85\n, \n86\n which have not yet completed clinical trials.\nLIMITATIONS AND STRATEGIES OF CAR\u2010T CELL THERAPY IN LUNG CANCER\n      In general, the study on CAR\u2010T cell therapy for lung cancer is still in the early exploration stage. A large number of clinical trials progressed slowly and got very limited efficacy, as well as several technical bottlenecks need to be solved. Unlike hematologic malignancies, several major challenges of CAR\u2010T cell therapy for lung cancer include on\u2010target/off\u2010tumor toxicity, TAA heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), neurological toxicity, cytokine release syndrome, etc. How to overcome these challenges is the current hot field of CAR\u2010T cell therapy in lung cancer.\n      \n        On\u2010target/off\u2010tumor toxicity and TAA heterogeneity\n        The most important problem with CAR\u2010T cell therapy for solid tumors is the lack of an ideal antigenic target. Numerous studies have shown that the key component to the success of these candidate target antigens of CAR\u2010T cells will depend on their safety and the degree of on\u2010target/off\u2010tumor toxicity.\n13\n For instance, Morgan et al.\n87\n reported that injection with anti\u2010ERBB2 CAR\u2010T cells resulted in a colon cancer patient with low ERBB2 expression in the normal lung tissues developing respiratory distress after 15\u2009minutes and eventually died after 5\u2009days. Off\u2010tumor toxicity of CAR\u2010T cells may cause normal organ dysfunction, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver damage, and gastrointestinal disorders.\n88\n To avoid these risks, several strategies have been used to deal with the problem of off\u2010tumor toxicity and TAA heterogeneity, including targeting mutated tumor\u2010specific antigens, targeting multiple tumor target antigens,\n89\n dual CAR system,\n90\n and suicide genes,\n91\n etc. Moreover, new technology single\u2010cell RNA sequencing may provide a more accurate target antigen expression profile for TAA selection, which can better predict the efficacy and toxicity of novel CAR\u2010T cell therapy in tumors.\n92\n Furthermore, designing CAR\u2010T cells targeting multi\u2010targets in combination may also be an effective strategy to enhance tumor eradication.\n93\n For example, Roybal et al.\n94\n found that the anti\u2010GFP and anti\u2010CD19 dual\u2010specific CAR\u2010T cells significantly inhibited K562 cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. Preclinical studies showed that GD2\u2010B7H3\n95\n or ROR1\u2010B7H3\n96\n synNotch CAR\u2010T cells significantly killed tumor cells with high specificity and efficacy and without toxicity to normal cells expressing the target antigen.\n      \n      \n        Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment\n        The clinical efficacy of CAR\u2010T cell therapy for solid tumors is restricted by the immunosuppressive TME, such as hypoxia, immunosuppressive signaling by cellular immune checkpoint receptors, oxidative stress, and tumor\u2010derived cytokine suppression, etc.\n97\n, \n98\n Meanwhile, previous studies have demonstrated that tumor cells can release a variety of immunosuppressive factors, including VEGF, IL\u20104, IL\u201010, TGF\u2010\u03b2, and prostaglandin E2, leading to the activation of suppressive immune cells such as regulatory T cells, myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells, and tumor\u2010associated macrophages.\n99\n Preclinical studies found that TME has been extensively characterized as hostile for T cells.\n100\n, \n101\n The above studies suggest that altering the immunosuppressive effects on the TME or reconstituting the TME may enhance the anticancer effects of CAR\u2010T cells in solid tumors. Rafiq et al.\n102\n demonstrated that PD\u20101\u2010blocking scFv secreting CAR\u2010T cells significantly prolonged the survival time of transplanted tumor\u2010bearing mice and initiated antitumor immune responses again on tumor recurrence in mice. Chen et al.\n103\n reported that CAR\u2010T cells overexpressing PD\u20101 dominant negative receptor could act as a \u201cdecoy receptor\u201d to bind and block PD\u2010L1/2 inhibitory signals. Zhou et al.\n104\n reported that IL\u20107/IL\u20105 exhibited antitumor activity by promoting CAR\u2010T cell proliferation ability, reducing CAR\u2010T cell apoptosis, and ameliorating immunosuppressive TME. Therefore, CAR\u2010T cells co\u2010expressing immune\u2010related factors may be an effective strategy for the clinical treatment of lung cancer.\n      \n      \n        Cytokine release syndrome\n        Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by T\u2010cell activation, usually manifested by fever, chills, muscle pain, generalized weakness, and systemic organ failure.\n105\n Clinical studies have shown that CRS was mainly caused by the activated CAR\u2010T cell resulted in a significant increase in the secretion of pro\u2010inflammatory factors (e.g., IL\u20106, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and TNF\u2010\u03b1) by immune cells (T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes/macrophages) that disrupt the balance between pro\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010inflammatory responses.\n106\n Previous studies have proved that a controlled gene \u201cdevice\u201d for CAR\u2010T cells was effective in reducing pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines secretion and clearing CAR\u2010T cells from the body in time for acute toxicity.\n107\n, \n108\n For example, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV\u2010TK), human inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9), mutant human thymidylate kinase (mTMPK), and human CD20 can be expressed in donor T cells\n109\n, \n110\n and have been shown to kill transduced CAR\u2010T cells during adverse events in the early clinical trials of immunotherapy. Similarly, Mestermann et al.\n111\n found that dasatinib acted as a CAR\u2010T cell \u201cswitch\u201d to control the biological function of CAR\u2010T cells on entry into the body and protect model mice from CRS. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that regulating the in vivo lifespan and kinetics of CAR\u2010T cells by optimizing CAR gene transfection\n112\n and using nanoparticles\n113\n can reduce and avoid CRS. Therefore, avoiding CRS damage after CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy will be a key issue to address and focus on in the treatment of lung cancer in the future.\n      \n      \n        Neurological toxicity\n        Neurotoxicity, also known as CAR\u2010T cell\u2010related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES), is characterized by various neurological symptoms such as headache, aphasia, and delirium, even cerebral hemorrhage, seizures, and death.\n114\n Previous studies have found that the systemic inflammatory response associated with CRS may contribute to the risk of complications CRES.\n115\n, \n116\n In addition, clinical studies have shown that the activation of endothelial cells facilitated the disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, allowing immune effector cells and inflammatory mediators to infiltrate into the central nervous system, leading to neurotoxicity.\n117\n, \n118\n Simultaneously, the autopsy report of the brains with fatal CRES showed that the patient's brain had endothelial dysfunction and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption.\n119\n CRES can be largely reversible and completely resolved after treatment with tocilizumab and dexamethasone, although neurotoxicity recovery was slower after treatment with tocilizumab for CRES patients with endothelial cell activation.\n117\n Collectively, an in\u2010depth understanding of the pathophysiology will be an important factor in reducing systemic CRES in the prospect of CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors.\nOn\u2010target/off\u2010tumor toxicity and TAA heterogeneity\n        The most important problem with CAR\u2010T cell therapy for solid tumors is the lack of an ideal antigenic target.

These modified CARs are being studied in animal models and clinical trials in an attempt to mitigate tumor antigen heterogeneity and may eventually form the next generation of CAR\u2010T cells.\n120\n In conclusion, the above efforts will provide safer and more effective clinical applications of CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors such as lung cancer.\nCONCLUSION\n      In this review, we summarized the structure and generation of CAR\u2010T cells, and the most commonly TAAs used in preclinical and clinical trials of CAR\u2010T cell therapy against lung cancer, as well as pointed out current challenges and novel strategies. Currently, although research on CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy against solid tumors is still in its infancy, the beneficial results of preliminary trials provide a theoretical foundation for their application in the subsequent clinical treatment of solid tumors. With the growing understanding of tumorigenesis, it is more important to cultivate and use patients' resources to fight the disease than other drugs. At the same time, combined with the insights into TME, screening of novel target antigens, and advances in molecular biotechnology, CAR\u2010T cell therapy may improve its current status in the near future. In recent years, CAR\u2010T cells have made great progress in the field of hematological tumors, which has stimulated the interest of many investigators to study the application of CAR\u2010T cells in lung cancer treatment, and several basic and early clinical trials of CAR\u2010T cells for solid tumors are underway. Importantly, improving the killing effect of CAR\u2010T cells on tumor cells and prolonging the survival time of patients with cancer are also urgent issues to be addressed in future research. In addition, combining CAR\u2010T cell with radio\u2010/chemotherapy may improve its current antitumor activity. In conclusion, with the continuous innovation of CAR\u2010T design ideas and treatment protocols, CAR\u2010T cell immunotherapy is expected to become a major \u201ctool\u201d for lung cancer treatment.\nAUTHOR ROLES\n      Long Chen and Fukun Chen designed the study and wrote this manuscript; Jindan Li, Yongzho Pu, Conghui Yang and Yue Wang compiled and analyzed the literature.
