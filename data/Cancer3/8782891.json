    "description": "Introduction\n      Lung cancer is on the rise globally [1] and is the most frequent cancer and cause of cancer death in men and women combined, and in women, the third most common cancer type and the second most common cause of cancer death [2]. Over the past two decades, a wealth of data has revealed gender differences in the incidence and prognosis of NSCLC. Studies have shown that women who have never smoked are about two and a half times more likely than men to develop lung cancer [3, 4]. Women are more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age than men [5]. There was no significant difference in the incidence of NSCLC between men and postmenopausal women, while the incidence in premenopausal women increased compared with the two groups [5, 6], suggesting that sex hormones (both endogenous and exogenous) play an important role in the occurrence and development of lung cancer [4]. Preclinical studies have found that the expression of estrogen receptors in lung cancer tissues is elevated, suggesting that estrogen is closely related to the incidence of NSCLC [7]. Short-term use of exogenous estrogen is protective, while long-term use increases the risk of lung cancer [8].\n      Estrogen is a steroidal steroid sex hormone, mainly including estradiol, estriol and estrone, which plays the functional role in promoting sexual organ development, maintaining normal female physiological cycle and promoting bone calcium deposition in the body. Estrogen acts on the corresponding target organs via the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway, exerting the above functions [9]. Estrogen nuclear receptors, including ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, are activated by ligands and translocated into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, binding to the corresponding estrogen response elements, and exert their effects by regulating the transcription of target genes [7]. There are 5 subtypes of ER\u03b2, mainly distributed in ovarian and lung tissue [4]. Studies have shown that ER\u03b2 is the main mediating receptor for the physiological effects of estrogen in the lung [10].\n      Circular RNA (circRNA) is a special type of non-coding RNA molecules. First identified in RNA viruses in the 1970s, circRNAs have long been thought to be results of faulty splicing of mRNAs [11]. In recent years, it has been found that it is a special class of endogenous non-coding RNA molecules, which are usually formed by the back-splicing of some exons and/or introns. CircRNA is ubiquitous in human cells and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level [12, 13]. Unlike traditional linear RNA (linear RNA, containing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends), circRNA molecules are in a closed loop structure, which is likely resistant to RNA exonuclease, and has more stable expression and is not easily degraded [14]. CircRNA has been well documented to play important roles in the regulation of tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance [13]. Even though there are some papers published exploring circRNAs\u2019 roles in lung cancer [15, 16], much remains to be done to understand the overall pathophysiological contributions of circRNAs to NSCLC.\n      As another type of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are short in length (20\u201324 nt), which have been demonstrated to affect the stability and translation of mRNAs through post-transcriptional regulation by binding to the mRNA 3\u2032UTRs of protein-coding genes. MiRNAs have been reported to play important roles in the regulation of the progression of many cancers [13, 17].\n      CXCR4 is a member of the C-X-C chemokine receptor family, which is associated with multiple types of cancer [18]. CXCR4 plays an important role in lung cancer metastasis, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of 352 amino acids [19], expressed in a variety of cells, selectively binding to its unique ligand CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1).The binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 induces intracellular signal transduction through multiple pathways, and plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, migration and metastasis of breast cancer [20], ovarian cancer [21], colorectal cancer [22] and other tumors.\n      In this study, we analyzed the changes in the expression of NSCLC-related circRNAs after modulating ER\u03b2 levels in NSCLC cells. We identified circ-TMX4 as a downstream target of ER\u03b2 that affects NSCLC invasion by acting as a miR-622 sponge and regulating CXCR4 expression, thereby a novel mechanism by which ER\u03b2 modulates circ-TMX4/miR-622 signaling to impact NSCLC cell invasion.\nMaterials and methods\n      \n        Human tissues\n        Clinical samples of lung cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from Department of Thoracic Surgery, Xiangya hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China. All samples were collected for research purpose. The scientific ethics consent was signed by patients before the study.\n      \n      \n        Reagents and materials\n        ER\u03b2, CXCR4, GAPDH antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

First, 100\u2009\u00b5l/well diluted Matrigel (1:20 dilution, BD Biosciences) was coated in the upper chamber with incubation in the 37\u2009\u00b0C humidified incubator for 2\u20134\u2009h. Then, 2\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well with serum-free medium was added in the upper chamber and 750\u2009\u03bcl media with 10% FBS /well was added into lower chambers. After incubated for 24\u2009h, wash the upper chamber and fix the invaded cells with methanol and stain the cells with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet. Each sample was conducted in triplicate wells and repeated multiple times.\n      \n      \n        Western blot assay\n        Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and 30\u2009\u00b5g proteins were taken for run on a SDS/PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). After blocking for 1\u2009h and rinsed with TBST for three times, the membrane was incubated in the corresponding primary antibody in a cold room with 4\u2009\u00b0C for overnight. Rinse the membrane with TBST for three times again and incubated it with secondary antibodies. Finally, take the images of the membrane by the ECL system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n      \n      \n        qRT-PCR assay\n        Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract the total RNA of lung cancer cells, and 2\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was used for the reverse transcription. The Bio-Rad CFX96 system was used to conduct and calculate the expression of RNA (mRNA and miRNA). The data were normalized by GAPDH (for mRNA) or U6 (for miRNA) and relative expression was assessed by 2\u0394\u0394Ct values. All primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Company.\n      \n      \n        Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)\n        Normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose were used sequentially to preclear the cell lysates. We then added anti-ER\u03b2 antibody (2.0\u2009\u03bcg) to the cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. IgG was used in the reaction for the negative control. Specific primer sets were designed to amplify a target sequence within the human TMX4 promoter and agarose gel electrophoresis was used to identify the PCR products.\n      \n      \n        Luciferase reporter assay\n        The human 5\u2032-promoter region of TMX4 was constructed into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Deletion mutants without the ER\u03b2 binding site in the TMX4 5\u2032 promoter was achieved with the Quick Change mutagenesis. The fragment of CXCR4 3\u2032 UTR with wild-type or mutant miRNA-response elements was cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega) downstream of the Renilla luciferase ORF. Cells were plated in 24-well plates and the cDNAs were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PRL-TK was used as an internal control that served as the baseline control response. Luciferase activity was measured 36\u201348\u2009h after transfection by Dual-Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s manual.\n      \n      \n        In vivo studies\n        1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells were suspended in 50\u2009\u03bcl serum-free media with 50\u2009\u03bcl Matrigel (Becton Dickinson & Co, CA, USA) and injected into the left lateral thorax of the mice as described previously [7, 23]. Tumor development and metastasis were monitored by non-invasive In Vivo Fluorescent Imager (IVIS Spectrum, Caliper Life Sciences) once a week. Mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks, tumors and any metastases were removed for studies. Animal experiments were approved by institutional animal care at Xiangya Hospital Central South University.\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 software. Data were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Differences were analyzed with the one-way ANOVA test, and significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nHuman tissues\n        Clinical samples of lung cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from Department of Thoracic Surgery, Xiangya hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.

We had applied Western blot assay for ER\u03b2 expression in 5 human LCa cell lines (H292, H1299, A549, H358 and H157) (Fig. S1A), and selected H1299 cell line with highest ER\u03b2 expression for knock down, and A549 cell line with lower ER\u03b2 expression for over expression. We first altered ER\u03b2 expression and used Western blot analyses to confirm that ER\u03b2 levels were increased after adding ER\u03b2-cDNA (oeER\u03b2) to A549 cells (Fig. 1A), and found that oeER\u03b2 promoted A549 cell invasion significantly (Fig. 1B). In contrast, ER\u03b2 levels were decreased after adding ER\u03b2-shRNA (shER\u03b2) to H1299 cells with high ER\u03b2 expression (Fig. 1C), and shER\u03b2 led to decrease significantly lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1D).Fig. 1ER\u03b2 promotes lung cancer cell invasion though circ-TMX4.A Western blot was used to verify ER\u03b2 protein expressions after oeER\u03b2 in A549. B Chamber-transwell invasion assays were performed using A549 cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 and pWPI, quantitation is at the right. The invaded cells were counted in five randomly chosen microscopic fields (\u00d7100) in each experiment and averaged for quantification. C Western blot was used to verify ER\u03b2 protein expressions after shER\u03b2 in H1299. D Chamber-transwell invasion assays were performed using H1299 cells transfected with shER\u03b2 and pLKO, quantitation is at the right. E, F qRT-PCR assay was used to check the top 16 increased circRNAs conducted by high-throughput sequencing in the oeER\u03b2 and pWPI(E), shER\u03b2 and pLKO(F). G Schematic illustration showing the position of the targeting shRNA to knock down the circRNAs (sh-circ) by targeting the specific splice junction. H Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after knocking down circ-0001130 or circ-0082894 in H1299 cells. I qRT-PCR assay was used to verify the effect of oecirc-TMX4. J, K Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after knocking down ER\u03b2 and oecirc-TMX4 in A549(J), oeER\u03b2 and shcirc-TMX4 in H1299(K). All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ns = not significant.\n        Using a microarray technique, Zhu X et al. evaluated the circRNA profiles of three paired lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) samples [24]. The results showed up-regulated circRNAs in LCa tissues compared to adjacent normal controls in patients with LAC. In this study, the top 16 circRNAs with significantly increased expression in lung cancer tissues were selected for further analysis. We performed qRT\u2013PCR assays to examine the impact of ER\u03b2 on the expression of these 16 circRNAs, and the results revealed that there were 2 circRNAs (hsa_circ_0001130, hsa_circ_0082894) whose expression were consistently altered by increasing or decreasing ER\u03b2 levels (Fig. 1E and F).\n        To further examine whether the 2 circRNAs regulate lung cancer cell invasion, we constructed shRNAs for these 2 circRNAs (sh-circRNA) by targeting specific splice junctions (Fig. 1G). We used qRT\u2013PCR to confirm the knock down efficacy in H1299 (Fig. S1B and C). The results from the transwell assays with matrigel-coated filters revealed that only knocking down hsa_circ_0001130 (circ-TMX4), but not hsa_circ_0082894, could suppress lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1H). Furthermore, we also increased the expression of this circRNA and confirmed the efficacy of overexpression in A549 cells (Fig. 1I). We found that over expressing circ-TMX4 could block shER\u03b2-suppressed cell invasion of lung cancer cell (Fig. 1J). Consistent with this, shcirc-TMX4 could also partly reverse ER\u03b2 mediated lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1K).\n        Together, the results from Fig. 1A\u2013K suggest that ER\u03b2 promotes lung cancer cell invasion through circ-TMX4.\n      \n      \n        Circ-TMX4 promotes lung cancer cell invasion\n        To further study the impact of ER\u03b2-altered circ-TMX4 on lung cancer cell invasion, we found that circ-TMX4 is derived from exon 2, 3, 4, 5 of TMX4 gene, and has a length of 337\u2009bp (Fig. 2A). To verify that exon2, 3, 4 and 5 of the TMX4 gene formed an endogenous circRNA, we applied qRT\u2013PCR with the divergent primers covering splice junction to detect circ-TMX4 (Fig. 2B), which is resistant to digestion by RNase-R. In contrast, GAPDH mRNA could be significantly decreased after RNase-R digestion (Fig. 2C and D). We also applied qRT\u2013PCR with the divergent primers without covered splice junction to detect both linear-TMX4 and circ-TMX4 (Fig. 2E). In order to demonstrate the specificity of the circ-TMX4 function, we also constructed a linear-formed TMX4 as well as the control vector using the pWPI plasmid (Fig. 2F), and validated their efficacy in A549 cells (Fig. 2G and H). Results from transwell assays confirmed that increasing circ-TMX4 expression increased A549 cell invasion more profoundly than linear-TMX4 sequence compared with the vector control group (Fig. 2I).Fig. 2Circ-TMX4 promotes lung cancer cell invasion.A The schematic diagram shows the genomic location and splicing patterns of circ-TMX4 (hsa_circ_0001130). B The schematic diagram shows the divergent primers covered splice junction to detect circ-TMX4. C, D The expression of circ-TMX4 and GAPDH mRNA in A549 and H1299 cells treated with or without RNase R was detected by qRT\u2013PCR. E, F The schematic diagram shows the divergent primers without covered splice junction to detect both linear-TMX4 and circ-TMX4. G, H qRT-PCR assay was used to verify the effect of oecirc-TMX4 and oelinear-TMX4. I Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after adding circ-TMX4 and linear-TMX4 in A549. J The expression of circ-TMX4 in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) and paratumor normal tissues (N) was detected by qRT\u2013PCR.

The results from qRT\u2013PCR assays indicated that circ-TMX4 was significantly elevated in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) compared to the paratumor normal tissues (N) from 36 patients (Fig. 2J).\n        Together, the results from Fig. 2A\u2013J suggest that circ-TMX4 increases lung cancer cell invasion.\n      \n      \n        ER\u03b2 regulates circ-TMX4 expression via transcriptional regulation\n        To dissect the molecular mechanism of how ER\u03b2 can regulate the circ-TMX4 expression at the transcriptional level, we relied upon the positive correlation between the host gene (TMX4) expression and its associated circRNA, and applied the Ensembl website (http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html) approaches to search for the potential EREs on the 3\u2009kb region of the host gene TMX4 promoter using JASPAR database, and found 4 putative EREs located within the TMX4 promoter region (Fig. 3A and B). We then applied the ChIP assay to verify their capacity of binding ER\u03b2 in H1299 cells, and results revealed that ER\u03b2 could bind to the ERE3/4 (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3ER\u03b2 regulates circ-TMX4 expression via transcriptional regulation.A, B 4 potential ER\u03b2 response elements (EREs) were predicted on the TMX4 3\u2009kb of the 5\u2032-promoter region. C Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) binding assay was performed on H1299. D The wild-type and mutant pGL3- TMX4 promoter reporter constructs. E, F Luciferase activity after transfection of wild-type or mutant circRNA-SMG1.72 promoter reporter construct in A549 (E) cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 or pWPI and in H1299 (F) cells transfected with shER\u03b2 or pLKO. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ns = not significant.\n        Then, to investigate whether ER\u03b2 can alter the expression of circ-TMX4 via binding to its host gene promoter, we constructed the TMX4 gene promoter luciferase reporter by inserting a 3\u2009kb 5\u2019 promoter region of TMX4 containing ERE3/4 into the pGL3 luciferase backbone as well as a mutant ERE3/4 (Fig. 3D). As expected, the luciferase assay results revealed that oeER\u03b2 significantly increased luciferase activity in A549 cells transfected with wild-type TMX4 promoter, but not in the cells with mutant TMX4 promoter (Fig. 3E). In contrast, shER\u03b2 significantly decreased luciferase activity in H1299 cells transfected with wild-type TMX4 promoter, but not in the cells with mutant TMX4 promoter (Fig. 3F).\n        Together, results from Fig. 3A\u2013F suggested that ER\u03b2 could increase circ-TMX4 expression via transcriptional regulation through binding to the ERE3/4 located in its host gene 5\u2032promoter region.\n      \n      \n        ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 signaling can increase lung cancer cell invasion through miR-622\n        As circRNAs may act as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate other RNA transcripts by competing for shared miRNAs [25], using analysis from databases (Circular RNA Interactome), we were able to identify top 12 potential candidate miRNAs with high scores. We then applied the RNA pull-down assay to test whether circ-TMX4 could interact with these candidate miRNAs using the biotinylated oligonucleotide (5\u2032-CCATGGGGCGTAACCATATC-3\u2032) to target the circular junction of circ-TMX4. Results revealed that 3 miRs (miR-1303, miR-622, miR-888) were enriched in the pull-down assay, suggesting the potential direct binding of the 3 miRs with circ-TMX4 (Fig. 4A). Yet, only miR-622 inhibitor could promote lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 4B), therefore we focused on the functional interaction between circ-TMX4 and miR-622. The results from the rescue assay in H1299 cells revealed that the oeER\u03b2-increased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially reversed via oemiR-622 (Fig. 4C), and shER\u03b2-decreased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially blocked via treating the A549 cells with the miR-622 inhibitor (antisense construct) (Fig. 4D). The results from the rescue assay in H1299 cells revealed that the oecirc-TMX4-increased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially reversed via oemiR-622 (Fig. S1D).Fig. 4Mechanism dissection of how ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 signaling can increase lung cancer cell invasion: via altering the miR-622 expression.A RNA pull-down assay was applied to test whether circ-TMX4 could interact with 12 potential candidate miRNAs using the biotinylated oligonucleotide to target the circular junction of circ-TMX4. B Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after using miR-1303 inhibitor, miR-622 inhibitor and miR-888 inhibitor. C, D Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity in H1299 (C) cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 or oemiR-622 and in A549 (D) cells transfected with shER\u03b2 or miR-622 inhibitor. E The expression of miR-622 in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) and paratumor normal tissues (N) was detected by qRT\u2013PCR. F The wild-type and mutant oecirc-TMX4 constructs. G Chamber-transwell invasion assays showed the efficiency of wild-type and mutant oecirc-TMX4 in H1299 cells. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ns = not significant.\n        We also examined the level of miRNA-622 in human clinical lung cancer samples. The results from qRT\u2013PCR assays indicated that miR-622 was significantly decreased in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) compared to paratumor normal tissues (N) from 36 patients (Fig. 4E).\n        To dissect the mechanism of how circ-TMX4 can act on miR-622, we identified the miR-622 binding sites located on the circ-TMX4 (Circular RNA Interactome), and then constructed a mutant circ-TMX4 (Fig. 4F) without the miRNA binding site. As expected, addition of mutant circ-TMX4 in H1299 cells failed to increase significantly lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 4G), suggesting that circ-TMX4 promoted lung cancer cell invasion via sponging and inhibition of miR-622.\n        We also collected the clinicopathological data of lung cancer patients who underwent surgery in our hospital in the past two years (2019-2020), and the analysis showed that tumor size, T grade, N grade and differentiation had significant correlations with circ-TMX4 and/or miR-622 expression (Table 1).Table 1Correlation between circ-TMX4/miR-622 expression and clinical pathologic characteristics.CharacteristicsCasecirc-TMX4pmiR-622plowhighlowhighAll cases12864646464Age (years)\u2009<607838400.71741370.469\u2009\u2265605026242327Gender\u2009Male7537380.85839360.590\u2009Female5327262528Smoking\u2009No4320230.57524190.349\u2009Yes8544414045Tumor size (cm)\u2009<3764828\n<0.001*34420.150\u2009\u226535216363022T grade\u2009T1\u2013T2855530\n<0.001*3352\n<0.001*\u2009T3\u2013T4439343112N grade\u2009N0-N1875829\n<0.001*3255\n<0.001*\u2009N2-N341635329Differentiation\u2009Well8045350.0682852\n<0.001*\u2009Moderate-Poor4819293612*Significant association.Bold values indicates statistically significant p\u2009<\u20090.05 values.\n        Together, results from Fig. 4A\u2013G and Table 1 suggest ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 axis may function via interacting/ altering miR-622 to impact the lung cancer cell invasion.\n      \n      \n        ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 axis promoted lung cancer cell invasion via altering CXCR4 expression\n        To further dissect how the ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 axis can enhance lung cancer cell invasion, we searched for metastasis genes that are linked to circ-TMX4 or miR-622 in the lung cancer cell databases (circBase, CircNet and OncoLnc). In brief, we used these websites to predict the candidate metastasis genes which may regulate lung cancer invasion. Based on different algorithms and criteria, each website could predict a panel of candidate metastasis genes with different matching scores. Among those panels of metastasis genes, we select 7 candidates which could be identified by 2 or more websites and with higher matching scores. We focused on the 7 metastasis-related genes, ROCK2, G3BP1, EYA1, PRKAR2B, APPL1, SRSF1 and CXCR4 to further test their expressions with qRT-PCR. Comparing the differential expressions of the genes in the 2 cell lines, the results revealed that CXCR4 had the differential change with oeER\u03b2 in A549 cells increasing the expression of G3BP1, PRKAR2B, CXCR4 (Fig. 5A) and shER\u03b2 in H1299 cells decreasing the expression of ROCK2 and CXCR4 (Fig. 5B), and western blot and invasion data also confirmed this relationship in 3 cell lines (Figs. 5C and D, S1E\u2212L), so we decided to focus on the CXCR4 to further study its linkage to the ER\u03b2, circ-TMX4 and miR-622.Fig. 5ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR\u2212622 axis promoted lung cancer cell invasion via altering CXCR4 expression.A, B The qRT-PCR assay for screening metastasis-associated genes in A549 cells with oeER\u03b2 compared with pWPI (A) and in H1299 cells with shER\u03b2 comparing with vector pLKO (B). C, D Western blot assay for CXCR4 expression in A549 cells with oeER\u03b2 or control (C) and in H1299 cells with knocked down ER\u03b2 or control (D). E\u2013H Western blot assays were performed to detect CXCR4 expression in 2 cell lines by manipulating ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 and ER\u03b2/miR-622. I, J Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity in A549 (I) cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 or shCXCR4 and in H1299 (J) cells transfected with shER\u03b2 or oeCXCR4.

N Lung cancer patients\u2019 data from TCGA show different expression of CXCR4 in normal (N) tissues and tumor (T) tissues. O Lung cancer patients\u2019 data from TCGA show the relationship between expression of CXCR4 and overall survival (OS) rates. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ns = not significant.\n        We confirmed that knocking down circ-TMX4 decreased the CXCR4 protein expression and could partly reverse the oeER\u03b2-promoted CXCR4 expression in H1299 cells (Fig. 5E), whereas in A549 cells, adding circ-TMX4 increased the CXCR4 protein expression and could effectively reverse the shER\u03b2-decreased CXCR4 expression (Fig. 5F). Importantly, we found that adding miR-622 in H1299 cells decreased the CXCR4 expression and effectively reversed the ER\u03b2-increased CXCR4 expression (Fig. 5G), while treating A549 cells with miR-622 inhibitor increased CXCR4 expression and partly reversed the ER\u03b2-shRNA-suppressed CXCR4 expression (Fig. 5H). We also treated H1299 cells with oecirc-TMX4 and AMD3100 (CXCR4 Antagonist), A549 cell with shcirc-TMX4 and CXCL12 (SDF-1\u03b1, CXCR4 Ligands), then detected functional CXCR4 expression by Fluorescence activated Cell Sorting (FACS). We found that AMD3100 decreased the functional CXCR4 expression and could reverse the oecirc-TMX4-promoted CXCR4 expression in H1299 cells (Fig. S2A), whereas in A549 cells, CXCL12 increased the functional CXCR4 expression and could effectively reverse the shcirc-TMX4-decreased CXCR4 expression (Fig. S2B).\n        Next, to examine the consequences after suppressing the CXCR4 expression in lung cancer cells, we applied the interruption approach using CXCR4-shRNA. The rescue experiments via Chamber-transwell invasion assay results revealed that CXCR4 knockdown by shRNA could effectively reduce the ER\u03b2-enhanced lung cancer cell invasion in A549 cells (Fig. 5I), and shER\u03b2-decreased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially blocked via treating the H1299 cells with oeCXCR4 (Fig. 5J).\n        For mechanism dissection of how miR-622 can modulate CXCR4 expression at the molecular level, we identified the potential binding site located on the 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/). We then applied the reporter assay with the psiCHECK2 vector carrying the wild-type (WT) miRNA-target sites and mutant without miRNA-target sites (Fig. 5K), and results revealed that miR-622 could decrease the luciferase reporter activity of wild-type 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4, with little effect on the mutant 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA in H1299 cells (Fig. 5L). In contrast, miR-622 inhibitor significantly increased luciferase activity in A549 cells transfected with wild-type 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4, but not in the cells with mutant 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA (Fig. 5M), suggesting that miR-622 could directly target the 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA to suppress the protein expression.\n        Based on TCGA database, the data from human clinical sample surveys showed a general trend that CXCR4 was increased in lung cancer tumor tissues compared to paratumor normal tissues (Fig. 5N) while patients with lower CXCR4 expression tended to have better overall survival in the first 100 months after diagnosis of lung cancer (Fig. 5O), although a statistical significance was not reached (p\u2009=\u20090.2).\n        Together, results from Fig. 5A\u2013O suggest that ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 axis enhanced lung cancer cell invasion via altering the CXCR4 expression.\n      \n      \n        Preclinical study using the in vivo mouse model to demonstrate the role of ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622/CXCR4 signaling in the lung cancer progression\n        To test whether the mechanisms that we uncovered in vitro similarly play a significant role in vivo, we injected 1\u00d7106 H1299-Luc cells into the left lateral thorax of nude mice in situ in the xenografted mouse model. The mice were divided into three groups: 1)pWPI+pLKO; 2)oe ER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009pLKO; 3)oeER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009shcirc-TMX4. Tumor development and metastasis were monitored by non-invasive In Vivo Fluorescent Imager (IVIS Spectrum, Caliper Life Sciences) once a week. Mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks, tumors and any metastases were removed for studies. The results showed that the addition of ER\u03b2 could promote lung cancer metastasis, and shcirc-TMX4 could block ER\u03b2 mediated progression of lung cancer (Fig. 6A). We then sacrificed the mice and counted the number of metastatic foci, and the results also consistent with the IVIS signal (Fig. 6B and C). We have determined the expression of miR-622 in in vivo xenograft tumors harvested from mice. The results showed that neither oeER\u03b2 nor shcirc-TMX4 can change miR-622 expression significantly (Fig. S2C). IHC data also confirmed that shcirc-TMX4 could also reduce CXCR4 expression mediated by ER\u03b2 (Fig. 6D). We also confirmed the signaling in A549 -Luc cells with 3 groups: (1) pWPI+Ctrl; (2) oeER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009Ctrl; (3) oeER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009oemiR-622. We treated the mice as above, and the result showed that oemiR-622 could block ER\u03b2 mediated progression of lung cancer (Fig. S2D\u2013F).Fig. 6Preclinical study using the in vivo mouse model to demonstrate the role of ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR\u2212622/CXCR4 signaling in the lung cancer progression.A IVIS imaging was used to detect the various distal metastasis foci in mice. B Quantification of the mice with metastasis. C Quantification of the total metastatic foci. D IHC assay was used to check CXCR4 expression in mice tumor tissues in each group. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.\n        Together, the results from our preclinical study using in vivo mouse model in Fig. 6A\u2013D prove that ER\u03b2 may play an important role to promote the liver cancer metastasis via altering the circ-TMX4/CXCR4 signaling axis.\nER\u03b2 promotes lung cancer cell invasion through circ-TMX4\n        While results from recent studies indicated that ER\u03b2 can promote lung cancer cell invasion [7], its linkage to circRNA expression for altering lung cancer progression remains unclear. We had applied Western blot assay for ER\u03b2 expression in 5 human LCa cell lines (H292, H1299, A549, H358 and H157) (Fig. S1A), and selected H1299 cell line with highest ER\u03b2 expression for knock down, and A549 cell line with lower ER\u03b2 expression for over expression. We first altered ER\u03b2 expression and used Western blot analyses to confirm that ER\u03b2 levels were increased after adding ER\u03b2-cDNA (oeER\u03b2) to A549 cells (Fig. 1A), and found that oeER\u03b2 promoted A549 cell invasion significantly (Fig. 1B). In contrast, ER\u03b2 levels were decreased after adding ER\u03b2-shRNA (shER\u03b2) to H1299 cells with high ER\u03b2 expression (Fig. 1C), and shER\u03b2 led to decrease significantly lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1D).Fig. 1ER\u03b2 promotes lung cancer cell invasion though circ-TMX4.A Western blot was used to verify ER\u03b2 protein expressions after oeER\u03b2 in A549. B Chamber-transwell invasion assays were performed using A549 cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 and pWPI, quantitation is at the right. The invaded cells were counted in five randomly chosen microscopic fields (\u00d7100) in each experiment and averaged for quantification. C Western blot was used to verify ER\u03b2 protein expressions after shER\u03b2 in H1299. D Chamber-transwell invasion assays were performed using H1299 cells transfected with shER\u03b2 and pLKO, quantitation is at the right.

G Schematic illustration showing the position of the targeting shRNA to knock down the circRNAs (sh-circ) by targeting the specific splice junction. H Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after knocking down circ-0001130 or circ-0082894 in H1299 cells. I qRT-PCR assay was used to verify the effect of oecirc-TMX4. J, K Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after knocking down ER\u03b2 and oecirc-TMX4 in A549(J), oeER\u03b2 and shcirc-TMX4 in H1299(K). All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ns = not significant.\n        Using a microarray technique, Zhu X et al. evaluated the circRNA profiles of three paired lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) samples [24]. The results showed up-regulated circRNAs in LCa tissues compared to adjacent normal controls in patients with LAC. In this study, the top 16 circRNAs with significantly increased expression in lung cancer tissues were selected for further analysis. We performed qRT\u2013PCR assays to examine the impact of ER\u03b2 on the expression of these 16 circRNAs, and the results revealed that there were 2 circRNAs (hsa_circ_0001130, hsa_circ_0082894) whose expression were consistently altered by increasing or decreasing ER\u03b2 levels (Fig. 1E and F).\n        To further examine whether the 2 circRNAs regulate lung cancer cell invasion, we constructed shRNAs for these 2 circRNAs (sh-circRNA) by targeting specific splice junctions (Fig. 1G). We used qRT\u2013PCR to confirm the knock down efficacy in H1299 (Fig. S1B and C). The results from the transwell assays with matrigel-coated filters revealed that only knocking down hsa_circ_0001130 (circ-TMX4), but not hsa_circ_0082894, could suppress lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1H). Furthermore, we also increased the expression of this circRNA and confirmed the efficacy of overexpression in A549 cells (Fig. 1I). We found that over expressing circ-TMX4 could block shER\u03b2-suppressed cell invasion of lung cancer cell (Fig. 1J). Consistent with this, shcirc-TMX4 could also partly reverse ER\u03b2 mediated lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1K).\n        Together, the results from Fig. 1A\u2013K suggest that ER\u03b2 promotes lung cancer cell invasion through circ-TMX4.\nCirc-TMX4 promotes lung cancer cell invasion\n        To further study the impact of ER\u03b2-altered circ-TMX4 on lung cancer cell invasion, we found that circ-TMX4 is derived from exon 2, 3, 4, 5 of TMX4 gene, and has a length of 337\u2009bp (Fig. 2A). To verify that exon2, 3, 4 and 5 of the TMX4 gene formed an endogenous circRNA, we applied qRT\u2013PCR with the divergent primers covering splice junction to detect circ-TMX4 (Fig. 2B), which is resistant to digestion by RNase-R. In contrast, GAPDH mRNA could be significantly decreased after RNase-R digestion (Fig. 2C and D). We also applied qRT\u2013PCR with the divergent primers without covered splice junction to detect both linear-TMX4 and circ-TMX4 (Fig. 2E). In order to demonstrate the specificity of the circ-TMX4 function, we also constructed a linear-formed TMX4 as well as the control vector using the pWPI plasmid (Fig. 2F), and validated their efficacy in A549 cells (Fig. 2G and H). Results from transwell assays confirmed that increasing circ-TMX4 expression increased A549 cell invasion more profoundly than linear-TMX4 sequence compared with the vector control group (Fig. 2I).Fig. 2Circ-TMX4 promotes lung cancer cell invasion.A The schematic diagram shows the genomic location and splicing patterns of circ-TMX4 (hsa_circ_0001130). B The schematic diagram shows the divergent primers covered splice junction to detect circ-TMX4. C, D The expression of circ-TMX4 and GAPDH mRNA in A549 and H1299 cells treated with or without RNase R was detected by qRT\u2013PCR. E, F The schematic diagram shows the divergent primers without covered splice junction to detect both linear-TMX4 and circ-TMX4. G, H qRT-PCR assay was used to verify the effect of oecirc-TMX4 and oelinear-TMX4. I Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after adding circ-TMX4 and linear-TMX4 in A549. J The expression of circ-TMX4 in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) and paratumor normal tissues (N) was detected by qRT\u2013PCR. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ns = not significant.\n        To strengthen the above in vitro cell line data, we also studied human clinical lung cancer samples. The results from qRT\u2013PCR assays indicated that circ-TMX4 was significantly elevated in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) compared to the paratumor normal tissues (N) from 36 patients (Fig. 2J).\n        Together, the results from Fig. 2A\u2013J suggest that circ-TMX4 increases lung cancer cell invasion.\nER\u03b2 regulates circ-TMX4 expression via transcriptional regulation\n        To dissect the molecular mechanism of how ER\u03b2 can regulate the circ-TMX4 expression at the transcriptional level, we relied upon the positive correlation between the host gene (TMX4) expression and its associated circRNA, and applied the Ensembl website (http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html) approaches to search for the potential EREs on the 3\u2009kb region of the host gene TMX4 promoter using JASPAR database, and found 4 putative EREs located within the TMX4 promoter region (Fig. 3A and B). We then applied the ChIP assay to verify their capacity of binding ER\u03b2 in H1299 cells, and results revealed that ER\u03b2 could bind to the ERE3/4 (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3ER\u03b2 regulates circ-TMX4 expression via transcriptional regulation.A, B 4 potential ER\u03b2 response elements (EREs) were predicted on the TMX4 3\u2009kb of the 5\u2032-promoter region. C Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) binding assay was performed on H1299. D The wild-type and mutant pGL3- TMX4 promoter reporter constructs. E, F Luciferase activity after transfection of wild-type or mutant circRNA-SMG1.72 promoter reporter construct in A549 (E) cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 or pWPI and in H1299 (F) cells transfected with shER\u03b2 or pLKO. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ns = not significant.\n        Then, to investigate whether ER\u03b2 can alter the expression of circ-TMX4 via binding to its host gene promoter, we constructed the TMX4 gene promoter luciferase reporter by inserting a 3\u2009kb 5\u2019 promoter region of TMX4 containing ERE3/4 into the pGL3 luciferase backbone as well as a mutant ERE3/4 (Fig. 3D). As expected, the luciferase assay results revealed that oeER\u03b2 significantly increased luciferase activity in A549 cells transfected with wild-type TMX4 promoter, but not in the cells with mutant TMX4 promoter (Fig. 3E). In contrast, shER\u03b2 significantly decreased luciferase activity in H1299 cells transfected with wild-type TMX4 promoter, but not in the cells with mutant TMX4 promoter (Fig. 3F).\n        Together, results from Fig. 3A\u2013F suggested that ER\u03b2 could increase circ-TMX4 expression via transcriptional regulation through binding to the ERE3/4 located in its host gene 5\u2032promoter region.\nER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 signaling can increase lung cancer cell invasion through miR-622\n        As circRNAs may act as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate other RNA transcripts by competing for shared miRNAs [25], using analysis from databases (Circular RNA Interactome), we were able to identify top 12 potential candidate miRNAs with high scores. We then applied the RNA pull-down assay to test whether circ-TMX4 could interact with these candidate miRNAs using the biotinylated oligonucleotide (5\u2032-CCATGGGGCGTAACCATATC-3\u2032) to target the circular junction of circ-TMX4. Results revealed that 3 miRs (miR-1303, miR-622, miR-888) were enriched in the pull-down assay, suggesting the potential direct binding of the 3 miRs with circ-TMX4 (Fig. 4A). Yet, only miR-622 inhibitor could promote lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 4B), therefore we focused on the functional interaction between circ-TMX4 and miR-622. The results from the rescue assay in H1299 cells revealed that the oeER\u03b2-increased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially reversed via oemiR-622 (Fig. 4C), and shER\u03b2-decreased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially blocked via treating the A549 cells with the miR-622 inhibitor (antisense construct) (Fig. 4D). The results from the rescue assay in H1299 cells revealed that the oecirc-TMX4-increased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially reversed via oemiR-622 (Fig. S1D).Fig. 4Mechanism dissection of how ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 signaling can increase lung cancer cell invasion: via altering the miR-622 expression.A RNA pull-down assay was applied to test whether circ-TMX4 could interact with 12 potential candidate miRNAs using the biotinylated oligonucleotide to target the circular junction of circ-TMX4. B Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity after using miR-1303 inhibitor, miR-622 inhibitor and miR-888 inhibitor. C, D Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity in H1299 (C) cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 or oemiR-622 and in A549 (D) cells transfected with shER\u03b2 or miR-622 inhibitor. E The expression of miR-622 in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) and paratumor normal tissues (N) was detected by qRT\u2013PCR. F The wild-type and mutant oecirc-TMX4 constructs. G Chamber-transwell invasion assays showed the efficiency of wild-type and mutant oecirc-TMX4 in H1299 cells. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ns = not significant.\n        We also examined the level of miRNA-622 in human clinical lung cancer samples. The results from qRT\u2013PCR assays indicated that miR-622 was significantly decreased in fresh lung cancer tumor tissues (T) compared to paratumor normal tissues (N) from 36 patients (Fig. 4E).\n        To dissect the mechanism of how circ-TMX4 can act on miR-622, we identified the miR-622 binding sites located on the circ-TMX4 (Circular RNA Interactome), and then constructed a mutant circ-TMX4 (Fig. 4F) without the miRNA binding site. As expected, addition of mutant circ-TMX4 in H1299 cells failed to increase significantly lung cancer cell invasion (Fig. 4G), suggesting that circ-TMX4 promoted lung cancer cell invasion via sponging and inhibition of miR-622.\n        We also collected the clinicopathological data of lung cancer patients who underwent surgery in our hospital in the past two years (2019-2020), and the analysis showed that tumor size, T grade, N grade and differentiation had significant correlations with circ-TMX4 and/or miR-622 expression (Table 1).Table 1Correlation between circ-TMX4/miR-622 expression and clinical pathologic characteristics.CharacteristicsCasecirc-TMX4pmiR-622plowhighlowhighAll cases12864646464Age (years)\u2009<607838400.71741370.469\u2009\u2265605026242327Gender\u2009Male7537380.85839360.590\u2009Female5327262528Smoking\u2009No4320230.57524190.349\u2009Yes8544414045Tumor size (cm)\u2009<3764828\n<0.001*34420.150\u2009\u226535216363022T grade\u2009T1\u2013T2855530\n<0.001*3352\n<0.001*\u2009T3\u2013T4439343112N grade\u2009N0-N1875829\n<0.001*3255\n<0.001*\u2009N2-N341635329Differentiation\u2009Well8045350.0682852\n<0.001*\u2009Moderate-Poor4819293612*Significant association.Bold values indicates statistically significant p\u2009<\u20090.05 values.\n        Together, results from Fig. 4A\u2013G and Table 1 suggest ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4 axis may function via interacting/ altering miR-622 to impact the lung cancer cell invasion.\nER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 axis promoted lung cancer cell invasion via altering CXCR4 expression\n        To further dissect how the ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 axis can enhance lung cancer cell invasion, we searched for metastasis genes that are linked to circ-TMX4 or miR-622 in the lung cancer cell databases (circBase, CircNet and OncoLnc). In brief, we used these websites to predict the candidate metastasis genes which may regulate lung cancer invasion. Based on different algorithms and criteria, each website could predict a panel of candidate metastasis genes with different matching scores. Among those panels of metastasis genes, we select 7 candidates which could be identified by 2 or more websites and with higher matching scores. We focused on the 7 metastasis-related genes, ROCK2, G3BP1, EYA1, PRKAR2B, APPL1, SRSF1 and CXCR4 to further test their expressions with qRT-PCR. Comparing the differential expressions of the genes in the 2 cell lines, the results revealed that CXCR4 had the differential change with oeER\u03b2 in A549 cells increasing the expression of G3BP1, PRKAR2B, CXCR4 (Fig. 5A) and shER\u03b2 in H1299 cells decreasing the expression of ROCK2 and CXCR4 (Fig. 5B), and western blot and invasion data also confirmed this relationship in 3 cell lines (Figs. 5C and D, S1E\u2212L), so we decided to focus on the CXCR4 to further study its linkage to the ER\u03b2, circ-TMX4 and miR-622.Fig. 5ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR\u2212622 axis promoted lung cancer cell invasion via altering CXCR4 expression.A, B The qRT-PCR assay for screening metastasis-associated genes in A549 cells with oeER\u03b2 compared with pWPI (A) and in H1299 cells with shER\u03b2 comparing with vector pLKO (B).

I, J Chamber-transwell invasion assay was used to check the invasion capacity in A549 (I) cells transfected with oeER\u03b2 or shCXCR4 and in H1299 (J) cells transfected with shER\u03b2 or oeCXCR4.

N Lung cancer patients\u2019 data from TCGA show different expression of CXCR4 in normal (N) tissues and tumor (T) tissues. O Lung cancer patients\u2019 data from TCGA show the relationship between expression of CXCR4 and overall survival (OS) rates. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ns = not significant.\n        We confirmed that knocking down circ-TMX4 decreased the CXCR4 protein expression and could partly reverse the oeER\u03b2-promoted CXCR4 expression in H1299 cells (Fig. 5E), whereas in A549 cells, adding circ-TMX4 increased the CXCR4 protein expression and could effectively reverse the shER\u03b2-decreased CXCR4 expression (Fig. 5F). Importantly, we found that adding miR-622 in H1299 cells decreased the CXCR4 expression and effectively reversed the ER\u03b2-increased CXCR4 expression (Fig. 5G), while treating A549 cells with miR-622 inhibitor increased CXCR4 expression and partly reversed the ER\u03b2-shRNA-suppressed CXCR4 expression (Fig. 5H). We also treated H1299 cells with oecirc-TMX4 and AMD3100 (CXCR4 Antagonist), A549 cell with shcirc-TMX4 and CXCL12 (SDF-1\u03b1, CXCR4 Ligands), then detected functional CXCR4 expression by Fluorescence activated Cell Sorting (FACS). We found that AMD3100 decreased the functional CXCR4 expression and could reverse the oecirc-TMX4-promoted CXCR4 expression in H1299 cells (Fig. S2A), whereas in A549 cells, CXCL12 increased the functional CXCR4 expression and could effectively reverse the shcirc-TMX4-decreased CXCR4 expression (Fig. S2B).\n        Next, to examine the consequences after suppressing the CXCR4 expression in lung cancer cells, we applied the interruption approach using CXCR4-shRNA. The rescue experiments via Chamber-transwell invasion assay results revealed that CXCR4 knockdown by shRNA could effectively reduce the ER\u03b2-enhanced lung cancer cell invasion in A549 cells (Fig. 5I), and shER\u03b2-decreased lung cancer cell invasion could be partially blocked via treating the H1299 cells with oeCXCR4 (Fig. 5J).\n        For mechanism dissection of how miR-622 can modulate CXCR4 expression at the molecular level, we identified the potential binding site located on the 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/). We then applied the reporter assay with the psiCHECK2 vector carrying the wild-type (WT) miRNA-target sites and mutant without miRNA-target sites (Fig. 5K), and results revealed that miR-622 could decrease the luciferase reporter activity of wild-type 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4, with little effect on the mutant 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA in H1299 cells (Fig. 5L). In contrast, miR-622 inhibitor significantly increased luciferase activity in A549 cells transfected with wild-type 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4, but not in the cells with mutant 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA (Fig. 5M), suggesting that miR-622 could directly target the 3\u2019UTR of CXCR4-mRNA to suppress the protein expression.\n        Based on TCGA database, the data from human clinical sample surveys showed a general trend that CXCR4 was increased in lung cancer tumor tissues compared to paratumor normal tissues (Fig. 5N) while patients with lower CXCR4 expression tended to have better overall survival in the first 100 months after diagnosis of lung cancer (Fig. 5O), although a statistical significance was not reached (p\u2009=\u20090.2).\n        Together, results from Fig. 5A\u2013O suggest that ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 axis enhanced lung cancer cell invasion via altering the CXCR4 expression.\nPreclinical study using the in vivo mouse model to demonstrate the role of ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622/CXCR4 signaling in the lung cancer progression\n        To test whether the mechanisms that we uncovered in vitro similarly play a significant role in vivo, we injected 1\u00d7106 H1299-Luc cells into the left lateral thorax of nude mice in situ in the xenografted mouse model. The mice were divided into three groups: 1)pWPI+pLKO; 2)oe ER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009pLKO; 3)oeER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009shcirc-TMX4. Tumor development and metastasis were monitored by non-invasive In Vivo Fluorescent Imager (IVIS Spectrum, Caliper Life Sciences) once a week. Mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks, tumors and any metastases were removed for studies. The results showed that the addition of ER\u03b2 could promote lung cancer metastasis, and shcirc-TMX4 could block ER\u03b2 mediated progression of lung cancer (Fig. 6A). We then sacrificed the mice and counted the number of metastatic foci, and the results also consistent with the IVIS signal (Fig. 6B and C). We have determined the expression of miR-622 in in vivo xenograft tumors harvested from mice. The results showed that neither oeER\u03b2 nor shcirc-TMX4 can change miR-622 expression significantly (Fig. S2C). IHC data also confirmed that shcirc-TMX4 could also reduce CXCR4 expression mediated by ER\u03b2 (Fig. 6D). We also confirmed the signaling in A549 -Luc cells with 3 groups: (1) pWPI+Ctrl; (2) oeER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009Ctrl; (3) oeER\u03b2\u2009+\u2009oemiR-622. We treated the mice as above, and the result showed that oemiR-622 could block ER\u03b2 mediated progression of lung cancer (Fig. S2D\u2013F).Fig. 6Preclinical study using the in vivo mouse model to demonstrate the role of ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR\u2212622/CXCR4 signaling in the lung cancer progression.A IVIS imaging was used to detect the various distal metastasis foci in mice. B Quantification of the mice with metastasis. C Quantification of the total metastatic foci. D IHC assay was used to check CXCR4 expression in mice tumor tissues in each group. All quantitations are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and p values calculated by t-test, *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.\n        Together, the results from our preclinical study using in vivo mouse model in Fig. 6A\u2013D prove that ER\u03b2 may play an important role to promote the liver cancer metastasis via altering the circ-TMX4/CXCR4 signaling axis.\nDiscussion\n      In the present study, we demonstrated that ER\u03b2 could promote NSCLC cell invasion via increasing the circular RNA (circRNA), circ-TMX4, expression via direct binding to the 5\u2019 promoter region of its host gene TMX4. ER\u03b2-promoted circ-TMX4 could then sponge miR-622 and inhibit its function, which can then result in increasing the CXCR4 messenger RNA translation via a reduced miR binding to its 3\u2019UTR.\n      There have been several reports on the roles of ER\u03b2 in NSCLC progression [7, 26\u201329]. While the majority of clinical evidence pointed to a tumor-promoting role of ER\u03b2 [7, 26, 27], ER\u03b2 was also reported to have a protecting effect for cancer progression [30]. A study found that hormone replacement therapy had a strong negative effect on survival after diagnosis of lung cancer [31]. How ER\u03b2 affects the progression of NSCLC remains controversial [32\u201334]. Some research revealed ER\u03b2 expression is a cancer-promoting gene while others not. On the other hand, estrogen has been proved to be important factors in promoting the progression of NSCLC through enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [35].\n      In our study, we found that circRNAs are important regulatory molecules in lung cancer progression. ER\u03b2 could promote NSCLC cell invasion via increasing circ-TMX4 expression because ER\u03b2 could directly bind to the 5\u2019 promoter region of its host gene TMX4. A large number of studies have found that non-coding RNA (ncRNA) plays an important role in the occurrence and development of NSCLC [7, 36, 37], of which circular RNA (circRNA) is one of the current active research areas. More and more studies have found that circRNAs can regulate different functions through interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) [38\u201340]. Sang et al. reported that circRNA_0025202 could regulate breast cancer tamoxifen sensitivity and tumor progression via regulating the miR-182-5p/FOXO3a axis [41]. Zeng et al. showed that CircHIPK3 could promote colorectal cancer growth and metastasis by sponging miR-7 [42]. Our study has shown that circ-TMX4 could suppress the function of miR-622 via sponging it but not changing its expression level.\n      MiRNAs plays an important role in the development of tumors [13, 43\u201346]. miRNAs have been shown to negatively mediate the expression of their target genes by inducing mRNA degradation or inhibiting protein translation mainly through binding with 3\u2019UTR [47, 48]. Our result showed that miR-622 can decrease the CXCR4 messenger RNA translation via a reduced miRNA binding to its 3\u2019UTR. Conversely overexpressing miR-622 or adding miR-622 inhibitor also confirmed the validity of this signaling. In our study, the data showed the reverse function was partial, suggesting that sponging miR-622 is only one of the signaling pathway engaged by ER\u03b2-circ-TMX4 for lung cancer progression, others mechanisms remain to be determined.\n      Our analysis of the online TCGA database on NSCLC samples shows significant tumor-promoting effects of CXCR4. Many NSCLC cell lines express high levels of CXCR4, and SDF-1-activated CXCR4 promotes in vitro migration and invasion of these cell lines [49]. In vivo experiments confirmed that blocking the CXCR4/SDF-1 pathway can inhibit NSCLC cell metastasis [50]. Some retrospective studies have reported the relationship between the expression of CXCR4 in NSCLC and clinical prognosis [51, 52], suggesting that the CXCR4/SDF-1 pathway plays an important role in NSCLC. Since NSCLC is a group of malignant tumors with wide heterogeneity, the prognosis may be different according to different subtypes. Indeed it was found that CXCR4 is highly expressed in many specimens of lung adenosquamous carcinoma. In addition, the high expression of CXCR4 is often associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis [53]. Our study also proved that CXCR4 was an oncogene under the regulation of ER\u03b2/circ-TMX4/miR-622 signaling to promote lung cancer progression, thus our work established the foundation to target this signaling for developing new drugs for the better treatment of lung cancer.\nSupplementary information\n      The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41419-022-04514-4.",
