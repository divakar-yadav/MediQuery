    "abstract": "The skeleton is a frequent target of lung cancer metastasis, and approximately 30% to 40% of patients with advanced lung cancer develop bone metastasis, which explains the high mortality rates and poor quality of life.4, 5 Osteolytic metastasis is associated with enhanced osteoclast activity.6 Receptor activator of NF\u2010kB ligand (RANKL) signaling is essential for the terminal differentiation of monocytes/macrophages into osteoclasts.7 Increased RANKL expression in the tumoral bone environment can increase osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity, resulting in bone metastasis.8 In our previous study, a group of organ\u2010specific metastatic cell lines which only metastasize to the spinal column, lung, brain, and mediastinal lymph node were successfully established from the parent lung cancer cell line L9981\u2010Luc.9 The four cell lines were: L9981\u2010BoM, L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010BrM and L9981\u2010LnM, respectively.9 Compared to the parent cell line (L9981\u2010Luc), the morphology and biological behavior of the four organ\u2010specific metastatic cells changed significantly.9 Given this, it will be helpful to provide reliable cell model for further studying the molecular mechanisms and signal regulation of organ\u2010specific metastasis in lung cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small, non\u2010coding RNAs, approximately 19\u201325 nucleotides long.10 They modulate the expression of target genes by interacting with the 3' untranslated regions (3'\u2010UTRs) of target mRNA and play an essential role in the biological and pathological processes of various diseases.11, 12 Many studies have also indicated that microRNAs can modulate tumor initiation and progression and function in tumor cell invasion and metastasis.13, 14, 15, 16 Studies have shown that miR\u2010660\u20105p regulates the malignancy of breast cancer cells by suppressing the expression of TFCP2, and is a novel therapeutic target for clinical treatment and a potential prognostic indicator.17, 18 Moreover, miR\u2010660\u20105p acts as a tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma and may regulate cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis.19 However, the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p in the pathogenesis of lung cancer remains unknown. The SMARCA5 (SWI/SNF\u2010related, matrix\u2010associated, actin\u2010dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 5) belongs to the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers which have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of specific genes by altering the chromatin structure around them.20, 21 The chromosome location that determined for the SMARCA5 gene, 4q31, is within a region where loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinomas.22, 23 Furthermore, studies indicate that SMARCA5 expression is dysregulated in many human malignant tumors, such as gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and acute leukemia.24, 25, 26, 27 Also, SMARCA5 gene is a target of miRNA regulation.28, 29 However, the association between SMARCA5 expression and the formation, progression, and metastasis of lung cancer cells remains unclear.",

    "description": "Background\n          Nm23\u2010H1 gene has been found to be an inhibitor of tumor metastasis in lung cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in tumor metastasis through multiple signaling pathways. This study explored whether the nm23\u2010H1 gene could inhibit invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells by regulating miRNA\u2010660\u20105p targets.\nMethods\n      \n        Cell lines and cell culture\n        The subcell lines (high\u2010metastatic L9981 and low\u2010metastatic NL9980) were isolated from a human lung large cell carcinoma cell line and established.37 A group of organ\u2010specific metastatic cell lines: L9981\u2010BoM, L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010BrM, and L9981\u2010LnM were established from the parent lung cancer cell line L9981\u2010Luc.9 The cell lines with stable nm23\u2010H1 gene silencing (ie, NL9980\u201099 and A549\u201099) were established from NL9980 and A549 cell lines.38 The A549 cell line was procured from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in RPMI\u20101640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 1% penicillin\u2010streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C, in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.\n      \n      \n        Quantitative real\u2010time PCR\n        Quantitative RT\u2010PCR was performed to validate the miRNA and mRNA expression levels using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan). The PCR was performed in triplicate and analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900HT fast real\u2010time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA). The relative quantification values for each gene were calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method using U6 or GAPDH as an internal reference. The primer for miR\u2010660\u20105p was a specific miRNA primer (Hsa\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p; Ruibobio, Guangzhou, China). The other primers in this study are shown in Table S1.\n      \n      \n        Cell transfection\n        To study miR\u2010660\u20105p gene regulation, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were seeded into six\u2010well plates and cultured for 24\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C before transfection. A total of 200\u2009pmol of synthesized miR\u2010660\u20105p mimic or inhibitor (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) were transfected into L9981\u2010Luc or L9981\u2010BoM cell lines (once the cells had reached 60%\u201380% confluence) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same quantities of mimic or inhibitor were used as negative controls (NCs; GenePharma, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, transfection efficiency was verified by RT\u2010qPCR.\n      \n      \n        Cell migration assays\n        To conduct a wound\u2010healing migration assay, the cells were seeded onto 35\u2009mm dishes coated with fibronectin. Once the cells had reached 100% confluence, a scratch (approximately 500\u2009\u03bcm long) was created on the confluent monolayer using a sterile p200 pipette tip. The cell debris was then removed by replacing the medium with fresh serum\u2010free medium. During the subsequent 48\u2009hours culture of the cells, the width of the wound was measured at 0 hours, 24\u2009hours, and 48\u2009hours time points. Three to four different locations were visualized and photographed under a phase\u2010contrast inverted microscope. Images were taken in 40x field of vision.\n      \n      \n        Cell invasion assays\n        A Matrigel transwell chamber (BD), filled with the serum\u2010free medium, was used for the invasion assay. A total of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were loaded into the upper chamber. Medium containing 20% FBS was used as the chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 24\u2009hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells that had adhered to the lower membrane were fixed, stained, and counted using a microscope and a counting chamber (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Photos were taken in 100x field of vision.\n      \n      \n        Cell proliferation assay\n        Cell Counting Kit\u20108 (CCK\u20108) assay was used to analyze cell proliferation. Cells were seeded in 96 well plated at 5.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/mL and cultured for 24\u2009hours, 48\u2009hours, and 72\u2009hours durations. At the end of each time point, the cells were stained with 10\u2009\u03bcL of CCK\u20108 solution (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) then incubated for 3\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C. Each absorbance was measured at 450\u2009nm (A450) using a spectrophotometer. Each sample was run in triplicate.\n      \n      \n        Generation of stable miR\u2010660\u20105p and nm23\u2010H1 overexpressing cells\n        Experiments were performed using lentiviral vector (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) to obtain stable miR\u2010660\u20105p and nm23\u2010H1 overexpressing cells. Lung cancer cells were seeded at 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cell density in each 24 well plate and infected with miR\u2010660\u20105p/nm23\u2010H1/control lentiviral vector at multiplicity of infection of 10 (10 infectious units for each target cells). After 72\u2009hours of infection, cells were selected with Puromycin, and mRNA overexpression was quantified on day 10 or 30 after infection. A group of stable miR\u2010660\u20105p or nm23\u2010H1 overexpressing cells labelled L9981\u2010Luc\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p, L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1, and L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p were established.\n      \n      \n        In vivo assay\n        For in vivo metastasis assays, the stable cell lines L9981\u2010Luc\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p, L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1, and L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p and control cell lines L9981\u2010luc\u2010Lv\u2010NC and L9981\u2010BoM\u2010Lv\u2010NC were collected and suspended in 0.2 mL PBS for each mouse (five mice in each group, 6\u20138\u2009weeks old), and the cells were injected into the left side of the posterior flank of the nude mice. A total of 30 minutes after cell injection, luciferase substrate was injected at a dose of 150\u2009mg/kg, and live images of the mice were obtained using an IVIS200 (Xenogene, USA). These initial data were regarded as those for Day 0. Luciferase activity was measured every seven\u2009days using the same protocol. Tumor growth was measured periodically. Image\u2010Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity. Bone metastasis rate was evaluated according to the number of spinal column metastases in each group.\n      \n      \n        Dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay\n        The full\u2010length 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of SMARCA5 amplified from human genomic DNA was cloned into the downstream of the firefly luciferase coding region of pMIR\u2010GLOTM Luciferase vector (Promega, USA). The recombined vector was denoted as pMIR\u2010SMARCA5. Mutations of miR\u2010660\u20105p binding sites were introduced by site\u2010directed mutagenesis, and the resulting vector was denoted as pMIR\u2010SMARCA5\u2010Mut. Cells were seeded into 24 well plates and cotransfected with 200\u2009ng of pMIR\u2010SMARCA or pMIR\u2010SMARCA\u2010Mut vectors and 100\u2009ng of miR\u2010660\u20105p mimic or mimic control. The pRL\u2010TK plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for internal normalization. After 48\u2009hours, cells were lysed using the lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted using the Dual\u2010Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed at least three times.\n      \n      \n        Western blotting\n        Cells were transfected with either miR\u2010660\u20105p, pcDNA3.1\u2010SMARCA5, or small interfering RNA targeting SMARCA5 (si\u2010SMARCA5; GenePharma, Shanghai, China). Total cellular protein extracted using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, China) were resolved on 10% gradient SDS\u2010PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate\u2010 polyacrylamide gel) then transferred onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. Membranes were blocked for one\u2009hour in 5% skim milk in TBST and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by the incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP) \u2010conjugated secondary antibody at optimized concentration. The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti\u2010nm23\u2010H1 antibody (1:500, CST), anti\u2010SMARCA5 antibody (1:2000, CST), anti\u2010RANKL antibody (1:1000, CST) and anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin antibody (1:3000, CST). The densitometry of western blot results was measured using ImageJ software.\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        The data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Student's t\u2010test was used to determine the significant differences between control and treatment groups. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS15.0 software, and P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered to be a statistically significant difference.\nResults\n      \n        Downregulation of nm23\u2010H1 expression in lung cancer cells results in upregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p expression\n        In the present study, qRT\u2010PCR and western blot assays were used to evaluate the expression of nm23\u2010H1 in normal L9981\u2010Luc and organ\u2010specific metastatic cells, including L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010LyM, L9981\u2010BoM, and L9981\u2010BrM. The results showed that nm23\u2010H1 downregulated significantly both mRNA and protein level in all the organ\u2010specific metastatic cell lines compared with the normal L9981\u2010luc cell line (Fig 1a,b). Also, the expression of miR\u2010660\u20105p was analyzed in the same cell lines, and the results showed that miR\u2010660\u20105p was upregulated in all the cell lines with organ\u2010specific metastasis potential (Fig 1c). Furthermore, the increased expression of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9980\u201099 and A549\u201099 cells with low expression of nm23\u2010H1 was validated (Fig 1d). These findings indicate that nm23\u2010H1 negatively regulates miRNA\u2010660\u20105p, and the enhanced expression of miR\u2010660\u20105p is associated with organ\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Crosstalk between nm23\u2010H1 and miR\u2010660\u20105p gene expressions in lung cancer cells.

Briefly, L9981\u2010BoM cells with high MiR\u2010660\u20105p expression were transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor or inhibitor control, whereas L9981\u2010Luc cells with low miR\u2010660\u20105p expression were transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics or NCs. A wound\u2010healing assay was used to examine cell migration ability. The downregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981\u2010BoM significantly inhibited cell migration compared to the control group (Fig 2a). Furthermore, the Boyden chamber assay was conducted to investigate the effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p on cell invasion. The invasion ability of L9981\u2010BoM cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor was lower than that of the control group (Fig 2b). Moreover, a CCK\u20108 assay was performed to investigate the effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p on cell proliferation. The proliferation ability of L9981\u2010BoM cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor was lower than that of the control group (Fig 2c). However, the normal L9981\u2010Luc cells showed an increased migration, invasion and proliferation after treatment with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics (Fig 2a\u2013c). Collectively, these results suggest that miR\u2010660\u20105p can be an oncogene, and thus inhibiting miR\u2010660\u20105p can suppress the growth, migration, and invasion of bone\u2010specific metastatic cells in vitro.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p suppression on the growth, migration, and invasion of bone\u2010specific metastatic cells in vitro.

Subsequently, tumor growth was closely monitored for eight\u2009weeks. The fluorescence value of mice in the miR\u2010660\u20105p overexpressed group was significantly higher than the negative control group (Fig 3a). The tumor size and weight were also increased significantly in the miR\u2010660\u20105p overexpressed group (Fig 3b,c). Furthermore, spinal column metastases fluorescence value of tumor\u2010bearing mice in vitro was used to investigate the effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p on bone metastasis (Fig 3d). The bone metastasis rate and fluorescence value in the miR\u2010660\u20105p overexpressed group were significantly higher than those of the control group (Fig 3e).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            MiR\u2010660\u20105p promotes lung cancer progression and bone metastasis and reverses the anti\u2010tumor effect of nm23\u2010H1 in vivo.

The cells were injected subcutaneously to the nude mice, and the fluorescence intensity was measured every week until the eighth week. The nm23\u2010H1 overexpressed group showed a significant decrease in luciferase activity, tumor size, and weight compared with the negative control group (Fig 3a\u2013c). Also, overexpression of nm23\u2010H1 significantly decreased the number of bone metastasis and metastases fluorescence value compared with the negative control group (Fig 3d,e). In addition, compared with the nm23\u2010H1 overexpressed group, the tumor size and weight, bone metastasis rate, and luciferase activity were increased in the re\u2010induced miR\u2010660\u20105p group, but the increase was not significantly higher than the negative control group (Fig 3a\u2013e).\n      \n      \n        MiR\u2010660\u20105p directly inhibits SMARCA5 expression via targeting its 3'UTR and induces RANKL signaling in lung cancer cells\n        The phenotypic results mentioned above indicate that the growth and migration of the human lung cancer cells with bone\u2010specific metastasis potential were both reduced by the inhibition of miR\u2010660\u20105p. Moreover, TARGETSCAN, MIRDB, and MICRORNA.ORG were used to predict the targets of miR\u2010660\u20105p. Notably, the results of the present study suggested that SMARCA5 was indeed a potential target of miR\u2010660\u20105p (Fig 4). The 3'\u2010UTR of SMARCA5 mRNA contained a site that complemented the seed region of miR\u2010660\u20105p (Fig 4a). The human SMARCA5 3'\u2010UTR fragments with wild\u2010type or mutant miR\u2010660\u20105p\u2010binding sequences were cloned into pMIR reporter vector (Fig 4b). The luciferase activity of pMIR\u2010SMARCA5\u20103'UTR\u2010wt construct was significantly decreased (because of the overexpression of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981 cells), whereas its mutant counterpart was not (Fig 4c). Moreover, the expression levels of SMARCA5 were determined in L9981\u2010Luc and L9981\u2010BoM cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics or inhibitors and miR\u2010NC. The mRNA and protein levels of SMARCA5 in L9981 cells were dramatically reduced after transfection with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics. Also, the SMARCA5 mRNA and protein levels were higher in the L9981\u2010BoM cells than in the miRNA control as a result of miR\u2010660\u20105p suppression (Fig 4d\u2013f). Collectively, these results indicate that SMARCA5 is a direct target of miR\u2010660\u20105p.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            MiR\u2010660\u20105p inhibits the expression of SMARCA5 through its 3'UTR.

The expression of RANKL was positively correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p expression in L9981\u2010Luc or L9981\u2010BoM cells (4E). Collectively, these results show that miR\u2010660\u20105p directly inhibits SMARCA5 expression by targeting its 3'UTR and also induces RANKL signaling of lung cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        SMARCA5 expression is inversely correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p mediated bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cell migration, invasion, and RANKL signaling\n        The expression of SMARCA5 and RANKL in normal L9981\u2010Luc and bone\u2010specific metastatic L9981\u2010BoM cells was also examined in this study. Both the mRNA and protein levels of SMARCA5 in L9981\u2010BoM cells were significantly low. Also, RANKL expression was higher in bone\u2010specific metastatic L9981\u2010BoM cells than in the normal L9981\u2010Luc cells (Fig 5a). A significant reverse correlation between SMARCA5 and RANKL (Fig 5b) was observed after transfecting pcDNA3.1\u2010SMARCA5 in L9981\u2010BoM or siSMARCA5 in L9981\u2010Luc cells for overexpression or knockdown of SMARCA5, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated whether SMARCA5 contributed to the migration and invasion of bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cells. Ectopic expression of SMARCA5 in L9981\u2010BoM cells led to a significant decrease in cell migration and invasion (Fig 5c,d); however, silencing SMARCA5 by siRNAs in L9981 cells resulted in increased migration and invasion of the cells (Fig 5c,d). Therefore, SMARCA5 was negatively correlated with bone\u2010specific metastatic cell migration and invasion.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Effect of inverse correlation between SMARCA5 and miR\u2010660\u20105p expressions on bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cell migration, invasion, and RANKL signaling.

Also, there was a significant negative correlation between SMARCA5 and RANKL expressions. Given this, we investigated whether the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p on RANKL signaling was dependent on SMARCA5. The expression level of RANKL was significantly reduced or increased in L9981\u2010BoM, and L9981\u2010Luc cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor or mimic, respectively (Fig 5e,f). After SMARCA5 silencing, RANKL inhibition induced through miR\u2010660\u20105p was reversed in L9981\u2010BoM cells (Fig 5e). Thus, SMARCA5 could be involved in the regulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p on RANKL signaling in L9981\u2010BoM cells. Also, the overexpression of SMARCA5 could reverse the increased RANKL expression induced by miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981\u2010Luc cells (Fig 5f). Collectively, these results suggest that SMARCA5 is a functional target of miR\u2010660\u20105p, which is inversely correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p mediated bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cells migration, invasion, and RANKL signaling.\nConclusion\n          Nm23\u2010H1 inhibits tumor progression and bone\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer by regulating miR\u2010660\u20105p/SMARCA5/RANKL axis, which indicates the related genes may serve as potential targets for the treatment of human lung cancer.\nKey points\n          Significant findings of the study\n          High expression of nm23\u2010H1 correlated with decreased miRNA\u2010660\u20105p expression. Further, downregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p significantly suppressed the tumor progression and bone\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells.\n          What this study adds\n          This is the first study to show an inverse association between nm23\u2010H1 and miR\u2010660\u20105p, and confirm that nm23\u2010H1 inhibits tumor progression and bone\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer by regulating miR\u2010660\u20105p/SMARCA5/RANKL axis.\nIntroduction\n      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors globally and is a threat to human health and quality of life.1 Among all human cancers, the disease has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide.2 Despite recent progress in multimodal management, lung cancer prognosis remains poor, primarily because of its aggressive metastasis to various organs.3 Cancer cells typically spread to the lymph nodes, bone, brain, and liver. The skeleton is a frequent target of lung cancer metastasis, and approximately 30% to 40% of patients with advanced lung cancer develop bone metastasis, which explains the high mortality rates and poor quality of life.4, 5 Osteolytic metastasis is associated with enhanced osteoclast activity.6 Receptor activator of NF\u2010kB ligand (RANKL) signaling is essential for the terminal differentiation of monocytes/macrophages into osteoclasts.7 Increased RANKL expression in the tumoral bone environment can increase osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity, resulting in bone metastasis.8 In our previous study, a group of organ\u2010specific metastatic cell lines which only metastasize to the spinal column, lung, brain, and mediastinal lymph node were successfully established from the parent lung cancer cell line L9981\u2010Luc.9 The four cell lines were: L9981\u2010BoM, L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010BrM and L9981\u2010LnM, respectively.9 Compared to the parent cell line (L9981\u2010Luc), the morphology and biological behavior of the four organ\u2010specific metastatic cells changed significantly.9 Given this, it will be helpful to provide reliable cell model for further studying the molecular mechanisms and signal regulation of organ\u2010specific metastasis in lung cancer.\n      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small, non\u2010coding RNAs, approximately 19\u201325 nucleotides long.10 They modulate the expression of target genes by interacting with the 3' untranslated regions (3'\u2010UTRs) of target mRNA and play an essential role in the biological and pathological processes of various diseases.11, 12 Many studies have also indicated that microRNAs can modulate tumor initiation and progression and function in tumor cell invasion and metastasis.13, 14, 15, 16 Studies have shown that miR\u2010660\u20105p regulates the malignancy of breast cancer cells by suppressing the expression of TFCP2, and is a novel therapeutic target for clinical treatment and a potential prognostic indicator.17, 18 Moreover, miR\u2010660\u20105p acts as a tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma and may regulate cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis.19 However, the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p in the pathogenesis of lung cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p in organ\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells and the molecular mechanism underlying its functions.\n      The SMARCA5 (SWI/SNF\u2010related, matrix\u2010associated, actin\u2010dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 5) belongs to the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers which have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of specific genes by altering the chromatin structure around them.20, 21 The chromosome location that determined for the SMARCA5 gene, 4q31, is within a region where loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinomas.22, 23 Furthermore, studies indicate that SMARCA5 expression is dysregulated in many human malignant tumors, such as gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and acute leukemia.24, 25, 26, 27 Also, SMARCA5 gene is a target of miRNA regulation.28, 29 However, the association between SMARCA5 expression and the formation, progression, and metastasis of lung cancer cells remains unclear.\n      The Nm23\u2010H1 gene was initially identified as a suppressor of tumor metastasis.30, 31, 32 The downregulation and hetero\u2010deletion of the gene are closely correlated with the high metastatic potential and poor prognosis of lung cancer.33, 34 Besides, the aberration of the nm23\u2010H1 gene is often companied by alteration in tumor metastasis\u2010related genes. Nm23\u2010H1 serves as an upstream regulatory gene that inhibits lung cancer metastasis by regulating downstream genes.35, 36\n\n      The results of the present study showed that nm23\u2010H1 expression was negatively correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p expression in organ\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cells. Also, the regulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p through nm23\u2010H1 was confirmed. Downregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and bone\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 was identified as one of the direct target genes of miR\u2010660\u20105p. Overexpression of SMARCA5 suppressed lung cancer cell migration and invasion. In addition, miR\u2010660\u20105p activated the RANKL signaling through SMARCA5 suppression. These results demonstrated that miR\u2010660\u20105p could be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer metastasis.\nCell lines and cell culture\n        The subcell lines (high\u2010metastatic L9981 and low\u2010metastatic NL9980) were isolated from a human lung large cell carcinoma cell line and established.37 A group of organ\u2010specific metastatic cell lines: L9981\u2010BoM, L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010BrM, and L9981\u2010LnM were established from the parent lung cancer cell line L9981\u2010Luc.9 The cell lines with stable nm23\u2010H1 gene silencing (ie, NL9980\u201099 and A549\u201099) were established from NL9980 and A549 cell lines.38 The A549 cell line was procured from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in RPMI\u20101640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 1% penicillin\u2010streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C, in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.\nQuantitative real\u2010time PCR\n        Quantitative RT\u2010PCR was performed to validate the miRNA and mRNA expression levels using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan). The PCR was performed in triplicate and analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900HT fast real\u2010time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA). The relative quantification values for each gene were calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method using U6 or GAPDH as an internal reference. The primer for miR\u2010660\u20105p was a specific miRNA primer (Hsa\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p; Ruibobio, Guangzhou, China). The other primers in this study are shown in Table S1.\nCell transfection\n        To study miR\u2010660\u20105p gene regulation, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were seeded into six\u2010well plates and cultured for 24\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C before transfection. A total of 200\u2009pmol of synthesized miR\u2010660\u20105p mimic or inhibitor (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) were transfected into L9981\u2010Luc or L9981\u2010BoM cell lines (once the cells had reached 60%\u201380% confluence) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same quantities of mimic or inhibitor were used as negative controls (NCs; GenePharma, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, transfection efficiency was verified by RT\u2010qPCR.\nCell migration assays\n        To conduct a wound\u2010healing migration assay, the cells were seeded onto 35\u2009mm dishes coated with fibronectin. Once the cells had reached 100% confluence, a scratch (approximately 500\u2009\u03bcm long) was created on the confluent monolayer using a sterile p200 pipette tip. The cell debris was then removed by replacing the medium with fresh serum\u2010free medium. During the subsequent 48\u2009hours culture of the cells, the width of the wound was measured at 0 hours, 24\u2009hours, and 48\u2009hours time points. Three to four different locations were visualized and photographed under a phase\u2010contrast inverted microscope. Images were taken in 40x field of vision.\nCell invasion assays\n        A Matrigel transwell chamber (BD), filled with the serum\u2010free medium, was used for the invasion assay. A total of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were loaded into the upper chamber. Medium containing 20% FBS was used as the chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 24\u2009hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells that had adhered to the lower membrane were fixed, stained, and counted using a microscope and a counting chamber (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Photos were taken in 100x field of vision.\nCell proliferation assay\n        Cell Counting Kit\u20108 (CCK\u20108) assay was used to analyze cell proliferation. Cells were seeded in 96 well plated at 5.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/mL and cultured for 24\u2009hours, 48\u2009hours, and 72\u2009hours durations. At the end of each time point, the cells were stained with 10\u2009\u03bcL of CCK\u20108 solution (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) then incubated for 3\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C. Each absorbance was measured at 450\u2009nm (A450) using a spectrophotometer. Each sample was run in triplicate.\nGeneration of stable miR\u2010660\u20105p and nm23\u2010H1 overexpressing cells\n        Experiments were performed using lentiviral vector (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) to obtain stable miR\u2010660\u20105p and nm23\u2010H1 overexpressing cells. Lung cancer cells were seeded at 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cell density in each 24 well plate and infected with miR\u2010660\u20105p/nm23\u2010H1/control lentiviral vector at multiplicity of infection of 10 (10 infectious units for each target cells). After 72\u2009hours of infection, cells were selected with Puromycin, and mRNA overexpression was quantified on day 10 or 30 after infection. A group of stable miR\u2010660\u20105p or nm23\u2010H1 overexpressing cells labelled L9981\u2010Luc\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p, L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1, and L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p were established.\nIn vivo assay\n        For in vivo metastasis assays, the stable cell lines L9981\u2010Luc\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p, L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1, and L9981\u2010BoM\u2010nm23\u2010H1\u2010miR\u2010660\u20105p and control cell lines L9981\u2010luc\u2010Lv\u2010NC and L9981\u2010BoM\u2010Lv\u2010NC were collected and suspended in 0.2 mL PBS for each mouse (five mice in each group, 6\u20138\u2009weeks old), and the cells were injected into the left side of the posterior flank of the nude mice. A total of 30 minutes after cell injection, luciferase substrate was injected at a dose of 150\u2009mg/kg, and live images of the mice were obtained using an IVIS200 (Xenogene, USA). These initial data were regarded as those for Day 0. Luciferase activity was measured every seven\u2009days using the same protocol. Tumor growth was measured periodically. Image\u2010Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity. Bone metastasis rate was evaluated according to the number of spinal column metastases in each group.\nDual\u2010luciferase reporter assay\n        The full\u2010length 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of SMARCA5 amplified from human genomic DNA was cloned into the downstream of the firefly luciferase coding region of pMIR\u2010GLOTM Luciferase vector (Promega, USA). The recombined vector was denoted as pMIR\u2010SMARCA5. Mutations of miR\u2010660\u20105p binding sites were introduced by site\u2010directed mutagenesis, and the resulting vector was denoted as pMIR\u2010SMARCA5\u2010Mut. Cells were seeded into 24 well plates and cotransfected with 200\u2009ng of pMIR\u2010SMARCA or pMIR\u2010SMARCA\u2010Mut vectors and 100\u2009ng of miR\u2010660\u20105p mimic or mimic control. The pRL\u2010TK plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for internal normalization. After 48\u2009hours, cells were lysed using the lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted using the Dual\u2010Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed at least three times.\nWestern blotting\n        Cells were transfected with either miR\u2010660\u20105p, pcDNA3.1\u2010SMARCA5, or small interfering RNA targeting SMARCA5 (si\u2010SMARCA5; GenePharma, Shanghai, China). Total cellular protein extracted using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, China) were resolved on 10% gradient SDS\u2010PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate\u2010 polyacrylamide gel) then transferred onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. Membranes were blocked for one\u2009hour in 5% skim milk in TBST and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by the incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP) \u2010conjugated secondary antibody at optimized concentration. The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti\u2010nm23\u2010H1 antibody (1:500, CST), anti\u2010SMARCA5 antibody (1:2000, CST), anti\u2010RANKL antibody (1:1000, CST) and anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin antibody (1:3000, CST). The densitometry of western blot results was measured using ImageJ software.\nStatistical analysis\n        The data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Student's t\u2010test was used to determine the significant differences between control and treatment groups. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS15.0 software, and P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered to be a statistically significant difference.\nDownregulation of nm23\u2010H1 expression in lung cancer cells results in upregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p expression\n        In the present study, qRT\u2010PCR and western blot assays were used to evaluate the expression of nm23\u2010H1 in normal L9981\u2010Luc and organ\u2010specific metastatic cells, including L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010LyM, L9981\u2010BoM, and L9981\u2010BrM. The results showed that nm23\u2010H1 downregulated significantly both mRNA and protein level in all the organ\u2010specific metastatic cell lines compared with the normal L9981\u2010luc cell line (Fig 1a,b). Also, the expression of miR\u2010660\u20105p was analyzed in the same cell lines, and the results showed that miR\u2010660\u20105p was upregulated in all the cell lines with organ\u2010specific metastasis potential (Fig 1c). Furthermore, the increased expression of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9980\u201099 and A549\u201099 cells with low expression of nm23\u2010H1 was validated (Fig 1d). These findings indicate that nm23\u2010H1 negatively regulates miRNA\u2010660\u20105p, and the enhanced expression of miR\u2010660\u20105p is associated with organ\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells.\n        \n          Figure 1\n          \n            Crosstalk between nm23\u2010H1 and miR\u2010660\u20105p gene expressions in lung cancer cells.

Briefly, L9981\u2010BoM cells with high MiR\u2010660\u20105p expression were transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor or inhibitor control, whereas L9981\u2010Luc cells with low miR\u2010660\u20105p expression were transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics or NCs. A wound\u2010healing assay was used to examine cell migration ability. The downregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981\u2010BoM significantly inhibited cell migration compared to the control group (Fig 2a). Furthermore, the Boyden chamber assay was conducted to investigate the effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p on cell invasion. The invasion ability of L9981\u2010BoM cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor was lower than that of the control group (Fig 2b). Moreover, a CCK\u20108 assay was performed to investigate the effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p on cell proliferation. The proliferation ability of L9981\u2010BoM cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor was lower than that of the control group (Fig 2c). However, the normal L9981\u2010Luc cells showed an increased migration, invasion and proliferation after treatment with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics (Fig 2a\u2013c). Collectively, these results suggest that miR\u2010660\u20105p can be an oncogene, and thus inhibiting miR\u2010660\u20105p can suppress the growth, migration, and invasion of bone\u2010specific metastatic cells in vitro.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p suppression on the growth, migration, and invasion of bone\u2010specific metastatic cells in vitro.

Subsequently, tumor growth was closely monitored for eight\u2009weeks. The fluorescence value of mice in the miR\u2010660\u20105p overexpressed group was significantly higher than the negative control group (Fig 3a). The tumor size and weight were also increased significantly in the miR\u2010660\u20105p overexpressed group (Fig 3b,c). Furthermore, spinal column metastases fluorescence value of tumor\u2010bearing mice in vitro was used to investigate the effect of miR\u2010660\u20105p on bone metastasis (Fig 3d). The bone metastasis rate and fluorescence value in the miR\u2010660\u20105p overexpressed group were significantly higher than those of the control group (Fig 3e).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            MiR\u2010660\u20105p promotes lung cancer progression and bone metastasis and reverses the anti\u2010tumor effect of nm23\u2010H1 in vivo.

The cells were injected subcutaneously to the nude mice, and the fluorescence intensity was measured every week until the eighth week. The nm23\u2010H1 overexpressed group showed a significant decrease in luciferase activity, tumor size, and weight compared with the negative control group (Fig 3a\u2013c). Also, overexpression of nm23\u2010H1 significantly decreased the number of bone metastasis and metastases fluorescence value compared with the negative control group (Fig 3d,e). In addition, compared with the nm23\u2010H1 overexpressed group, the tumor size and weight, bone metastasis rate, and luciferase activity were increased in the re\u2010induced miR\u2010660\u20105p group, but the increase was not significantly higher than the negative control group (Fig 3a\u2013e).\nMiR\u2010660\u20105p directly inhibits SMARCA5 expression via targeting its 3'UTR and induces RANKL signaling in lung cancer cells\n        The phenotypic results mentioned above indicate that the growth and migration of the human lung cancer cells with bone\u2010specific metastasis potential were both reduced by the inhibition of miR\u2010660\u20105p. Moreover, TARGETSCAN, MIRDB, and MICRORNA.ORG were used to predict the targets of miR\u2010660\u20105p. Notably, the results of the present study suggested that SMARCA5 was indeed a potential target of miR\u2010660\u20105p (Fig 4). The 3'\u2010UTR of SMARCA5 mRNA contained a site that complemented the seed region of miR\u2010660\u20105p (Fig 4a). The human SMARCA5 3'\u2010UTR fragments with wild\u2010type or mutant miR\u2010660\u20105p\u2010binding sequences were cloned into pMIR reporter vector (Fig 4b). The luciferase activity of pMIR\u2010SMARCA5\u20103'UTR\u2010wt construct was significantly decreased (because of the overexpression of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981 cells), whereas its mutant counterpart was not (Fig 4c). Moreover, the expression levels of SMARCA5 were determined in L9981\u2010Luc and L9981\u2010BoM cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics or inhibitors and miR\u2010NC. The mRNA and protein levels of SMARCA5 in L9981 cells were dramatically reduced after transfection with miR\u2010660\u20105p mimics. Also, the SMARCA5 mRNA and protein levels were higher in the L9981\u2010BoM cells than in the miRNA control as a result of miR\u2010660\u20105p suppression (Fig 4d\u2013f). Collectively, these results indicate that SMARCA5 is a direct target of miR\u2010660\u20105p.\n        \n          Figure 4\n          \n            MiR\u2010660\u20105p inhibits the expression of SMARCA5 through its 3'UTR.

The expression of RANKL was positively correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p expression in L9981\u2010Luc or L9981\u2010BoM cells (4E). Collectively, these results show that miR\u2010660\u20105p directly inhibits SMARCA5 expression by targeting its 3'UTR and also induces RANKL signaling of lung cancer cells.\nSMARCA5 expression is inversely correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p mediated bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cell migration, invasion, and RANKL signaling\n        The expression of SMARCA5 and RANKL in normal L9981\u2010Luc and bone\u2010specific metastatic L9981\u2010BoM cells was also examined in this study. Both the mRNA and protein levels of SMARCA5 in L9981\u2010BoM cells were significantly low. Also, RANKL expression was higher in bone\u2010specific metastatic L9981\u2010BoM cells than in the normal L9981\u2010Luc cells (Fig 5a). A significant reverse correlation between SMARCA5 and RANKL (Fig 5b) was observed after transfecting pcDNA3.1\u2010SMARCA5 in L9981\u2010BoM or siSMARCA5 in L9981\u2010Luc cells for overexpression or knockdown of SMARCA5, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated whether SMARCA5 contributed to the migration and invasion of bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cells. Ectopic expression of SMARCA5 in L9981\u2010BoM cells led to a significant decrease in cell migration and invasion (Fig 5c,d); however, silencing SMARCA5 by siRNAs in L9981 cells resulted in increased migration and invasion of the cells (Fig 5c,d). Therefore, SMARCA5 was negatively correlated with bone\u2010specific metastatic cell migration and invasion.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Effect of inverse correlation between SMARCA5 and miR\u2010660\u20105p expressions on bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cell migration, invasion, and RANKL signaling.

Also, there was a significant negative correlation between SMARCA5 and RANKL expressions. Given this, we investigated whether the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p on RANKL signaling was dependent on SMARCA5. The expression level of RANKL was significantly reduced or increased in L9981\u2010BoM, and L9981\u2010Luc cells transfected with miR\u2010660\u20105p inhibitor or mimic, respectively (Fig 5e,f). After SMARCA5 silencing, RANKL inhibition induced through miR\u2010660\u20105p was reversed in L9981\u2010BoM cells (Fig 5e). Thus, SMARCA5 could be involved in the regulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p on RANKL signaling in L9981\u2010BoM cells. Also, the overexpression of SMARCA5 could reverse the increased RANKL expression induced by miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981\u2010Luc cells (Fig 5f). Collectively, these results suggest that SMARCA5 is a functional target of miR\u2010660\u20105p, which is inversely correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p mediated bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cells migration, invasion, and RANKL signaling.\nDiscussion\n      Tumor cells tend to spread (metastasize) to adjacent and distant tissues and organs which poses a considerable challenge to cancer treatment and management. Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients.44 Lung cancer metastasis has organ\u2010specific characteristics. For studying the mechanisms and signal regulation of organ\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer, our laboratory screened and established an organ\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cell model from the parent lung cancer cell line L9981\u2010Luc, including L9981\u2010BrM, L9981\u2010LuM, L9981\u2010BoM, L9981\u2010LnM, which are only able metastasized to brain, lung, spinal column and mediastinal lymph nodes.9 The nm23\u2010H1 gene is a well\u2010known suppressor of tumor metastasis. In this study, nm23\u2010H1 was significantly downregulated in all four organ\u2010specific metastasis cell lines, which suggested that organ\u2010specific metastasis could occur as a result of nm23\u2010H1 suppression. The downregulation of nm23\u2010H1 might influence the expression of some genes downstream.\n      Several lines of evidence have indicated that miRNAs play a crucial role in tumor formation and progression.13, 14, 15, 16 Previous studies have revealed that miR\u2010660\u20105p is dysregulated in several human malignancies. For example, miR\u2010660\u20105p is upregulated in breast cancer, and it may be a potential oncogene that plays a vital role in the development and metastasis of breast cancer.17 Another study reported that miR\u2010660\u20105p expression was significantly downregulated in renal cell carcinoma and could act as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis.19 Also, dysregulated miR\u2010660\u20105p expression has been reported in Hodgkin's lymphoma45 and multiple myeloma.46 In the present study, miR\u2010660\u20105p was significantly upregulated in all four organ\u2010specific metastasis cell lines with lower nm23\u2010H1 expression than normal L9981\u2010Luc. Thus, we speculated that negative regulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p by nm23\u2010H1 might be involved in the organ\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells. However, the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p in lung cancer cell migration and invasion remains unclear.\n      Herein, the role of miR\u2010660\u20105p in lung cancer cell progression was investigated. The downregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p in bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cell L9981\u2010BoM significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, whereas the upregulation of miR\u2010660\u20105p in L9981\u2010Luc significantly promoted lung cancer tumorigenesis and bone\u2010specific metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the reintroduction of miR\u2010660\u20105p reversed nm23\u2010H1 mediated antitumor and antibone\u2010specific metastatic effect in L9981\u2010BoM in vivo. These results suggested that miR\u2010660\u20105p could serve as a downstream gene of nm23\u2010H1, and could be a novel potential oncogene that plays a vital role in the development and bone\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer.\n      The biological function of miRNAs is to regulate target genes by directly inactivating mRNA or inhibiting protein synthesis.11, 12 In the current study, it was revealed that SMARCA5 has a binding site for miR\u2010660\u20105p within its 3'\u2010UTR region, as earlier predicted. Furthermore, SMARCA5 was characterized as a functional target of miR\u2010660\u20105p by luciferase reporter gene assays, RT\u2010PCR, and western blot analysis. The imitation switch (ISWI) nuclear ATPase SMARCA5 (Snf2h) is one of the most conserved chromatin remodeling factors which are associated with various developmental disorders and cancer.21, 22 A study reported that SMARCA5 expression was higher in gastric cancer samples than in normal mucosa24 and overexpression of SMARCA5 correlated with cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer.25 In the present study, SMARCA5 expression was inversely correlated with miR\u2010660\u20105p expression. Overexpression of SMARCA5 suppressed the L9981\u2010BoM cell invasion and migration, indicating that SMARCA5 could be involved in the regulation of tumor progression in bone\u2010specific metastatic lung cancer cells.\n      Receptor activator of NF\u2010kB ligand (RANKL) signaling is essential for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption that contribute to the underlying pathogenesis of tumor cell metastasis to the bone.7, 8 The RANKL protein expression in cancer cells plays a pivotal role in bone metastasis. Xianbo et al. suggested that the movement of lung cancer cells from primary sites to bone metastatic sites could depend on the level of RANKL expression. In their study, the RANKL expression was increased at both transcript and protein levels in the most metastatic cell line.47 Moreover, osteolytic metastasis has been successfully inhibited in several types of cancer, including multiple myeloma and prostate cancer through the suppression of RANKL signaling.41, 43 This study also found similar results that showed that RANKL expression was upregulated in bone\u2010specific metastasis L9981\u2010BoM cells compared to L9981\u2010Luc cells. Also, it was observed that RANKL expression was influenced by miR\u2010660\u20105p expression. The RANKL expression induced by miR\u2010660\u20105p was reversed as a result of SMARCA5 knockdown, indicating that miR\u2010660\u20105p could play a role in bone\u2010specific metastasis of lung cancer cells by modulating RANKL signaling through targeting SMARCA5. However, more detailed mechanisms involving other relevant downstream factors in the process should be investigated further.\n      In conclusion, the results of this study show that nm23\u2010H1 negatively regulates miR\u2010660\u20105p (as a downstream gene). Moreover, miR\u2010660\u20105p influences the proliferation, migration, invasion, and bone\u2010specific metastasis of human lung cancer cells through the miR\u2010660\u20105p/SMARCA5/RANKL signaling pathways. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the development of human lung cancer, particularly bone\u2010specific metastasis. MiR\u2010660\u20105p and its downstream targets may be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment and prognosis of human lung cancer.\nDisclosure\n      The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\nSupporting information\n      \n        \n          \nTable S1 Sequences of components used in this study.\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.",
