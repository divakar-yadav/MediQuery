Thirty patients will be included consecutively. With an anticipated loss of 4-10 patients, at least 20 are expected to complete the study.\n\nThe clinical assessment protocols include standardized measures for the assessment of clinical and self-perceived aspects of functioning and disability. These assessments will be performed and repeated \\< 1 month, at 3 months and 6 months post-stroke by a therapist not responsible for rehabilitation interventions. At each of these assessment instances, laboratory movement analysis including electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound of the lower extremity muscle will be performed. In addition, a short assessment of body function and activity will be performed weekly during inpatient rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Inpatients","Recovery of Function","Observational Study"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Observational","description":"Laboratory movement analysis, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and clinical aspects of gait function and walking."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer score (FMA-LE)","description":"Assesses sensory and movement related functions in the lower extremity (0p max impairment summed up to 86p max no detected impairment)","timeFrame":"At baseline, weekly during inpatient rehab and at 3 and 6 months to assess change."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motion analysis during gait","description":"In a movement laboratory (Vicon V16), data for motion analysis will be collected by assessing orientation of body segments and joint angle trajectories and forces by means of force plates (AMTI) during walking.","timeFrame":"At baseline, at 3 and 6 months to assess change."},{"measure":"Electromyography (EMG)","description":"EMG is used to measure muscle activation patterns during gait.","timeFrame":"At baseline, at 3 and 6 months to assess change."},{"measure":"Neuroflexor","description":"Medical technology device.
