overground gait training), 30min per session\n\nPrimary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and foot pressure distribution measured by F-Scan Mobile system (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA).\n\nSecondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function improvement evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA), Korean version Modified Bathel index (K-MBI), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), Fugl-Meyer assessment for lower extremity (FMA), Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES), Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion (ROM)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Healthy"],"keywords":["Exoskeleton Device","elderly","stroke","gait rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Samsung Hip Assist v1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"gait rehabilitation with Samsung Hip Assist v1 10 sessions (5sessions -
