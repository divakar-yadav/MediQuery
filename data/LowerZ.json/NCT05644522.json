The main questions it aims to answer are to quantify the effectiveness of the Nomad in improving mobility, balance, frequency of falls, and quality of life in individuals with lower-extremity impairments compared to their own brace, over three months of daily home and community use.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Wear a sensor that records everyday activities and mobility.\n* Perform measures of mobility and different activities of participation using their own brace.\n* Perform measures of mobility and different activities of participation using the Nomad powered KAFO"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Post-polio Syndrome","Spinal Cord Injuries","Multiple Sclerosis","Muscular Dystrophy","Paralysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group A receives the intervention Nomad KAFO first; fitting \\& training will occur with the intervention and will then be used for a 3 month home trial, followed by outcomes testing.
