Although mortality-to-incidence ratios have decreased, the global burden of stroke in terms of the absolute number of people affected every year and stroke-related deaths are increasing (Krishnamurthi et al., 2013). Taking into account the demographic changes of our society up to 12 million stroke deaths and 70 million stroke survivors are expected in 2030 (Krishnamurthi et al., 2013).\n\nIn Switzerland 15'000 people suffer a stroke every year (Jorgensen, Nakayama, Raaschou, \\& Olsen, 1995). Three months after stroke 20% of the affected patients are still bound to a wheelchair and 70% show limited gait ability, therefore, the restoration of gait ability is one of the most important therapy goals. Since motor restoration especially takes place during the first six months the choice of a proper gait therapy is of great importance (Jorgensen et al., 1995).\n\nSince repetition and task-specific activity have been shown to be key factors for motor (re)-learning (Kwakkel, Kollen, \\& Lindeman, 2004) (French et al., 2007) treadmill training with body weight support has been implemented in stroke rehabilitation. However, no superiority of treadmill training compared to conventional over ground gait training could have been shown to date. Especially patients who cannot walk at all don't seem to benefit from treadmill training to a greater extent (J Mehrholz et al., 2014). A possible explanation therefor is the tremendous therapeutic effort needed to move severely impaired patients on a treadmill. To obtain a higher therapeutic efficiency (reduce therapeutic effort and increased number of steps) electromechanical-assisted gait devices have been developed. During electromechanical-assisted gait therapy the patient is either moved by the means of a robotic-driven exoskeleton orthosis (exoskeleton device) (Colombo, Joerg, Schreier, \\& Dietz, 2000) or two mechanically driven foot plates simulating the gait pattern (end-effector device) (Hesse, Sarkodie-Gyan, \\& Uhlenbrock, 1999).\n\nOver the last decade different studies have evaluated the effect of the implementation of the exoskeleton and end-effector devices within the rehabilitation process of stroke patients (Jan Mehrholz et al., 2013). RCTs have shown the superiority of the combination of conventional over ground gait training supplemented by electromechanical-assisted gait devices in comparison with conventional over ground gait training alone (Jan Mehrholz et al., 2013). Especially non-ambulatory patients in the subacute phase (\\< 3 months after stroke) benefit from this type of intervention. Furthermore, the choice of the right gait device matters. A sub analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the recovery of walking speed in favor of the end-effector compared to exoskeleton devices (Jan Mehrholz et al., 2013). The largest study ever performed with an end-effector device, \"Deutsche Gangtrainer Studie (DEGAS)\" showed that a training program of 20 therapy sessions each consisting of 20 minutes walking on an end-effector device combined with 25 minutes of conventional physiotherapy more than doubles the chance of regaining an independent gait ability compared to the same dosage of conventional physiotherapy alone (Pohl et al., 2007). Furthermore, the use of electromechanical-assisted gait therapy is safe and does not result in more adverse events (AE) than conventional physiotherapy (Jan Mehrholz et al., 2013).\n\nMany of the performed RCTs with electromechanical-assisted gait therapy have chosen a high training intensity of up to five training sessions per week. According to those findings the German Society for Neurorehabilitation (DGNR) recommends in the so-called S2e-Guidelines \"Rehabilitation der Mobilität nach Schlaganfall (ReMoS)\" a training dosage of 500-1000 steps per day for non-ambulatory stroke patients (Loipl \\& Wittenberg, 2015). In daily clinical routine however, it is almost impossible to achieve such a high training intensity due to limited resources. Thus, it remains unclear whether a realistic therapy program including around three electromechanical-assisted gait training sessions per week leads to the same beneficial effects on gait ability. Therefore, the aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of electromechanical-assisted gait training within an integrated, practice-orientated physical therapy protocol, which is compared to the effects of the same amount of physical therapy without electromechanical-assisted gait training in subacute stroke patients.\n\nStudy 0verall Objective:\n\nThe aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of an integrated, practice-orientated individual physical therapy protocol with respectively without electromechanical-assisted gait training in subacute stroke patients.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo compare the effect of both physical therapy protocols with respect to gait ability and competence in basic ADL.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo compare the effect of both physical therapy protocols with respect to walking speed, walking capacity, functional mobility, muscle force, spasticity, and RNLI.\n\nAs further objectives, different training-related data are recorded to capture the efficiency (intensity and hassle) of both physical therapy protocols.\n\nSafety Objectives The risks of this study are kept to a minimum. No specific safety objectives have been defined.\n\nPrimary Study Outcome:\n\nThe changes in gait ability and the competence in basic ADL are determined as primary outcomes. Both are assessed before and after the four-week intervention period (to proof short term effects) as well as three months after the end of the intevention period (3months FU).\n\nGait ability and competence in basic ADL are regarded as to be the most important therapy goals of subacute stroke patients. Furthermore, these outcomes were also used in other clinical trials with electromechanical-assisted gait training making results comparable.\n\nGait ability (ICF-level activity):\n\nTo assess gait ability the FAC is performed. The FAC is technically simple, inexpensive, reliable and sensitive to change in the assessment of patients after stroke who cannot walk without personal assistance at the beginning of their inpatient rehabilitation. The FAC provides information about the way of physical (not technical e.g. walking aids, orthosis) assistance that is needed for walking.\n\nCompetence in basic ADL (ICF-level activity):\n\nTo assess competence in basic ADL the FIM is performed (ANQ, 2013). The FIM shows an excellent test-retest-reliability (Hobart et al., 2001), an excellent internal consistency, excellent criterion validity and high responsiveness (for the motor subscale) in stroke patients (Jan Mehrholz, Wagner, Rutte, Meißner, \\& Pohl, 2007). The nurses from ZRW assess the FIM in every rehabilitation service unit on a weekly basis(Tyson \\& Connell, 2009). Therefore, a high level of standardisation is given.\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\nThe changes in walking speed, walking capacity, muscle force, spasticity, functional mobility and RNLI are determined as secondary outcomes. All secondary outcomes except RNLI are assessed before and after the four-week intervention period. RNLI is measured at the 3months FU.\n\nWalking speed (ICF-level activity):\n\nTo assess walking speed the 10mWT is performed. The 10mWT is a simple, highly reliable and valid test for the assessment of walking speed in stroke patients (Tyson \\& Connell, 2009). It is carried out in patients with a FAC-level \\>=2. Lower FAC-levels are not tested.\n\nWalking capacity (ICF-level activity):\n\nTo assess walking capacity the 6minWT is performed. The 6minWT is a simple and valid test which is used to assess maximum walking distance. It shows adequate reliability and excellent validity in stroke patients (Kosak \\& Smith, 2005). The 6minWT is carried out in patients with FAC-Level \\>=2. Lower FAC-levels are not tested.\n\nFunctional Mobility (ICF-level activity):\n\nFor the assessment of mobility, the DEMMI is chosen. The DEMMI consists of 17 basic everyday mobility tasks differentiating between 5 conditions (bed, chair, static balance, walking and dynamic balance) (de Morton, Davidson, \\& Keating, 2008). The DEMMI is a practical, short and valid mobility test for geriatric and stroke patients that is sensitive to detect changes (Braun et al., 2015).\n\nMuscular Strength lower extremities (ICF-level structure/function):\n\nChange of lower extremities muscular strength is measured with the Motricity Index (MI). Due to the present intervention studied only the muscle force of the lower limbs will be evaluated (hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion). Previous studies have shown that the MI is a valid, reliable and sensitive tool that is short and easily to apply (Collin \\& Wade, 1990; Demeurisse, Demol, \\& Robaye, 1980).\n\nSpasticity (ICF-level structure/function):\n\nQuantification of spasticity of the affected lower limb is carried out with the mTS. The mTS has shown to have very good test-retest reliability and sensitivity that is high enough to measure changes pre-post treatment (Jan Mehrholz et al., 2005).\n\nReintegration to normal living (ICF-level participation):\n\nFor the assessment of the ICF level participation the RNLI is chosen. The instrument can be used to evaluate the degree to which the patient has been able to return to a normal life (Wood-Dauphinee \\& Williams, 1987)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Monocentric, randomised-controlled, single-blind trial.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Only assessors of the primary outcomes will be blinded to group assignment","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group (EG)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subacute stroke patients will get standard individual physical therapy 2x/week, 45min and electromechanical-assisted gait training on LYRA® gait trainer 3x/week, 45min.","interventionNames":["Device: LYRA® gait trainer"]},{"label":"Comparator group (CG)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The CG will get standard individual physical therapy 5x/week, 45min without any instrument-based locomotion therapy (i.e. treadmill training, electromechanical/robot-assisted gait training).","interventionNames":["Device: Standard individual physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"LYRA® gait trainer","description":"The EG will get standard individual physical therapy (5x/week, 45min) whereby three sessions of electromechanical-assisted gait training on LYRA® gait trainer.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group (EG)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Standard individual physical therapy","description":"The CG will get standard individual physical therapy (5x/week, 45min) without any instrument-based locomotion therapy (i.e. treadmill training, electromechanical/robot-assisted gait training).","armGroupLabels":["Comparator group (CG)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait ability (ICF-level activity)","description":"To assess change in gait ability the FAC is performed.
