The control group will receive usual care consistent with existing rehabilitation practice and literature. The experimental group will perform task specific strength training in a ballistic fashion.","detailedDescription":"Research Aims:\n\n1. To establish the feasibility of ballistic strength training in stroke and\n2. To evaluate the effects of ballistic strength training exercises on mobility outcomes, strength and quality of life when compared with usual care.\n\nMethods:\n\nThis wil be a prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded pilot study. It will be conducted 3 x per week for 6 weeks (i.e. a total of 18 sessions lasting 30 minutes).\n\nPrimary outcome measure: Feasibility\n\n* Recruitment\n* Retention/Attrition\n* Clinical Feasibility\n* Safety\n\nSecondary outcome measures - measured at baseline and completion\n\n* Ten metre walk test (10MWT) comfortable pace\n* 10MWT maximum safe pace\n* High level mobility assessment tool (HiMAT): Only in participants where 10MWT is \\<12.5s at baseline\n* Timed up and go test (TUG)\n* Functional Ambulation Category (FAC)\n* Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) via AQoL-4D\n\nDescription of intervention:\n\nControl Group:\n\nThe control group will complete a suite of exercises based upon existing rehabilitation practices that aim to improve mobility after stroke. The supervising physiotherapist will select and progress the exercises, recording the performance of exercises in an exercise log and detailing incidence of adverse events.
