The study will be conducted at approximately 65 sites in the United States.\n\nTwo cohorts, Group 1 (2.5 and 5 million SB623 cells combined) and Group 2 (sham placebo), will be included in this study. Subjects who are randomized into this study will receive either 2.5 million SB623 cells, 5 million SB623 cells or sham surgery at a 1:1:1 randomization ratio.

As a result, the UE-FMMS subscale score ranged from 0 to 66 and the LE-FMMS subscale score ranged from 0 to 34.

The ARAT is a 19-item measure divided into 4 subtests: Grasp subscale (with 6 items and a score range of 0 to 18); Grip subscale with 4 items and a score range of 0 to 12); Pinch subscale with 6 items and a score range of 0 to 18); Gross arm movement subscale (with 3 items and a score range of 0 to 9).
