Stroke can alter the level of consciousness, motor and cognitive skills, sensory perception and language; it all depends on the extent of injury and the region of brain that is affected. Even though all the rehabilitation given to the \"stroke\" patients, but still 25-30% of the survivors still have gait and balance problem and they require complete physical support before their discharge from the hospital. Backward treadmill walking has reported numerous benefits in improving balance, motor function and gait. Cross training is a technique which is applied to healthy limb of the individual to increase muscle strength and muscle activity.so the aim of this study is to find the effects of backward treadmill walking and lower extremity cross training on gross motor function and balance among stroke patients.\n\nThe study will be randomized clinical trials, Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups each group will have 13. This study will be conducted in Safi teaching Hospital Faisalabad. Group A will be treated with backward treadmill walking and group B will be treated with lower extremity cross training. All participants will receive conventional physical exercises which includes general mobility and functional activities. In this study, the 40-minute training programs for both groups will be occur 5 times a week for 6 weeks, with 5 minutes being allocated for warm up, 30 minutes devoted to the main exercise, and 5 minutes for cool down. Outcome will be measured before and after giving treatment by using Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment and lower extremity functional scale. The results will be calculated by using SPSS version 25. Frequencies and mean standard deviation will be measured, parametric and non-parametric tests will be applied"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Backward treadmill walking group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Backward treadmill walking"]},{"label":"Lower extremity cross training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Lower extremity cross training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Backward treadmill walking","description":"Backward Treadmill walking will be given to this group.
