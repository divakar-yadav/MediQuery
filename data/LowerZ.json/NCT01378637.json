The aims of the proposed project are to obtain a set of data from a total of 20 chronic stroke subjects, all with severe lower extremity disability, between the ages of 18-85, using a robotic therapeutic device placed in a rehabilitation clinic. This data will allow us to quantify the extent to which a combination of robotic-assisted exercise and tendon vibration from the AMES beta device induces secondary recovery from the effects of stroke on the lower extremity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Leg","Robotic device","AMES","Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AMES Leg treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An investigational device flexes and extends the ankle over a range of 30 degrees while vibrators stimulate the tendons attached to muscles that move the foot.
