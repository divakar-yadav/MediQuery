The primary outcome was the outcome prediction rate using fNIRS parameter and clinical parameters. Secondary outcomes were as follows: fNIRS activation pattern, Laterality Index, Functional Connectivity, Fugl-Meyer Score, Modified Barthel Index, , Brunnstrom Stage, Box and Block Test, Grip Strength (handgrip, pinch grip, lateral prehension, three-jaw chuck), Modified Ashworth Scale (wrist flexor and extensor spasticity, elbow flexor, and extensor spasticity, long finger flexor spasticity), modified Rankin Scale score, Functional Ambulation Category, Glasgow Coma Scale, Neglect Evaluation Battery, Korean Version Western Aphasia Battery, and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia.\n\nThe changes in the fNIRS measurements and clinical parameters will be analyzed and also the correlation between the two will be analyzed to identify the prognostic value of fNIRS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":136,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"fNIRS applied","description":"All of the participants' brain activity was evaluated with fNIRS.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: functional near-infrared spectroscopy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"functional near-infrared spectroscopy","description":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive method that can evaluate the brain function by measuring the change in brain metabolic activity and hemodynamics during a given task with near-infrared spectroscopy.","armGroupLabels":["fNIRS applied"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Outcome Prediction Rate","description":"Outcome prediction rate using fNIRS parameter and clinical parameters.","timeFrame":"After 2-3 weeks from stroke onset (T0), Immediately after 2-3 weeks of rehabilitation (T1), After 1-3 months from stroke onset (T2)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of fNIRS activation pattern","description":"The activation pattern was analyzed by nirsLAB software.
