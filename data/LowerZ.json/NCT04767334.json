In Saudi Arabia stroke considered as the main leading of disability and death. It is estimated to be 0.67% in Saudi Arabia compared to 2.5% of the population in the United States (US). Most of individuals have mobility deficit such as walk speed and postural maintenance which lead to increase the risk of fall and decrease activity of daily living (ADL).\n\nStroke rehabilitation should starts as early as possible to avoid post-stroke complications. Several interventions for stroke rehabilitation to improve mobility deficit and posture control continuously being evaluated. One of the ways of stroke rehabilitation is a using of body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT). It is a useful tool to facilitate gait training and recovery after neurological injures.\n\nThe lower body positive pressure (LBPP) is a treadmill that is enclosed in inflated bag. There is a chamber inside the treadmill that is produce air pressure which is aid in eliminate the uncomfortableness feeling produce by weight bearing during gait. The chamber is supplied with a system provide LBPP aiding in decrease patient weight while walking by giving the patient lifting force from below using air pressure. This helps the patient to walk affectively with minimum weight bearing on the lower extremity.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of LBPP on gait function, balance and quality of life in chronic stroke individuals.\n\nThe investigators hypothesis that the LBPP will significantly improve gait function, balance, quality of life in chronic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gait training on Lower body positive pressure","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will have gait training for 40 minutes a day, for three days a week, for six weeks.
