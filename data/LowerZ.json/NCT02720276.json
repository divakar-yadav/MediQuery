Ten individuals will initially receive exercise instructions to their smartphones via Short Message Service (SMS) for 6 weeks and after that instructions by a video link (6 weeks). Another 10 individuals will initially receive instructions by a video link and then switching to management with SMS after 6 weeks of training.\n\nIntervention: Participants are supposed to perform an outdoor walking exercise program for 12 weeks. The walks should gradually increase in frequency and intensity, and is expected to start after discharge from the stroke department, after the assessment. The first 2 weeks start with daily walks. The walks will be conducted at a pace that increases the heart rate but still makes it possible to talk. The intensity and frequency of walks will progressively increase performed according to the Borg scale: 12-15, ie, moderate to strenuous. Participants will walk 5-7 days/week. Added to this is a strength exercise, which should be performed in connection with the walk training.\n\nMethods: Questionnaires and medical records used for documentation of age, sex, comorbidity, blood pressure, medications and previous education.\n\nAssessment of motor function, cognition, level of physical activity are only performed as screening at baseline measurements. Objective evaluation of the participants' adherence to the outdoor walking program will be measured with a training diary where the individual documents whether they have followed the training instructions.\n\nPower analysis is not performed since this is an exploratory study. The investigators will analyze the data using an intention-to -treat. The investigators will also do a 'per-protocol analysis, where only participants who completed the training are included. Participants should have participated in at least 50% of the training sessions. All analyzes will be done using SPSS version 23 (IBM, Armonk)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","exercise","walking","mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Training after acute stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Outdoor walking and strength training.","interventionNames":["Other: Training after acute stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Training after acute stroke","description":"Outdoor walking: Participants will receive daily training instructions via Short message Service (SMS) over 12 weeks.
