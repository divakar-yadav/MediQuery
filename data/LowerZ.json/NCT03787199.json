Clinical utility encompasses practicability, acceptability, appropriateness, and accessibility. In this study, the investigators would like to investigate several aspects of clinical utility that belong to the first three components.","detailedDescription":"The specific aims of the current project are:\n\n1. To investigate the practicability, the investigators plan to determine the accuracy of the weight-supporting system of the Andago and the time needed for donning and doffing. The investigators also evaluate the number of times that the device stops and the nature of these stops (due to errors, sitting of the patient, when preventing falls, or when the patient moves too fast).\n2. To evaluate acceptability, the investigators plan to evaluate differences in motivation and measures reflecting safety (i.e. number of falls prevented) and subjective feeling of safety when patients walk with the Andago compared to walking with their usual walking aids.\n3. To evaluate the appropriateness, the investigators are interested in differences between walking on a treadmill and walking overground with this device or changes that occur during walking overground when changing the level of BWS through the unloading system. Therapists should be aware of these differences to know what the advantage of such a system could be or how adjustments in settings influence the walking pattern. The investigators plan two investigations: (a) To determine differences in stride-to-stride variability, leg muscle activation, hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and other gait parameters during walking in the Andago (overground) versus walking on a treadmill. (b) To determine differences in the same parameters when walking in the Andago with different levels of BWS. These levels are the minimal required level of BWS to walk without buckling the knees (ref BWS), ref BWS plus 15% and ref BWS plus 30%.\n\nTo investigate these aims, the patients will be asked to participate in 3 appointments, which should be scheduled within 10 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait Disorders, Neurologic","Cerebral Palsy","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Child, Only","Gait Disorders in Children"],"keywords":["Andago","Feasibility","Pediatric Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Feasibility study, including a comparison between Andago and treadmill walking conditions (as we include a heterogeneous group of participants concerning age (children/adolescents), diagnosis, walking ability, etc., we include in this feasibility study 20 participants - rather than the usual 10).\n\nPatients participate in 3 appointments (planned within 10 days):\n\nAppointment 1 (60 min): patient characteristics, clinical tests (Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity / Manual Muscle Testing / 10 meter walk test or 10MWT); practising on treadmill and in Andago; questions to participants\n\nAppointment 2 (45 min): determine accuracy of the unloading system; practicing on treadmill and in Andago; questions to participant\n\nAppointment 3 (60-90 min): 10MWT at onset and end; measurement of stride length, leg muscle EMG and joint kinematics during walking on treadmill with bodyweight unloading and walking overground with Andago with 3 levels of bodyweight unloading","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Andago","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Application of walking over-ground with body-weight support in the Andago","interventionNames":["Device: Andago"]},{"label":"Treadmill","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Application of walking on a treadmill with body-weight support","interventionNames":["Other: Treadmill"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Andago","description":"The Andago is a body-weight supporting device with which a patient can walk overground","armGroupLabels":["Andago"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Treadmill","description":"Bodyweight supported treadmill walking","armGroupLabels":["Treadmill"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stride to stride variability","description":"Variability in stride length recorded during at least 20 steps for each of the following conditions: Andago with reference bodyweight support; Andago with 15% more bodyweight support; Andago with 30% more bodyweight support; and treadmill condition with reference bodyweight support","timeFrame":"Appointment 3 (between minute 25 and minute 55 )"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Leg muscle activity","description":"Amplitude of electromyographic recordings recorded during at least 20 steps for each of the following conditions: Andago with reference bodyweight support; Andago with 15% more bodyweight support; Andago with 30% more bodyweight support; and treadmill condition with reference bodyweight support","timeFrame":"Appointment 3 (between minute 25 and minute 55 )"},{"measure":"Leg joint angles","description":"Joint angles recorded with electrogoniometers during at least 20 steps for each of the following conditions: Andago with reference bodyweight support; Andago with 15% more bodyweight support; Andago with 30% more bodyweight support; and treadmill condition with reference bodyweight support","timeFrame":"Appointment 3 (between minute 25 and minute 55)"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bodyweight unloading [kg]","description":"Comparison of bodyweight unloading according to Andago device compared to actual bodyweight unloading measured with scales \\[kg\\]","timeFrame":"Data are obtained during Appointment 2 (between minute 1 and minute 10)"},{"measure":"Number of device stops","description":"Number of Andago device stops measured throughout the habituation periods during appointments 1 and 2","timeFrame":"Data are obtained during Appointment 1 between minute 25 and minute 45 and Appointment 2 between minute 10 to 30"},{"measure":"Customized questionnaire investigating acceptability [dichotomous]","description":"Participant is being asked whether the patient prefers treadmill or Andago (dichotomous outcome: 0=treadmill/1=Andago), and if the patient would like to train again in the Andago (0=no/1=yes).
