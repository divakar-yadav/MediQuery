This robotic system has been developed to facilitate functional motor recovery by practices walking with a one joint motor powered exoskeleton to reduce the muscle weakness in the shank and reduce the hyperextension in the knee joint. The robotic knee system is able to sense the gait pattern from the stroke patients and assist the walking and control the knee angle. The clinical trial will use repeated measurements to evaluate the effectiveness of the robotic knee system in gait rehabilitation post stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Knee robot","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This robotic system has been developed to facilitate functional motor recovery by practices walking with a one joint motor powered exoskeleton","interventionNames":["Device: Knee robot"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Knee robot","armGroupLabels":["Knee robot"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Category","description":"Patients can be rated on the following categories:\n\n0: Patient cannot walk, or needs help from 2 or more persons\n\n1.
