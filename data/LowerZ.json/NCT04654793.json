In the experimental group, FES was performed at the same time as the robot-assisted inclined bed treatment once a day for 30 minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks, and the control group performed conventional inclined bed treatment for 30 minutes once a day for 4 weeks, 5 days a week. Separately from this in all groups, functional electrical stimulation treatment is performed once a day in the area except the lower extremities. In addition, all patients receive palliative physical therapy for 4 weeks for 1 hour a day. All subjects undergo a physical examination and whole body composition assessment before and after 4 weeks of treatment, and f/u after 4 weeks of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Robot assisted inclined bed treatment and FES","interventionNames":["Device: Robot assisted inclined bed treatment and FES"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"conventional inclined bed treatment","interventionNames":["Device: conventional inclined bed treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot assisted inclined bed treatment and FES","description":"FES was performed at the same time as the robot-assisted inclined bed treatment once a day for 30 minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"conventional inclined bed treatment","description":"conventional inclined bed treatment for 30 minutes once a day for 4 weeks, 5 days a week","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (lower)","description":"A tool used to evaluate motor dysfunction, movement of the agonist and collaborator muscles, and coordination in stroke patients.
