The subjects will be divided into 2 groups: 1) Nintendo Wii and conventional physical therapy 2) control group which will have conventional physical therapy applied. There will be 2 treatment sessions during 4 weeks, with evaluations before the study and after 4 weeks, which include: functional capability (Timed up and go test), gait and balance performance (Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment and Berg balance scale), motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer assessment), daily living activities (Barthel Index) and complex activities (Frenchay activity index).","detailedDescription":"Introduction. Stroke is one of the most common causes of acquired adult disability. Much of the focus of stroke rehabilitation, in particular, the work of physiotherapists, is focused on recovery of physical independence and functional ability during activities of daily living. Physiotherapy based on conventional therapy has been shown to produce good results in recovery progress after stroke. However, patients tend to find the movements involved in this treatment as difficult and monotonous over time. Virtual rehabilitation is a novel therapeutic intervention based on simulation exercises using virtual reality technology.\n\nObjective. The main objective of the present study was to assess whether a virtual rehabilitation program added to a conventional physical therapy intervention results in greater improvements in functional capability, gait, balance and daily activities compared to conventional physical therapy intervention on its own.\n\nMaterial and Methods Sample: men and women aged 18 to 80 years having had a first simple stroke Study design. Randomized clinical trial with 2 groups: Group 1. 1) Nintendo Wii and conventional physical therapy 2) control group which will have conventional physical therapy applied.\n\nEvaluations. Clinical interview with anthropometric data. There will be 2 evaluations: at the beginning of the study and at the end of the intervention (at 4 weeks).\n\nIn addition, it includes the following evaluation instruments:\n\n* Functional capability: Timed up and go test (TUG)\n* Gait and balance performance: Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA) and Berg balance scale (BBS)\n* Motor impairment: Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA)\n* Daily living activities: Barthel Index.\n* Complex activities: Frenchay activity index (FAI)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","virtual reality","physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nintendo Wii and conventional physical therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group of patients will receive, in addition to the exercise program described below, a virtual rehabilitation program through Nintendo Wii.

The subject wears his/her usual footwear and walking aids (cane or walker) if necessary.

It consists of sixteen situations divided into two blocks that require the active participation of the patient. One block assesses gait, in which the subject walks with the examiner first with his usual step, returning with a fast but safe step (using his usual walking aids) with a maximum possible score of 12 points; and the other block assesses balance (in seating, standing and transferring from one to another) with a maximum of 16 points being obtained. The maximum overall score between the two blocks is 28 points.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"The Berg Balance Scale (BBS)","description":"The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a 14-item scale that quantitatively evaluates equilibrium (static and dynamic) and fall risk.
