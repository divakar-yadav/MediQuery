The proximal priority and distal priority robotic priming techniques may bring differential effects. This proposed research project aims to: (1) examine the effects of proximal priority versus distal priority of bilateral robotic priming combined with exergaming on sensorimotor function, daily function, self-efficacy, quality of life, and motor control strategy in patients with stroke, (2) investigate the 3-month retention effects of the three approaches, and (3) identify the potential predictors of functionally relevant changes after therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"proximal-prioritized robotic practice plus kinetic exergaming group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"60 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic practice","Other: kinetic exergaming"]},{"label":"distal-prioritized robotic practice plus kinetic exergaming group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"60 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic practice","Other: kinetic exergaming"]},{"label":"robotic practice plus conventional therapy group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"60 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic practice","Other: conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"robotic practice","description":"According to the group assignment, participants will start from the BMT proximal mode (i.e., forearm pronation-supination movement), and then the distal mode (i.e., wrist flexion-extension movement), and vice versa.

The maximum score is 66, with a subscale score of 42 for the proximal part of the arms (shoulder/elbow) and 24 for the distal part of the arm (wrist/hand/coordination)\n4.
