The proximal priority and distal priority robotic priming techniques may bring differential effects. This proposed research project aims to: (1) examine the effects of proximal priority versus distal priority of bilateral robotic priming combined with exergaming on sensorimotor function, daily function, self-efficacy, quality of life, and motor control strategy in patients with stroke, (2) investigate the 3-month retention effects of the three approaches, and (3) identify the potential predictors of functionally relevant changes after therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"proximal-prioritized robotic practice plus kinetic exergaming group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"60 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic practice","Other: kinetic exergaming"]},{"label":"distal-prioritized robotic practice plus kinetic exergaming group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"60 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic practice","Other: kinetic exergaming"]},{"label":"robotic practice plus conventional therapy group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"60 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic practice","Other: conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"robotic practice","description":"According to the group assignment, participants will start from the BMT proximal mode (i.e., forearm pronation-supination movement), and then the distal mode (i.e., wrist flexion-extension movement), and vice versa.

The protocol will include affected arm exercise or gross motor training, muscle strengthening of the affected arm, fine motor or dexterity training, and functional tasks of daily life or compensatory techniques to alleviate functional deficits.

The maximum score is 66, with a subscale score of 42 for the proximal part of the arms (shoulder/elbow) and 24 for the distal part of the arm (wrist/hand/coordination)\n4.
