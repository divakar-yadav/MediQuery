The main question it aims to answer is: 1) How does blood flow restricted high-intensity treadmill training impact walking function? Participants will be separated into two groups and asked to walk on the treadmill for 75 minutes weekly. Only one group will experience blood flow restriction on their affected leg while walking on the treadmill. Researchers will then compare both groups to see if blood flow restriction training changes walking function, strength, and balance in this population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Ambulation Disorder, Neurologic","Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Blood Flow Restriction Training","BFR","BFRt","High Intensity Treadmill Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A Randomized Case Control Cohort Study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Interventional Cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Blood Flow Restricted High Intensity Treadmill Training at 70% limb occlusion 2x weekly for 16 Sessions totaling a minimum of 75 minutes weekly.","interventionNames":["Other: Blood Flow Restricted High Intensity Treadmill Training"]},{"label":"Control Cohort","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"High-Intensity Treadmill Training 2x weekly for 16 Sessions totaling a minimum of 75minutes weekly.","interventionNames":["Other: HITT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Blood Flow Restricted High Intensity Treadmill Training","description":"Blood Flow Restricted High Intensity Treadmill Training at 70% limb occlusion (on hemiparetic limb only) 2x weekly for 16 Sessions totaling minimum of 75 minutes weekly.","armGroupLabels":["Interventional Cohort"],"otherNames":["BFR-HITT"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"HITT","description":"High Intensity Treadmill Training 2x weekly for 16 Sessions totaling minimum of 75minutes weekly.","armGroupLabels":["Control Cohort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 Minute Walk Test","description":"The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) assesses distance walked over 6 minutes as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity/endurance.","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 4 (up to one week), Week 8( up to one week)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 Meter Walk Test","description":"The 10MWT assesses walking speed in meters per second over a short duration.","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 4 (up to one week), Week 8( up to one week)"},{"measure":"5 Time Sit to Stand","description":"The Five Times Sit to Stand Test measures one aspect of transfer skill.
