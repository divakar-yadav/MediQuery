Improved recovery will be measured through the proportion of patients reaching a FAC score of 4 or higher at the end of the intervention period. The tested hypothesis is that this proportion will be higher in the Exo group.\n\nThe duration of the intervention period in both groups is 6 weeks.\n\n* For the Exo group: 3 sessions per week (i.e., 18 one-hour sessions) with the Atalante device and 2 sessions per week (i.e., 12 one-hour sessions) of conventional therapy.\n* For the Control group: 5 sessions per week of conventional therapy (i.e., 30 one-hour sessions).\n\nThe study will include 66 patients (33 in each arm) and takes place in two French centers, two German centers and one Spanish center."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Subacute","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Cerebrovascular Accident","Hemiparesis","Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA","Hemiparesis/Hemiplegia (One Sided Weakness/Paralysis)"],"keywords":["Robotics","Rehabilitation","Powered Exoskeleton","Walking recovery","Stroke","Acute stroke","Subacute stroke","Functional Ambulation Category","Randomized controlled study"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Single blind","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exo group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"During the 6-week intervention period, the Exo group will complete 3 sessions per week (i.e., 18 one-hour sessions) with the Atalante device and 2 sessions per week (i.e., 12 one-hour sessions) of conventional therapy.\n\nDuring sessions with the exoskeleton, the patient will perform ambulatory exercises with the device, with a gradual increase of intensity through the sessions.\n\nConventional therapy corresponds to physiotherapy as part of post stroke standard of care of the center (tasks such as lower and upper limb practice, walking in parallel bars, etc., but this list is not exhaustive and depends on the practice of the therapists/centers).","interventionNames":["Device: Use of the Atalante exoskeleton"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"During the 6-week intervention period, the Control group will complete 5 sessions per week of conventional therapy (i.e., 30 one-hour sessions)."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Use of the Atalante exoskeleton","description":"Six weeks of exoskeleton sessions replacing conventional therapy sessions three times a week","armGroupLabels":["Exo group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking recovery expressed by the proportion of patients reaching a Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) score of 4 or higher at the end of the intervention period, assessed without the exoskeleton.","description":"The FAC is a 6-item ordinal scale that classifies the level of support needed to walk safely, irrespective of the use of a lower extremity orthosis or walking aid, ranging from 0 (unable to walk without the assistance of two people) to 5 (independent walking on uneven surfaces and on stairs).","timeFrame":"End of the intervention period (week 6)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking recovery expressed by the proportion of patients reaching a FAC score of 4 or higher at six months post stroke, assessed without the exoskeleton.","timeFrame":"6 months post stroke"},{"measure":"Time to reach FAC score of 4 or higher","timeFrame":"Day 1 (± 3 days), week 2 (± 3 days) and week 4 (± 3 days) after the beginning of the intervention period, end of the intervention period (Week 6 ± 3 days), discharge from hospital and 6 months post stroke (± 6 days)."},{"measure":"Change in walking speed measured with the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT)","description":"The 10MWT is used to assess gait speed in meters/second over a short distance.
