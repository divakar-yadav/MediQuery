The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at study completion. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.\n\nThis test will be administered while wearing a portable gas analysis system called the Cosmed K4B2 to measure oxygen consumption. This system measures oxygen consumption (VO2) and Carbon-dioxide production (VCO2) in a breath by breath fashion.","timeFrame":"Aim 2: Baseline pre-intervention, 4 weeks into the intervention, immediately post intervention and 3 months post intervention for intervention 1 and 2."},{"measure":"Change in 10 Meter Walk Test","description":"This test will examine the patient's gait speed.

Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk the entire distance and past the end line approximately 1 meter. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration.
