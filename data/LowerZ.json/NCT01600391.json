Stroke participants recruited from NHS stroke rehabilitation clinics in the West Midlands, will be randomized to one of three gait rehabilitation groups. Each group will receive the same frequency and duration of treatment delivered by qualified physiotherapists. Overground visual cue training (OVCT) and usual care (UC) groups will be treated in participating NHS sites. Treadmill training with visual cues (TVCT) will take place at the University of Birmingham.","detailedDescription":"The gait of many stroke patients remains impoverished and characterized by impairments including asymmetries in propulsive forces between the paretic and non-paretic limbs, step lengths, widths and stance and swing phase durations. Currently there is insufficient evidence that current rehabilitation strategies improve walking in people who are more than 6 months post-stroke.\n\nThe purpose of the trial is to determine the necessary information on which to base a future definitive trial examining the effectiveness of visual cues for gait training following stroke in contrast to conventional over-ground walking practice.\n\nThe study will determine the numbers of patients willing to be recruited into both control and VCT groups; the willingness of physiotherapists at each collaborating site to enroll patients to usual care OVCT and TVCT groups.\n\nIt will determine the numbers of patients who do not complete the allocated treatment, thus dropping out of the study, and the reasons for dropping out.\n\nThe knowledge gathered about recruitment, outcomes and drop-out rates will determine sample size for a subsequent definitive trial.\n\nThe study will also measure completeness of outcome data, i.e. percentage of patients with no missing values in outcome assessments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Visual cues","Gait rehabilitation","Walking adaptability","Turning","Overground walking","Treadmill training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A task specific-based intervention that does not include use of visual cues to influence quality or adaptability of gait.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Usual care"]},{"label":"Overground visual cue training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Overground visual cue training will involve stepping to targets which are positioned to improve gait symmetry and speed.
