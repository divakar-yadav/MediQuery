For example, training has led to substantial recovery if initiated 5 or 14, but not 30 days post-stroke in a rodent model (Biernaski 2004). It is suggested that this early period is characterized by heightened levels of plasticity and that training can exploit this leading to improved outcome. The typically observed non-linear recovery pattern in stroke survivors (Kwakkel 2004) might suggest that similar mechanisms are induced in the human brain, however clinical research on this is disappointingly sparse.\n\nIn two closely inter-related phases, we aim to examine the biomechanical changes related to walking recovery in general (Phase I) and the specific effects of robot-assisted training (Phase II). By that, we aim to detect a time window in stroke survivors which resembles the same characteristics as observed in animal models. To initiate gait training at an early stage, when patients usually present severe weakness and balance deficits, a mobile exoskeleton is used which is developed to provide intensive walking practice.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n(I.a) Is there a distinct time window of behavioral restitution (i.e., returning towards pre-stroke movement patterns) underlying early walking recovery?\n\n(I.b) Are improvements in standing and walking throughout the first 6 months post-stroke explained by behavioral restitution or learning to use compensation strategies?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Paresis","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["walking","recovery","compensation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"conventional rehabilitation","description":"The investigated cohort will be exposed to 'standard care' including conventional rehabilitation therapy."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Categories","description":"This scale indicates the ability to walk independently and serves as the primary outcome measure.","timeFrame":"12 weeks post-stroke]"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Trunk Control Test - item sitting balance","description":"Sitting balance is part of the prognostic model used to stratify patients at baseline.\n\nScoring: 0 - 1 (able to sit independently without support of the legs or trunk 30 seconds)","timeFrame":"Baseline (0-1 week post-stroke)"},{"measure":"Motricity Index - subscale lower limb","description":"Strength of major muscle groups of the paretic lower limb is assessed.
