Our long-term working hypothesis is that an effective solution for increasing rehabilitation access in Botswana and improving functional outcomes of PLHIV having experienced a stroke with or without HIV uses an affordable robot and mobile health technologies to create a cost-effective intervention strategy. For this project, we test the feasibility of affordable robot therapy.","detailedDescription":"We will test the feasibility of affordable robot therapy in three Aims. In Aim 1, we will optimize for the Botswana context, an affordable technology-based robot system with four exercise stations. We will optimize a prototype of our provisionally patented robot gym system, REHAB CARES, for therapy. Optimization will include increasing cost-effectiveness, utilizing more local resources and manufacturing, and using mobile health android platforms for games and data acquisition. In Aim 2, the efficiency of the newly modified robot system compared to standard of care will be assessed using 30 patients who have experienced a stroke, with or without HIV, will be recruited from those who are being treated by Princess Marina Hospital (PMH) and living in the surrounding community. They will receive therapy using the robot gym system and receive standard of care. We will assess functional outcomes including motor impairment, function, and quality of life. The study outcomes would then inform rehabilitation practices for PLHIV with stroke, with or without HIV, and suggest that affordable technology-mediated rehabilitation can reduce their motor dysfunction and resulting long-term disability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["HIV/AIDS","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Low-to-mid functioning HIV/AIDS patients with stroke co-morbidity.
