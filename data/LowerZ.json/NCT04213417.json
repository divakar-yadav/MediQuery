In this context,to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study on this subject. The results of the study will develop a new perspective for management of spasticity and will ensure more common use of MRT.Further studies are needed on superiority of MRI over other treatment methods used in gait and balance rehabilitation of hemiparetic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of combining Bobath therapy (BT) and MRT on muscle tone,balance and gait parameters in stroke individuals with spastic hemiparesis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke survivor","spasticity","Matrix Rhythm Therapy","balance","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bobath therapy plus Matrix Rhythm Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MRT application that was applied to the study group in addition to the Bobath therapy was applied to the affected side of the body and lower extremity for 60 minutes in each session.","interventionNames":["Other: Bobath therapy and Matrix Rhythm Therapy"]},{"label":"Bobath therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Both groups were treated with the Bobath therapy as a neurodevelopmental therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Bobath therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bobath therapy and Matrix Rhythm Therapy","description":"MRT application that was applied to the study group in addition to the BC was applied to the affected side of the body and lower extremity for 60 minutes in each session.The treatment was started from the thoracic region and a treatment direction was toward the lower extremity in the affected side.During the MRT procedure, the patient's active participation was ensured and the treatment was combined with the exercises.The patients were informed about MRT verbally and in writing before the application.

In various studies, \"0,1,2,3,4,5\"scoring is used for MAS. \"0\" means no increase in muscle tone. \"5\" means affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension. The validity and reliability of this scoring method in hemiparetic individuals have been shown with different studies.The spasticity values of quadriceps femoris muscle, hip adductor muscles, and gastrocnemius muscles in hemiparetic lower extremities of the participants were recorded. In addition, the total MAS score was determined in the affected lower extremity by summing up all values.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"The Single Leg Stance Test","description":"Evaluation of static balance: The Single Leg Stance Test (SLST) from Transitions/Anticipatory Postural Adjustments section, one of the BESTest Balance Evaluation System sub-parameters, was used.While SLST is performed, the patient's stance times on the right and left legs were recorded. During the test, a scoring between 0 and 3 was made according to whether or not the stability of two extremities could be maintained.The highest score a patient could receive was 6. Receiving a high score from four tests indicates that upright position was maintained.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Timed \"Get Up & Go\" Test","description":"Evaluation of dynamic balance: The Timed \"Get Up \\& Go\" Test(TUG) from Stability in Gait section, one of the BESTest Balance Evaluation System sub-parameters, was used.The test started while the patient was sitting on a chair. Three meters from the chair was marked with colored tapes. The person was asked to stand up from chair,walk 3 meters forward,turn 180°,and walk back to the chair and sit on the chair.The completion time of the test was recorded in seconds. A scoring between 0-3 was made according to whether or not the balance is maintained during the test. Getting a high score from the test indicated good balance.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Evaluation of Spatio-Temporal Parameters of Gait","description":"BTS G-Walk Spatio-temporal gait analysis system was used to evaluate gait parameters. Measurements were made in a pre-determined walking area of 10 m.In BTS G-Walk gait analysis system, the results are transferred via Bluetooth to the computer using an analysis port(sensor) connected to L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels of the patient.With the BTS G-Walk system,all important information such as spatio-temporal parameters of gait, general gait kinematics,pelvis, and spine kinematics can be reached.While this system compares the left and right extremities of the person with normal values during gait analysis,it also allows kinematic analysis of the pelvis to be performed in three planes.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of Joint Range of Motion","description":"Joint Range of Motion (ROM) was measured to determine active and passive joint motion limitation that spasticity can cause in muscle structure and secondarily in joint structure.
