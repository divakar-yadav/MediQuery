For example, training has led to substantial recovery if initiated 5 or 14, but not 30 days post-stroke in a rodent model (Biernaski 2004). It is suggested that this early period is characterized by heightened levels of plasticity and that training can exploit this leading to improved outcome. The typically observed non-linear recovery pattern in stroke survivors (Kwakkel 2004) might suggest that similar mechanisms are induced in the human brain, however clinical research on this is disappointingly sparse.\n\nIn two closely inter-related phases, we aim to examine the biomechanical changes related to walking recovery in general (Phase I) and the specific effects of robot-assisted training (Phase II). By that, we aim to detect a time window in stroke survivors which resembles the same characteristics as observed in animal models. To initiate gait training at an early stage, when patients usually present severe weakness and balance deficits, a mobile exoskeleton is used which is developed to provide intensive walking practice.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n(II.a) Are stroke survivors who train with the assistance of a robot at an early stage more likely to achieve independent walking?\n\n(II.b) Does additional robot-assisted training modulate the recovery of standing and walking ability by enhancing behavioral restitution?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Paresis","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomly assigned to either the \"early group\" or \"delayed group\".
