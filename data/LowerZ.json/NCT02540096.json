Searching for more affordable treatment options, several studies suggest the use of mental practice with motor imagery as a potential therapeutic tool, since it can be performed at any place or any time the patient wishes, including their own homes.\n\nMotor imagery can be defined as the covert cognitive process of imagining a movement of your own body(-part) without actually moving that body(-part).\n\nWithin this context, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of mental practice for mobility, gait function and speed and muscle strength of the lower limb in subacute post-stroke hemiparesis.","detailedDescription":"Post-stroke patients will be invited to participate after hospital discharge, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, after acceptance, participants will be randomized (block strategy) into two groups: Control group (Physiotherapy and Cognitive mental exercise) and Intervention group (Physiotherapy and Mental Practice group).\n\nAt baseline, 4 weeks (end of intervention) and 6 weeks, participants will be evaluated through the following tests: Timed-Up and Go test, 5-Meter Walk Test, TUG-ABS, WHOQOL-Bref, DASS-21 and muscle strength."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["mental practice","motor imagery","hemiparesis","stroke","gait","mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention (Mental Practice)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be submitted to individual and structured physiotherapy sessions (the same as the control groups).
