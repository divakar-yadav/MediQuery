People who have had a stroke have a higher risk of falling than people who have not had a stroke at the same age. Lack of balance control not only increases the risk of falling, but also leads to fear of falling and reduces the integration of people with stroke into society.\n\nThe central nervous system uses two main postural strategies to maintain and restore balance when perturbed. These; are anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments. Anticipatory postural adjustments control the position of the body's center of mass by activating the trunk and leg muscles prior to a forthcoming body perturbation, thus minimizing the risk of loosing equilibrium. Compensatory postural adjustment are initiated by sensory feedback signals and serve as a mechanism of restoration of the position of the center of mass after a perturbation has already occurred.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aimed to determine which one is more effective, unlike previous studies that showed that internal and external perturbation exercises were effective when applied together. For this purpose, the researchers the planned to investigate and compare the effects on balance, performance, activity and participation in individuals to whom only internal perturbations were applied and only external perturbations were applied.\n\nThe participants will be divided into 2 groups, as Group A and Group B, with 10 participants in each group, in a randomized controlled manner.\n\nTreatment Protocol:\n\nConventional treatment was applied to participants included in both groups for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, 40-minute sessions. In addition to conventional treatment, 30 minutes of perturbation-based balance training was given to the participant in the study. Participants in Group A received internal perturbation training, and participants in Group B received external perturbation training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Internal perturbation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The people included in this group did 6 internal perturbation exercises with 10 repetitions in each session.

It evaluates the body's ability to maintain position during 14 different activities in which the support surface decreases and the center of gravity changes, by observation. It is scored between 0-4 points, while at 0 the activity cannot be completed, at 4 it is completed independently. The total score is 56. If the score obtained at the end of the test is between 0-20, it is interpreted as poor balance skills, between 21-40 as acceptable balance and between 41-56 as advanced balance skills.","timeFrame":"baseline and 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in balance on the Timed Up and Go Test at 4 weeks","description":"For the timed up and go test, the patient gets up from the chair without arm support, walks 3 meters, returns and sits back in the chair. The total time it takes to complete the test is recorded in seconds using a stopwatch. The evaluation results are valid as they include maneuvers used in daily life. Individuals with independent balance and mobility skills complete the test in less than 10 seconds, individuals who complete it in more than 30 seconds are dependent on many activities and mobility skills in daily life.","timeFrame":"baseline and 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in balance 10-meter Walking Test at 4 weeks","description":"In this test, the person is asked to walk at his own normal pace in a pre-measured 10-meter area.
