Conventional gait training is offered to both study groups.\n\nTraining with HAL is performed in 1 session per day, 4 days per week during 4 weeks. Time for each session is individualised but does not exceed 60 minutes/session (effective time). Training with HAL is performed in combination with body-weight support system and on a treadmill.
