The subjects who received scores of 7 or more in the Hodkinson Mental Test and 3 and above in the Functional Ambulation Classification with subjects who gastrocnemius muscle spasticity 2 and below points according to Modified Ashworth Scale were included in the study. The walking parameters of the participants were evaluated with the BTS G-Walk Spatio-Temporal Walking Analysis System. The walking parameters of the participants who were selected by randomization method were evaluated separately by applying kinesiological taping and sham taping or without any taping or interference on a 10 meter track."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Kinesiological Taping","Walking","Tibialis Anterior"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Sham Controlled Study","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Original kinesiological tape was applied to the participants.

Kinesiological banding for the tibialis anterior muscle was performed using muscle technique (stimulation). The taping was performed with the patients lying on a stretcher in the supine position. The kinesiological band was cut in the shape of I considering the participant's muscle length, the edges were ovalized, and the skin was purified from moisture, hair and oil. While applying the muscle technique (stimulation), the tibialis anterior muscle was stretched in the plantar flexion and eversion position. It was then activated by applying heat along the band. After the band was activated, the walking parameters of the participant were measured again with the BTS G-Walk device.","timeFrame":"2 hours"},{"measure":"With sham taping walking parameter measurement","description":"The sham taping was applied to the participants a week or a week before the application of the kinesiological tape.
