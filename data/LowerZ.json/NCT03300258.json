Forty (40) adult stroke patients and 80 healthy controls will be enrolled in this study. Of the 40 patients, half will be randomly assigned to the robotically-targeted training (\"robotic\") group and will receive training on the targeted training task. The other half of the patients will perform a duration-matched aerobic pedaling exercise (\"control\" group). All stroke patients will be scanned before and after their training program while performing or imagining simple motor tasks. Behavioral assessments of motor and cognitive capacities will be collected at each timepoint. Healthy control subjects enrolled for device testing (20) will receive up to 5 training sessions in a modified robotic paradigm and 1 fMRI scan, in order to investigate motor learning and brain activity in a novel motor control task. Additional healthy pilot subjects (up to 60) will test training protocols and assessments during preparatory design phases of the project."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non-Stroke Pilot Group","type":"OTHER","description":"Robotic therapy.
