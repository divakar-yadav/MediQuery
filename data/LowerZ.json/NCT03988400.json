One factor contributing to these balance deficits is a reduced ability to place the feet appropriately when walking. This study investigates whether enhancing the sensory information available to chronic stroke survivors while they walk improves their foot placement accuracy and balance.","detailedDescription":"The objective of this project is to test a method of providing real-time augmentation of hip proprioceptive feedback during post-stroke walking. The sensory information available to participants will be augmented by providing vibration of the hip abductor musculature that is scaled to the near-real-time mechanical state of their body. The central hypothesis is that augmented proprioception will improve participants' perception of their body's motion, thus increasing the mechanics-dependent modulation of foot placement, an important gait stabilization strategy. This clinical trial will establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a rehabilitation intervention centered on repeated exposure to sensory augmentation during gait. Specifically, participants in the experimental group will complete training sessions twice a week for four weeks in which they receive sensory augmentation during \\~30 minutes of treadmill walking. Participants in the activity-matched control group will perform the same task, except the hip vibration will be randomly delivered, not linked to the body's actual mechanical state. Changes in walking balance and foot placement accuracy will be quantified over the course of the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomly assigned to either an Experimental (n=22) or Control (n=22) group.
