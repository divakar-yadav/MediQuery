It will compare clinical and biomechanical features of patients at baseline and after intervention. Additionally, it will also examine the use of a brain-computer-interface (BCI) to command movements on the powered lower limb exoskeleton. The findings will be used to improve understanding human-robot interaction, to improve the design of the robotic devices and to improve rehabilitation services.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality, morbidity and disability in adults in developed countries. Survivors may suffer several neurological deficits or deficiencies, such as hemiparesis, communication disorders, cognitive deficits and visuospatial perception disorders. Hemiplegia is a par loss of hemi-body voluntary motricity following a brain injury, usually resulting in alterations of the locomotor system with persistent disorders of movement and posture. Hemiplegia significantly affects gait performance. Gait recovery is an important objective in the rehabilitation program for stroke patients.The currently available treatment techniques include classical techniques of gait rehabilitation, functional electrical stimulation, electromechanic devices, robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces, among others.The evidence suggest that the combination of different rehabilitation strategies is more effective than conventional rehabilitation techniques alone. Technology-based rehabilitation methods such as robotic devices need more research to demonstrate their effects on gait recovery.\n\nThis study will assess the effects of a rehabilitation program with a powered lower extremity exoskeleton in people with stroke. Additionally, it will also examine the use of a brain-computer-interface (BCI) to command movements on the powered lower limb exoskeleton. The findings will be used to improve understanding human-robot interaction, to improve the design of the robotic devices and to improve rehabilitation services."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Gait","Brain-Computer Interface","Rehabilitation","Exoskeleton"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-assisted Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Robot-assisted training with a lower extremity powered exoskeleton (H3 Exoskeleton, Spain).
