Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in resistance during a passive stretch due to hyper excitability of stretch reflex. This results in many functional impairments and patients centered problems. Given the complexity of spasticity related issues, its rehabilitation must entail comprehensive approach which address and synchronize spasticity reduction with motor function restoration without compensation. Shock Wave Therapy (SWT) is a non-invasive low cost devise gaining its use for spasticity reduction. After damage brain undergoes some sort of rearrangement. Literature says that during this period if it will rehabilitated through new pattern functional recovery can be optimized. However there is paucity of evidence for effectiveness of multiphasic neuroplasticity based Training protocol (MNTP) with SWT regarding its intensity frequency and specificity for spasticity management.\n\nIt will be a mix method approach. The patients after full filling the inclusion criteria , age ranging between 45 to 65 years having a stroke more than 3 months ago and having problematic spasticity interfering with function or causing a clinical problem, and no contraindications to shock wave therapy Upper or lower limb spasticity MAS ≥ 1 will be randomly assigned into four groups A,B,C,D. All groups will receive conventional rehabilitation training for 30 min per day five times a week for 4 weeks .Moreover patients in group A,BC also receive added SWT, MNTP and a combination of MNTP and SWT respectively. Motor recovery and spasticity will be using clinical (modified Asworth scale, Tardieu scale), neurophysiological, morphological(muscle ultrasound) and functional parameter( Fugl -meyer, burg balance, time up and go, Barthal index, Rivermeads mobility index ) at 0 , 8 and 16 week of treatment. The methodological approach used in this, will encompasses quantitative methods to assess program effectiveness and mixed methods to evaluate rehabilitation program components and aspects of protocol implementation. Qualitative methodology is needed to capture the range of participant experiences in the real- life clinical setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity, Muscle"],"keywords":["Neuroplasticity,","Exercise","Stroke","post stroke spasticity","Electromyography","Ultrasonography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Shock wave therapy with multiphasic neuroplasticity based training protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Shock wave therapy with multiphasic neuroplasticity based training protocol based on motor relearning program and task oriented approach","interventionNames":["Other: Shock wave therapy with multiphasic neuroplasticity based training protocol"]},{"label":"Conventional physical therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Stretching and strengthing and motor sensory motor training of effected side","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Shock wave therapy with multiphasic neuroplasticity based training protocol","description":"Interventions program will be based on Activity dependent neuroplasticity targeting relevant impairments included: task specific practice, motor learning, strengthening, postural awareness, Balance training, aerobic and conditioning exercises, range of movement with Shock wave therapy for most of time of the day .","armGroupLabels":["Shock wave therapy with multiphasic neuroplasticity based training protocol"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional physical therapy","description":"The CP program focused on the facilitation of movements on the paretic side, range of motion, stretching exercises, upper and lower limb strengthening exercises, and improving balance, standing, sitting, transferring, patients received a program for at least 30 sessions, 5 times per week for 6 or more weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional physical therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified ashworh scale","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is used to assess spasticity.
