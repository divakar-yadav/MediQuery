Exoskeleton robots appear to provide benefits for stroke patients by providing exercise guidance, thus improving their independent gait endurance and stair climbing ability. For stroke patients who cannot continue to improve through general rehabilitation and have ongoing mobility difficulties, exoskeletons may be a potential solution. However, previous literature on the use of exoskeletons to assist gait training has had mixed results, with one major reason being that the frequency of use is too low or the duration of use is too short, due to the high cost and inconvenience of travel to medical institutions. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to enable patients to use them frequently and for a long period.\n\nMethod: investigators designed a non-blinded, randomized crossover trial to observe the potential benefits of using the device at home for one month. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, one receiving traditional rehabilitation first and the other using the exoskeleton first. There were four time points for testing: before, after the first stage of treatment, after the second stage of treatment, and one month after completing the second stage, to observe the sustained effects.\n\nThe testing involved executing a 6-minute walk test, timed up and go test, and a 10-step stair test (up and down) both with and without the device. An electronic software app was used to record daily usage time to determine the quantity and degree of home use.\n\nAnalysis: Repeated measures ANOVA models were used to analyze the effects and correlations of the experiment. The effects of the duration/frequency of use on dosage were also analyzed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Exoskeleton"],"keywords":["Subacute","Motor function","Robot","Walking assistance","Home mobility aid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FREE Walk Exoskeleton vs Traditional Rehabilitation for Stroke Patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm will receive one month of traditional rehabilitation followed by one month of using the exoskeleton at home.","interventionNames":["Device: FREE Walk Exoskeleton","Other: Traditional Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Traditional Rehabilitation vs FREE Walk Exoskeleton for Stroke Patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Arm Description: Participants in this arm will receive one month of using the exoskeleton at home followed by one month of traditional rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Device: FREE Walk Exoskeleton","Other: Traditional Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"FREE Walk Exoskeleton","description":"Using a robotic exoskeleton to help with lower limb activities that are difficult due to neurological diseases.

The method involves asking the patient to sit on a straight-backed chair, then stand up, walk three meters forward at their usual pace, turn around, and return to sit on the chair. The total time is recorded with a stopwatch. The test is repeated five times.
