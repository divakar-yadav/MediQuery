Postural balance is a critical factor affecting walking and gait performance in the community after stroke. Gait disorders contribute significantly to functional disability in individuals after stroke. These impairments encompass a variety of changes, including muscle weakness in the affected lower limb, resulting in reduced weight bearing on that limb. This results in a slower and less safe gait. Given the impact on gait, functional mobility is also compromised, including daily activities such as sitting, standing, walking, turning and climbing or descending stairs. Proprioception is impaired in a large percentage of individuals following stroke. The presence of proprioception deficits has been identified as an important determinant of unfavourable functional outcomes after stroke, especially in terms of achieving independence in basic activities of daily living and length of hospital stay. In the literature, there are no studies investigating the relationship between ankle position sense and lower extremity functionality with balance and falls using Humac Norm Isokinetic Machine and Tecno Body Prokin Isokinetic Balance System simultaneously."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Being Between 40-80 Years Old","Being Diagnosed With Haemiplegia","Getting 20 Points or More in the Mini Mental Test","Volunteering to Participate in the Study","Level 2 or Above According to Functional Ambulation Classification"],"keywords":["Stroke","Proprioception","Lower limb functionality","Ankle joint","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Humac Norm İsokinetic Machine","description":"Tecno Body Prokin Isokinetic Balance System CSMI (CYBEX) Humac Norm Isokinetic Testing and Exercise System Romberg Test Mini Mental Test (MMSE) Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the lower limb","otherNames":["Tecno Body Prokin Isokinetic Balance System"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tecno Body Prokin Isokinetic Balance System","description":"It expresses the equilibrium rate and the probability of falling.","timeFrame":"First Day"},{"measure":"CSMI (CYBEX) Humac Norm Isokinetic Test and Exercise System","description":"Measures ankle joint position sensation.","timeFrame":"First day"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"It was developed for the evaluation of postural dominance.","timeFrame":"First day"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the lower extremity","description":"Is used for the assessment of motor function after stroke.
