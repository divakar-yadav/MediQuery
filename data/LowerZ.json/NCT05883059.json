The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are: the efficacy of lower limb robot assisted training in improving walking ability, lower limb function, cognition, and quality of life in stroke patients.The robot group of patients received lower limb robot assisted training combined with routine rehabilitation treatment. The control group only received routine rehabilitation treatment.Compare two groups to explore the therapeutic effect of lower limb robots on lower limb dysfunction after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"assessor was blinded.
