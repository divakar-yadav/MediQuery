In the sub-acute phase, it is difficult to implement a strengthening program, as weakness prevents exercise being performed with the recommended parameters. This limit can be exceeded by using specific robotic devices, which allow the effort provided to be adapted according to the patient's capacities. In addition, motivation can be improved by the use of feedback or incentive games. The aim of this pilot study is to obtain data on the effect of lower limb strength training with a seated robotic device in subacute ABI patients for a future larger randomised study. In addition, it aims to evaluate the recruitment rate, applicability, resources for implementation and patient tolerance to the training program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["lower limb","robotic device","strength training","subacute","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"group focus on lower limb strength training with a seated robotic device","interventionNames":["Device: Group of strength training"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"physiotherapy group as usual, not focused on strength training","interventionNames":["Other: Group of physiotherapy not focus on strength training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Group of strength training","description":"2x a week during 5 weeks, strengthening of weak muscles with the intensity recommended in the literature, i.e. 3-4x15 repetition at an intensity of 50 to 80% of the maximum force combined with serious games to stimulate patient involvement in strength training","armGroupLabels":["intervention group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Group of physiotherapy not focus on strength training","description":"2x a week during 5 weeks, active physical therapy treatment based on movement","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change from study inclusion to end of intervention at 5 weeks in strength of knee extensor's","description":"measure with a manuel dynamometer, in newton","timeFrame":"Study inclusion to end of intervention at 5 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change from study inclusion to end of intervention at 5 weeks in Motricity index legs","description":"clinical manuel strength test, seating on a chair.
