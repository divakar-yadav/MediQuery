A higher score is interpreted as having higher independence of walking, and a score of 3 or less is considered difficult to move independently. It is a tool to evaluate not only balance ability but also actual mobility ability.","timeFrame":"baseline and week 4"},{"measure":"Korean version of Modified Barthel Index","description":"The Korean version of Modified Barthel Index(K-MBI) is a tool to evaluate the patient's level of independence in daily living activities, including basic daily living activities and instrumental daily living activities. It consists of 5 to 15 points depending on the item, and the perfect score is 100 points. The higher the score, the higher the patient's level of independence from daily activities is considered.","timeFrame":"baseline and week 4"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment(L/E)","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment(FMA)(L/E) is an exercise ability scale to evaluate the motor function of stroke patients, and it is a tool to evaluate motor function of the healthy and injured upper and lower limbs.
