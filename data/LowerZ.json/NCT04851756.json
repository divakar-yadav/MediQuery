It is the most common feature after stroke, which most affects motor and functional recovery.\n\nSpasticity prevalence runs from 25% to 46% after the first six months post-stroke, and it is estimated that 16% will require treatment.\n\nSpasticity has neural (increased reflex activity) and biomechanical (altered viscoelastic properties due to immobilization) components. The initial paralysis after stroke modifies the bio mechanical properties of the muscle, thus shortening its fibers and causing an increase of velocity-dependent reflexes in the affected area. Spasticity manifests with paresis, increased muscle tone, muscular hyperactivity, decreased range of movement and pain.\n\nGait disorder is one of the main physical limitations in stroke survivors and an important target for stroke rehabilitation, since physiotherapy treatments of spasticity aim to decrease excessive muscular tone, ease mobility, give the patient the sense of right position and avoid joint limitations.\n\nFunctional Massage (F.M) is a non-invasive manual therapy technique that combines rhythmical passive mobilizations of the joints with gentle massage and compression of the muscles to be treated. As massage therapy is effective to improve spastic muscles and gross motor functions, F.M may be appropriate in treating post stroke spasticity and gait function. No studies were found on its effectiveness in patients with post-stroke spasticity.\n\nCapacitive Resistive electric transfer therapy (CRet) is a non-invasive diathermy technique that, providing high frequency energy (300KHz-1.2MHz),generates a thermal effect on soft tissues. CRet is used to facilitate tissue regeneration, and it does not need a surface-cooling system as its wave frequency is lower than in conservative diathermy. Its effectiveness has been evaluated in several studies related to musculoskeletal disorders, where an increase in temperature is needed in deep tissues in order to generate changes on its viscoelasticity.\n\nThis effect may be beneficial in the spasticity treatment since spasticity onset and development may be affected by structural changes in muscular and tendinous fibers, as well as in its intra and extracellular components.\n\nNo studies on the effects of CRet in post-stroke spasticity treatment were found."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae","Spasticity, Muscle","Massage","Electrotherapy"],"keywords":["Stroke","Spasticity","Functional Massage","CRet","Functionality","Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CRet Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"30 min CRet with F.M on the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis","interventionNames":["Device: CRet"]},{"label":"CRet Sham Group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"30 min CRet with F.M on the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis with turned on CRet device at power 0","interventionNames":["Device: Sham CRet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"CRet","description":"In prone position, subjects will get a 7 min preparation massage with CRet on resistive mode (80-100W), on the lumbar area, followed by a 5 min preparation massage with CRet on resistive mode (100-120 W) on the hamstrings.
