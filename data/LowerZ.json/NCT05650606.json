Following stroke, over half of Medicare patients are discharged to post-acute care facilities or receive home-based health care (Tsao 2022). Inpatient rehabilitation guidelines are lacking, with many interventions based on research of patients with chronic stroke. There is great need for randomized clinical trials during the early subacute period (Bernhardt 2017, Jordan 2021).\n\nClinical practice guidelines recommend high intensity gait training (HIGT) for ambulatory patients with chronic stroke (Hornby 2020). Outpatient HIGT protocols incorporating variable stepping demonstrate equivalent effectiveness to forward stepping protocols (Hornby 2019) and have yielded superior results to lower intensity therapies (Hornby 2019, Hornby 2016). Research suggests that HIGT with variable stepping is feasible during inpatient rehabilitation (Hornby 2015, Moore 2020). Pre-post studies suggest that participation in HIGT during inpatient rehabilitation yields greater improvements in walking without an increase in adverse events. (Moore 2020). Despite this, there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating HIGT in the inpatient setting.\n\nThe subacute phase of stroke recovery may be a critical time for neuroplasticity (Dromerick 2021). Not only might rehabilitation interventions be more effective when initiated earlier (Biernaskie 2004, Dromerick 2021) but because inpatient rehabilitation represents the transition from hospital to home, interventions during this timeframe have the potential to improve discharge disposition, enhance quality of life, and reduce utilization of post-discharge services.\n\nIn this randomized controlled study, investigators will determine how participation in HIGT during inpatient rehabilitation affects balance, ambulation, and quality of life after 14 and/or 21 days of inpatient rehabilitation, and 8 weeks post-discharge. Investigators will also determine if HIGT reduces health care burden with a cost-effectiveness analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Vascular Accident"],"keywords":["High Intensity Gait Training","Inpatient Rehabilitation","Health Care Burden"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Intensity Gait Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"HIGT will be performed 4-6 times per week in place of conventional physical therapy. The patient's heart rate(HR)and blood pressure(BP) will be measured throughout each session. If the HR or BP is out of the acceptable range, patients will undergo standard physical therapy for that session, and the medical team will be contacted.\n\nTarget HR zones will be calculated with the Karvonen formula. The first session goal is to reach a target HR range that is 50-60% of heart rate reserve. The goal for subsequent sessions is to reach 70-80% of heart rate reserve. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) will also be utilized.\n\nThe primary therapist will design an individualized HIGT treatment program with a combination of speed dependent treadmill activities, activity-based treadmill activities, stair training, and over ground activities.\n\nThe patient will be reminded during each session to ask for a rest as needed. Standing rests are preferred over sitting rests, but either may be utilized.","interventionNames":["Other: High Intensity Gait Training"]},{"label":"Conventional","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The conventional physical therapy sessions are what a patient would normally receive during their rehabilitation.
