Virtual reality (VR) has proved to be a valuable tool to improve neurorehabilitation training. Our pilot randomized clinical trial aimed at evaluating the correlation between the modifications of brain oscillations during a VR neurorehabilitative training of gait and the motor function recovery in patients with chronic stroke.\n\nTwenty-four patients suffering from a first unilateral ischemic stroke in the chronic phase were randomized into two groups. One group performed 40 sessions of Lokomat with VR (RAGT+VR) whereas the other group underwent Lokomat without VR (RAGT-VR). Outcomes (clinical, kinematic, and event-related synchronization, ERS, and desynchronization, ERD, at the EEG) were measured before and after the robotic intervention.\n\nThe robotic-based rehabilitation combined with VR could be associated with improvements in several measurements of lower limb function, gait, and balance in patient with chronic hemiparesis. Moreover, ERS/ERD analysis can be proposed as a tool to monitor motor performance and to develop non-invasive brain-computer interfaces controlling robotic devices."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group performed 40 45-min Lokomat sessions, five times a week, by using a visual feedback showing a Virtual Reality run game where the patient had to collect or avoid objects, to motivate him/her to walk actively.","interventionNames":["Device: Lokomat"]},{"label":"Only RAGT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This groups performed 40 Lokomat sessions (40-45min), five times a week, between 9am and 11am, in this case was not provided an avatar, and a smile indicating the goodness of each leg movement.","interventionNames":["Device: Lokomat"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Lokomat","description":"Both the groups performed 40 45min Lokomat sessions, five times a week, between 9am and 11am.
