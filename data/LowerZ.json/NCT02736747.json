About 60% of the survivors are able to walk following the rehabilitation process, however deficits on lower limbs functions often persists in most cases, affecting the gait and functional mobility. In this sense, several interventions are applied in the clinical practice to optimize the functional performance. Cryotherapy is one of the most used techniques aiming to reduce spasticity temporarily, allowing the training of functional tasks, such as walking. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the immediate effects of cryotherapy (ice pack) on neuromuscular performance, proprioception, passive resistance of dorsiflexors and plantarflexors muscles, and also on gait performance in chronic post-stroke subjects. Eighteen chronic hemiparetic subjects will participate in this crossover placebo-controlled trial. The order of intervention (cryotherapy or placebo) will be randomized. Fifteen days of washout period will be considered. The cryotherapy/placebo will be applied on the posterior area of the leg for 20 minutes. Initially Fugl Meyer will be applied. All other assessments will be performed before and after intervention: spasticity level, classified according to Modified Ashworth Scale; temporo-spatial and angular parameters for trunk, hip, knee and ankle during gait, using a motion analysis system (Qualysis AB, Gothenburg, Sweden); the proprioception (joint position sense), passive resistance to stretching, isometric and isokinetic torques during contractions of plantarflexors and dorsiflexors of the ankle, evaluated through isokinetic dynamometer. Concomitantly, bilateral activation of soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus will be assessed by electromyography during isokinetic dynamometer assessment and gait. The following electromyographic variables will be analyzed: maximum activation amplitude, muscle onset, coactivation index between agonists and antagonists. For statistical analysis, normality (Shapiro Wilk) and homogeneity (Levene) tests will be applied. If the variables have a distribution considered normal and homogeneous, Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures will be applied. Otherwise, non-parametric statistics (Friedman test) will be applied. A significance level of 0.05 will be considered for all statistical tests."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Muscle Spasticity"],"keywords":["Stroke","Muscle Spasticity","Cryotherapy","Gait","Muscle Weakness","Proprioception"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cryotherapy (ice pack)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A pack with 1000g of crushed ice without air will be placed for 20 consecutive minutes on a pre-delimited rectangular area with dimensions of 25 x 35 cm and will be fixed with a non-compressive elastic band.
