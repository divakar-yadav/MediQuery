This single-center randomized parallel-group neurorehabilitation trial with blinded primary outcome assessment is aimed at patients after the first-ever ischaemic stroke in the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation.","detailedDescription":"The main aim is to determine, whether the RAGT by using the Lokomat exoskeleton device (Hoccoma, Switzerland) plus the protocol-defined conventional rehabilitation versus conventional rehabilitation improves the gait of post-stroke patients after 6 months. Both groups are treated with the protocol-defined rehabilitation (ergotherapy and physiotherapy) for 60 min 5 times a week, a total of 15 times within 3 weeks (a total of 1200 min). The Lokowalkers group undergoes the RAGT using the Lokomat Pro Freed device for 20-50 minutes 5 times a week for a total of 15 times for 3 weeks (a total of 1800 minutes). The primary endpoint is the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) after 3 months. Secondary endpoints include FAC (after 15th therapy), 10-meter walk test (10MWT) (after 15th therapy, after 3 months), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) (after 15th therapy and after 3 months, 3-months modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS, after 15th therapy, after 3 months)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["gait","stroke","robotic rehabilitation","exoskeleton","neurorehabilitation","Lokomat"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Single-centre randomized parallel group neurorehabilitation trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lokomat intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized into the Lokomat arm will undergo therapy with Lokomat Pro FreeD for 20-50 minutes 5-times a week, a total of 15-times during the in-hospital stay in a total time of 1,800 minutes.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation","Procedure: Lokomat intervention"]},{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this arm will undergo conventional rehabilitation ((ergotherapy and physiotherapy) for 60 min 5 times a week, a total of 15 times within 3 weeks (a total of 1200 min)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation","Procedure: Leg/lower body exerciser device intervention."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Conventional rehabilitation","description":"Patients will undergo conventional rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Conventional rehabilitation","Lokomat intervention"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Leg/lower body exerciser device intervention.","description":"Patients will undergo leg/lower body exerciser device therapy.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Lokomat intervention","description":"Patients will undergo therapy with Lokomat Pro FreeD device intervention.","armGroupLabels":["Lokomat intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) at 3 months","description":"Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) - the scale range is from 0 to 5.
