These sequelae, generally chronic, generates a significant expense and saturation of social and health services. With the growth in the number of cases, the development of new rehabilitation approaches and updating of the social context becomes pertinent, such as the incorporation of telerehabilitation to assist individuals with stroke.\n\nObjectives: To analyze adherence to physical rehabilitation by mobile App and to evaluate the effectiveness of lumbopelvic stability exercises performed at home with the App.\n\nMaterial and methods: Randomized controlled single blind pilot study (n = 30). Participants with Stroke (\\<6 months) will be randomized between two groups (App for carrying out lumbopelvic stability exercises + usual treatment versus usual treatment). The study will last 3 months and App adherence, Quality Of Life, participation in Daily Life, functionality, sitting balance, standing balance and gait will be taken as variables.\n\nExpected results: It is thought that the use of an App can contribute to rehabilitation in its chronic phase, monitorization and fallow-up the clinical evolution of the patient. Even if chronicity leads us to think about the stabilization of the physical condition, It is thought that the best results will be found among the subjects who will use the App.","detailedDescription":"The recruitment of participants will be done in a personalized way through a verbal invitation from the responsible therapist.\n\nThe therapists of the center will be informed about the inclusion criteria in this study in order to proceed with the personalized invitation.\n\nIn the case that the participant meet the inclusion criteria and wishes to participate in the study, the professional evaluator is contacted to begin the process of submission in this study.\n\nThe professional evaluator has the responsibility to explain to the participant what the study consists of The professional evaluator is responsible for giving the participant the study information sheet (approved by the ethics committee and the management of the center where the study will be conducted).\n\nThe professional evaluator is responsible for collecting the signature of the informed consent to participate in this study (approved by the ethics committee and the management of the center where the study will be conducted).\n\nA numerical code (from 1 to 30) will be assigned to each patient according to the order of recruitment to keep their identity secret.\n\nThe code attributed to each participant will appear in the individual data collection notebook The association between the participant's identity and the attributed code will be known by the professional evaluator The code attributed to each participant will be entered in the spreadsheet where the collected data and results of the assessment tests will be uploaded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Telerehabilitation","Stroke Sequelae","Therapeutic Adherence and Compliance","Mobile Phone Use","Physical Disability","Neurologic Disorder"],"keywords":["Mobile Applications","Telerehabilitation","Stroke","Therapeutics","Functional recovery","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"In this simple blind randomized controlled pilot study, participants will be recruited from users of the rehabilitation center where the study will be carried out (Neurorehabilitation Clinic - Sant Cugat del Vallés). 30 participants will be recruited.
