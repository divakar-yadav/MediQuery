It is well known that it is causing death and disability .The incidence of stroke is increasing in low-income countries because of not using evidence-based practice in health-related conditions in these countries. Action observation training is one of the new developing rehabilitation technique that targets motor learning by the activation of mirror neurons and is the most important approach that targets the motor and functional recovery in stroke patients. A new treatment approach i .e action observation therapy, in which the movements are observed by the patient to provide visual stimulus, then patients are asked to perform those movements. A new approach acoustic stimulation is introduced for improving gait and balance in post stroke patients in which individual patient cadence is used to adjust the beats of sound so that auditory stimulation causes recovery.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a medical condition which causes the cessation of blood flow to the brain cells and results in cell death. It is a leading cause of death and disability. Geographical variations play a huge role in the burden for stroke. A stroke survivor experiences a range of symptoms that make it harder for them to carry out regular tasks and raise their risk of falling while walking .The effects of Action Observation Therapy with acoustic stimulation on balance in stroke patients have not been explicitly covered in recent studies. The study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments with evidence for post-stroke balance and gait."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Action Observation Therapy with Acoustic Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in the action observation therapy with acoustic stimulation group will be required to observe the lower limb movements or functional actions with sound of beats in video clips.
