It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment.","timeFrame":"20 minutes"},{"measure":"The Timed Up and Go test (TUG)","description":"The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.","timeFrame":"10 minutes"},{"measure":"10 meter walk test (10MWT)","description":"Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: \"Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.\"","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"Manual Muscle Test (MMT)","description":"Manual muscle testing (MMT) is a procedure for the evaluation of the function and strength of individual muscles and muscle groups based on the effective performance of a movement in relation to the forces of gravity and manual resistance.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Range of Motion (ROM)","description":"Range of Motion (ROM) testing is the measurement of movement around a specific joint or body part.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)","description":"The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability.
