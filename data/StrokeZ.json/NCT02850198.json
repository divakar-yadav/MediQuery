The clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT),consisting of two arms of scalp electroacupuncture group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group to value difference of upper limb function after 4 weeks. The result indicates that scalp electroacupuncture is more sufficient to alter function. The purpose is to value effectiveness of scalp electroacupuncture on motor function of the upper limb in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Upper limb(UL) impairment is common in patients of ischemic stroke and recovery of motor function is important for regaining independence in activities of daily living. Researches show that the death toll of people who suffering from stroke more than 200 millions,the annual growth rate of this data reached 8.7%, which ischemic stroke take percentage of 60-70, and who suffered from UL impairment reached about 70%. Nowadays, morbidity of ischemic stroke of China is the first of the world.\n\nAging is a risk for ischemic stroke，especially over the age of 50 years old, which will increase morbidity rate of UL motor function impairment.\n\nUL dysfunction make patients despaired and can not attend social activity normally, decreasing the quality of their lives. Attending social activity is very important for people's health, otherwise, people will get a series of diseases, like disability, depressive disorder,etc.\n\nThis subject is primary to compare effectiveness of scalp electroacupuncture and scalp acupuncture on motor function of the UL in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke. The clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT),consisting of two arms of scalp electroacupuncture group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group to value difference of upper limb function after 4 weeks. The result indicates that scalp electroacupuncture is more sufficient to alter function.\n\nAs a further study, this research contains two parallel arms of scalp electroacupuncture group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group. The purpose is to value effectiveness of scalp electroacupuncture on motor function of the UL in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke, comparing with sham scalp electroacupuncture."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":328,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Scalp electroacupuncture group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Select a 1.5 cun long disposable sterile filiform needle NO.30.Divide the Anterior oblique line of the vertex-temporal in ipsilesional into three equal parts to accept acupuncture.Insert the needle subcutaneously at a 30°angle to the scalp.The depth of insertion is 1 cun.The needle is twirled continuously at a frequency of about 170 times per minute.When the acupuncture sensation is obtained,connect the positive and negative outputs of the electroacupuncture to the handle of the needle in the Anterior oblique line of upper 1/3 and the middle 1/3.
