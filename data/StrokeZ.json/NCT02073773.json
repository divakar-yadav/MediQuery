It will be preceeded by a Phase 1 pilot trial of the VR physiotherapy and standard therapy only. Recruited in-patient rehabilitation ward patients who have recently suffered stroke will be randomized, through a computer-based random number generator, to either one of two treatment arms:\n\n1. Control occupational therapy + pharmacotherapy for 2 weeks\n2. Assisted Virtual-Reality physiotherapy + pharmacotherapy for 2 weeks","detailedDescription":"The study is designed as a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, preceeded by a Phase 1 pilot trial of the VR physiotherapy and standard therapy only.\n\nPhase 1 will comprise of recruitment of up to 5 patients who have recently suffered a stroke who will be informed that they will receive ten 15- 30 minutes of VR therapy in addition to their standard stroke therapy. They will not receive any pharmacotherapy during this period. At the start and end of the VR phase, clinical assessment (Fugl-Meyer scores, Action Research Arm Test) will be made of each patient by a blinded clinician investigator.\n\nFrom this data, calibration to the VR program will be made to ensure reproducibility of effectiveness of movements assessed.\n\nSubsequently, for the main phase of the trial, recruited in-patients who have recently suffered stroke will be randomized, through a computer-based random number generator, to either one of two treatment arms:\n\n1. Control occupational therapy + pharmacotherapy\n2. Assisted Virtual-Reality physiotherapy + pharmacotherapy\n\nEach patient will receive an initial functional Magnetic Resonace Imaging (fMRI) scan prior to the start of the study. The initial pilot single-centre study will be run in the Singapore General Hospital Rehabilitation Ward across a 2-week period, where participants will undergo daily 15-30 minute VR based therapy in addition to the physiotherapy/occupational therapy session they receive daily.\n\nThe VR therapy session consists of the subject interacting with a computer-based program in which they guide an avatar to gather items by using flexion and extension gestures of the affected upper limb. VR therapy sessions will last for 15-30 minutes depending on the subject's tolerance and participation. For patients who are unable to overcome gravity fully, they can still participate in this therapy by resting their arm on a table.\n\nPatients will receive a single dose of 100mg levodopa in combination with benserazide 2-3 hours before an additional half an hour of occupational therapy to the weaker arm or VR therapy session, depending on the assigned group.\n\nAt the start and end of the trial, clinical assessment (Fugl-Meyer scores, Action Research Arm Test and Functional Independence Measure) will be made of each patient by a blinded clinician investigator. At the final (10th) session, patients will undergo the final fMRI scan. MRI scans will be analysed by blinded assessors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischaemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, virtual reality based therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality based therapy, levodopa","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The VR therapy session consists of the subject interacting with a computer-based program in which they guide an avatar to gather items by using flexion and extension gestures of the affected upper limb.

The treatment proposed can be incorporated into their daily rehabilitation routine. Early intervention (within 7-21 days of the infarct) raises the chance for neuroplasticity and improved recovery of their motor function in the short and long run. Levodopa has been proven to be safe to be used in stroke patients (Lancet. 2001 Sep 8;358(9284):787-90., Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2008 Sep;89(9):1633-41.), however, the side effects of this medication may include nausea, unusual tiredness, dizziness, excessive watering of mouth.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual Reality based therapy, levodopa","occupational therapy, levodopa"],"otherNames":["Madopar"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual Reality based therapy","description":"The VR therapy session consists of the subject interacting with a computer-based program in which they guide an avatar to gather items by using flexion and extension gestures of the affected upper limb.
