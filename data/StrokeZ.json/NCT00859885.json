To date, there is no data from randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the risk of stroke recurrence after PDC with that under ATT only.

Even if RCTs are completed successfully, statistical differences may remain undetected with the planned sample sizes. Alternative data-gathering strategies such as multicenter registries are needed to overcome the low recruitment rates.\n\nObjective\n\n1) To compare the risk of recurrent stroke and TIA in patients aged ≤ 55 years with PFO and otherwise unexplained stroke who undergo PDC or receive ATT only; 2) To assess the etiological role of PFO for stroke/TIA in patients aged \\> 55 years; 3) To assess the risk of recurrent stroke/TIA in \"high-risk\" PFO patients (i.e. those with spontaneous (at rest) or large RLS, coinciding ASA, or multiple previous cerebrovascular events).\n\nMethods\n\nMulticenter prospective non-randomized study with scheduled 3-years follow-up of patients with PFO and ischemic stroke or TIA.
