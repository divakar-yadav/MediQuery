The advantages of using a treadmill are that a smaller space is needed compared to a 3D lab for motion analysis, more steps can be recorded in shorter time period and patients should not start, stop or rotate during the analyses. One of the systems which can be used to perform motion analysis on a treadmill is the GRAIL. This GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab) consists of an advanced treadmill with force sensors. Patients can walk on this treadmill with an imposed speed (fixed-speed) or at a speed determined by the patient itself (self-paced). Because not everyone is used to walk on a treadmill it is important to know if a person's walking pattern is different when he walks over ground compared to walking on the treadmill. Based on these insights, decisions can be made regarding interventions including treadmill training or this findings can be taking into account during further analysis of walking patterns on a treadmill. For this study stroke patients would be invited for an assessment on the treadmill (1 assessment moment). The movement pattern of these patients would be compared in different conditions:\n\n* (Forward and backward) Walking at comfortable walking speed on the GAITRite\n* Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode\n* Walking at comfortable walking speed +0.2 m/s (faster walking) on the treadmill in fixed speed mode\n* Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in self-paced mode\n* Backward walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode (only if patients are eligible to do so)\n\nHypotheses based on this study protocol:\n\n* Do stroke patients walk different over ground compared to treadmill walking\n* Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking self-paced compared to fixed speed\n* Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking fixed speed comfortable walking speed compared to fast walking\n* Is there a correlation between upper extremity impairment and arm swing"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait pattern","Treadmill walking","Arm swing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GaitRite","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will walk on the GaitRite.\n\n* forward walking at comfortable gait speed (6 x 10 meter)\n* backward walking at comfortable gait speed (4 x 10 meter)","interventionNames":["Other: Walking"]},{"label":"Treadmill walking self-paced","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will walk on the treadmill in self-paced mode.
