This study is designed as a 10-year, longitudinal follow-up investigating the residual disabilities, activity limitations, and quality of life issues arising in patients suffering from first-ever stroke. The main objectives of this study are to identify the factors that influence residual disability and long-term quality of life. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the risk of mortality and recurrent vascular events in patients with acute first-ever stroke. Investigators will investigate longitudinal health behaviors and patterns of healthcare utilization, including stroke rehabilitation care. Investigators will also investigate the long-term health status, mood, and quality of life in stroke patient caregivers. In addition, investigators will identify baseline and ongoing characteristics that are associated with secondary outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Disability","Function","Rehabilitation","Burden"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7858,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Korean modified Barthel Index","description":"measurement for activities of daily living","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Change in Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimensions","description":"measurement for quality of life","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Change in Functional Independence Measurement","description":"measurement for activities of daily living","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Change in Korean Mini-Mental State Examination","description":"measurement for cognitive function","timeFrame":"7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Change in Korean Version of Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test","description":"measurement for language function","timeFrame":"7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Change in modified Rankin Scale","description":"Measurement for disability.
