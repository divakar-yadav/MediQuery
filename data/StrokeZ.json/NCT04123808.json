The IpsiHand system involves using a hand robotic device that is controlled by brain waves, known as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). By using the device, participants will be harnessing brainwaves from the side of their brain not affected by stroke to control the robotic device on the hand that is weaker from the stroke.","detailedDescription":"This trial aims to assess the effectiveness of the NeuroLutions Upper Extremity Rehabilitation System, known as IpsiHand, on functional motor recovery and neuroplasticity for chronic stroke survivors with hemiparesis (N=27). The IpsiHand system involves a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) as a control for a robotic hand orthosis. Participants will complete 16-32 weeks of home therapy with the IpsiHand system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Rehabilitation","Upper Extremity","Neurological Rehabilitation","Neuronal Plasticity","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"An occupational therapist independent to the study will review and score 2 outcome measures (Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test).
