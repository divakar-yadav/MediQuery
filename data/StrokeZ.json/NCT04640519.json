It aims to evaluate the feasibility of a telehealth based model providing multidisciplinary access including nursing, pharmacy and physician care, and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of an integrated telehealth approach to blood pressure management after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Hypertension is the most modifiable risk factor for recurrent stroke. Blood pressure (BP) reduction is associated with decreased risk of stroke recurrence but remains poorly controlled in most survivors. Minority groups have a higher prevalence of uncontrolled BP and higher rates of stroke. Limited access contributes to challenges in post-stroke care. Telehealth After Stroke Care (TASC) will be a telehealth intervention that integrates remote BP monitoring and telehealth visits to enhance BP control and promote self-efficacy, with a multidisciplinary approach to improve clinical processes and health outcomes. The investigators will assess for feasibility and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy. Fifty (50) eligible patients will be screened for inclusion prior to hospital discharge and randomized to TASC or usual care. TASC patients will receive a BP monitoring kit and electronic tablet. They will be scheduled with 5 telehealth visits over 3 months, including primary care nurse practitioner, pharmacy at 4 and 8 weeks and stroke neurologist. Usual care patients will be seen by a primary care nurse practitioner at 1-2 weeks and a stroke neurologist at 1 and 3 months. Data will be collected at 0 and 3 months. The primary outcome will be BP control (BP \\<140/90 mmHg) at 3 months. The secondary outcome will be self-efficacy in medication adherence and treatment. Interdisciplinary team competency, fidelity, and telehealth satisfaction surveys will be administered. Patient reported outcomes including depression, cognitive function, and socioeconomic determinants will also be collected. Integrated team-based interventions are needed to improve BP control and reduce racial disparities in post-stroke care. It may be feasible and effective in enhancing post-stroke BP control and promoting self-efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Health Care Acceptability","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Telehealth","Blood Pressure (BP)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Multidisciplinary Team Nursing: transitions of care, motivational interview w/ tailored infographics\n\nPharmacy: medication education, adherence and titration\n\nPhysician: patient tailored risk factor control, post stroke complications\n\nIntegrated Approach: Home BP monitoring with remote support, Telehealth visits by each discipline, Tailored BP infographics, Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TASC Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TASC patients will receive a BP monitoring kit and electronic tablet and tailored infographics, and attend 5 telehealth visits over 3 months, including primary care nurse practitioner, pharmacy and stroke neurologist.","interventionNames":["Other: TASC intervention"]},{"label":"TASC Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual care patients will be seen by a primary care nurse practitioner and a stroke neurologist.","interventionNames":["Other: Usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual care","description":"Usual care patients will be seen by a primary care nurse practitioner and a stroke neurologist.","armGroupLabels":["TASC Control"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"TASC intervention","description":"TASC patients will receive a BP monitoring kit and electronic tablet with patient tailored BP infographics.
