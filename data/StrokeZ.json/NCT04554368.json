Patients were classified as having one of three grades according to the presence of contrast filling within the occluded vascular territory. Grade 0 was normal or less contrast filling in affected hemisphere, grade 1 and 2 were small and medium-large area without contrast filling, respectively. The Youden index was used to determine the optimum no contrast filling area cutoff for defining grade 1 and 2. The score was subsequently validated in a different population of 208 patients and compared with three established scores."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Thrombectomy","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IA-CEFDCT group","description":"95 patients who underwent IA-CEFDCT and MT for acute anterior stroke.","interventionNames":["Procedure: intra-arterial contrast enhanced Flat Detector CT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"intra-arterial contrast enhanced Flat Detector CT","description":"After femoral artery puncture, FDCT scan (if necessary) and IA-CEFDCT scan were performed on a single flat-detector angiography system (Allura Xper FD20, Philips Medical systems, Best, the Netherlands), respectively.
