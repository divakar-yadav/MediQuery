The Track group will show greater improvement in ankle range of motion compared to the Move group.\n2. The Track group will show greater improvement in ankle tracking accuracy and greater changes in fMRI (increase in relative volume of activation for ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex, increase in laterality index, and decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity index) compared to Move group.\n3. The Track group will show greater improvement in tracking accuracy at an untrained joint (knee) compared to the Move group.\n4. The Track group will show greater improvement in standing balance.\n5. The Track group will show greater improvement in walking speed and ankle dorsiflexion during gait compared to the Move group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ankle tracking","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"subjects track a target with ankle movement","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ankle tracking training"]},{"label":"ankle movement","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"ankle tracking training","description":"one group will use the ankle for tracking, the other group will use the ankle for simple movement","armGroupLabels":["ankle tracking"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ankle range of motion","timeFrame":"Measurement at pretest, posttest and followup"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
