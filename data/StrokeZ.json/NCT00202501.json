If RPSG shows an AHI \\> 20, with predominant obstructive events, patients will be randomized in a CONTROL GROUP (conventional treatment) and a TREATMENT GROUP (with Nasal CPAP). Follow up for both groups at 1, 3, 12 and 24 months will include: early neurological outcome, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), functional recovery (Barthel Index/Canadian Scale), quality of life (SF36), recurrences, vital status. Nasal CPAP titration will be performed by means of an automatic system (Autoset Portable ST). Compliance will be recorded. If a negative RPSG is obtained (AHI \\< 10) (NO SAS GROUP) or with AHI \\< 20 (mild SAS) the usual treatment and the same follow up protocol will be established.\n\nSTATISTICS: the sample size is initially calculated in 10 patients for each group, considering this is part of a multicenter study including 8 centers. If no differences are found, depending on the statistical power the investigators will consider including more patients. The different groups will be compared for the analyzed variables with the corresponding tests."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Apnea","Stroke","Cardiovascular Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Nasal CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurologic recovering"},{"measure":"Quality of life"},{"measure":"Recurrences"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To assess feasibility of Nasal CPAP treatment in patients with stroke."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* First ever stroke\n* Any Sleep Apnea symptom\n* Hypertension\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aphasia\n* Cognitive impairment\n* Hypersomnolence","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Olga Parra, MD","affiliation":"Hospital Universitari Sagrat Cor","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital Universitari Sagrat Cor","city":"Barcelona","zip":"08329","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34739082","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Reynor A, McArdle N, Shenoy B, Dhaliwal SS, Rea SC, Walsh J, Eastwood PR, Maddison K, Hillman DR, Ling I, Keenan BT, Maislin G, Magalang U, Pack AI, Mazzotti DR, Lee CH, Singh B.
