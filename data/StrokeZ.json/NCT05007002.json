Current evidence on treatment of upper limb sensory impairments is scarce and shows unclear results. Robot-based therapy has been increasingly used to treat upper limb motor impairments, with similar positive results as compared to conventional therapy. This study aims to investigate a novel robot-based therapy program for treatment of upper limb sensory impairments. The therapy program consists of 10 one-hour session spread over 4 weeks and will be evaluated for its effect in 20 chronic stroke patients. The investigators hypothesize that a 4-week robot-based therapy program can improve upper limb sensation and movement.","detailedDescription":"Up to 70% of stroke survivors show upper limb impairments consisting of motor and/or somatosensory impairments. These impairments often persist well into the chronic stage, and may lead to significant limitations in activities of daily living and may negatively affect quality of life. Different interventions have been investigated to treat upper limb motor impairments, including robot-based therapy, which shows similar positive results as compared to conventional therapy. Evidence on interventions for somatosensory impairments is scarce and often of low quality. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effect of a robot-based therapy program on sensorimotor function of the upper limb in a group of 20 chronic stroke patients.\n\nThe robot-based therapy will be provided using the Kinarm End-Point Lab (BKIN Technologies Ltd., Canada) and consists of passive and active therapy tasks for proprioception and sensory processing. The therapy consists of 10 one-hour sessions spread over 4 weeks. Clinical and robot-based motor and somatosensory assessments will be performed at 4 time points: twice at baseline, once at mid intervention, and once after 10 hours of therapy. The investigators hypothesize to find improvement in both upper limb motor and somatosensory function after the therapy program. The results from this pilot study will provide a basis for further research."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Upper limb","Somatosensation","Sensory
