The aim of virtual reality is to investigate motor interactions in a fictitious, configurable environment, in order to train specific functions and transpose improvements into everyday life.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of different moving virtual scenes on the general spatiotemporal parameters of pressure centers, in a sub-acute stroke rehabilitation context.\n\nThis would help health professionals to assess the most suitable VR exercise in function of patient's difficulties.\n\nDuring this study, patient movements while viewing 8 different virtual reality scenes will be recorded using a motion platform during a single session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation","Postural Equilibrium"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Recruitment of twenty patients.
