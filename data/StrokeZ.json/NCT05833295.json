The seat belt will only serve as a safety mechanism in case of a fall and will not support any body weight while walking. Each participant will walk for 20 minutes under one of 3 slope conditions; treadmill walking on 0° flat ground, , downhill walking with treadmill on -7.5° slope and downhill walking with treadmill on -15° slope.\n\nFirst, by asking the participants to walk at their comfortable speed for straight walking on the treadmill with tools, the walking speed will be determined and carried out at the specified speeds. All self-selected walking speeds will be determined in two 30-second trials. During the 20-minute walk for each condition, if the participant needs to slow down, the speed of the treadmill will be reduced to adapt to this, and the average walking speed during the 20-minute walking session will be reported. Pulse and blood pressure will be monitored before, during and after the walk.\n\nAll participants will be evaluated with modified asworth scale, modified tardeu scale, 2 minute walking test, modified rankin scale, timed get up and walk test, fatigue impact scale, stroke impact scale, berg balance scale, fugl meyer assessment scale before treatment.\n\nPatients will be randomized into 3 groups. Then, the H / M ratio will be looked at in all 3 groups. After the first walking session, the H / M ratio will be repeated. after completing the 5-session walking program, clinical and electrophysiological tests will be repeated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Patients will be randomized into 3 groups.
