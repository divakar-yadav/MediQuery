This study is to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of GNR-060 vs Metalyse as a thrombolitic agent in patients with with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).","detailedDescription":"The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized single blinded study with the centralized blinded outcome assessment. The patients with diagnosed STEMI will be randomly assigned with one of the treatment options within 4 hours after the symptoms onset. The effectiveness of the tested product GNR-060 or reference product Metalyze will be assessed by the coronarography within 24 hours after the thrombolysis with the following PCI in case of ineffectiveness. The patients will then be followed up for survival and cardiac events for 90 days. The safety assessment will also include any related hemorrhagic complication. The pharmacokinetic parameters and immunogenicity will be also assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction"],"keywords":["Myocardial Infarction","ST
