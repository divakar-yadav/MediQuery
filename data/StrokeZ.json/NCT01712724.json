Research conducted in chronic disease and healthy populations suggest that AT and RT \"combination therapy\" may produce synergistic and superior effects along cognition and mobility domains, when compared to AT alone. However, the effects of a combined training approach (AT+RT) compared to AT alone has not been investigated in people post-stroke.","detailedDescription":"Patients referred to Toronto Rehabilitation Institute's Risk Factor Modification and Exercise Program following Stroke (TRI-REPS) will be randomized to either AT+RT or AT alone. Mobility (6 minute walk test), and cognition (Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards) will be measured pre- post 6 months of exercise. Secondary measures will include body composition, and biochemical changes. This project will help to determine an exercise treatment strategy that will guide best practice guidelines aimed at promoting mobility and brain health in people post-stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["exercise therapy","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aerobic Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Walking, elliptical, stationary recumbent or upright cycling will be the modes of AT prescribed depending on individual ability and access to equipment when away from the Centre.
