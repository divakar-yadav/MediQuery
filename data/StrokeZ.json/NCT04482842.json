It will illustrate the significance of gene-guided warfarin for administered dose to anticoagulation therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Then it will establish and verify a warfarin stable dose prediction model suitable for such patients, and provide basis for the personalized medication regimen of warfarin in patients with acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gene-guided Warfarin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Gene detection (CYP2C9*3, VKORC1)","Drug: Warfarin Sodium"]},{"label":"Routine use","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin Sodium"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Gene detection (CYP2C9*3, VKORC1)","description":"Warfarin is administered at the recommended dose by detecting CYP2C9\\*3 and VKORC1 gene polymorphismsand.
