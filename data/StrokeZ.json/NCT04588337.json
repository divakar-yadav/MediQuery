At present, only ultra-early thrombolytic therapy, endovascular therapy and antiplatelet therapy have obtained evidence-based medical evidence in ischemic stroke treatment, but only thrombolytic therapy and endovascular therapy can improve the good prognosis of patients. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy within 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms has been shown to be effective, which is recommended in the guidelines.\n\nIn most countries, alteplase (R-tPA) is the only drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Recombinant human TNK tissue-type plasminogen activator (rhTNK-tPA) is a modified recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, with no procoagulant effect and a longer half life. In recent years, there are some studies on the comparison of therapeutic effects of TNK-tPA and RT-PA in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and TNK shows promising especially for large artery occlussion. At present, there are few reports on the application of rhTNK-tPA in Chinese stroke patients.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhTNK-tPA in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke in a prospective, multicenter registration study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"rhTNK-tPA","description":"Thrombolysis"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of excellent prognosis (mRS 0-1)","description":"The proportion of excellent prognosis (mRS 0-1) after thrombolysis","timeFrame":"90 ± 7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the proportion of good prognosis (mRS 0-2)","description":"The proportion of good prognosis (mRS 0-2) after thrombolysis","timeFrame":"90 ± 7 days"},{"measure":"The incidence of stroke deterioration after thrombolysis","description":"NIHSS score increased by more than 2, excluding cerebral hemorrhage","timeFrame":"within 1 week"},{"measure":"the incidence of stroke recurrence and other vascular events","description":"the incidence of stroke recurrence and other vascular events within 90 ± 7 days after thrombolysis","timeFrame":"within 90 ± 7 days"},{"measure":"symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","description":"any evidence of bleeding on the head CT scan associated with clinically significant neurological deterioration (NIHSS score ≥4 points increase)","timeFrame":"within 36 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
