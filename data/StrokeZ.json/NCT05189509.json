Although EXTEND study has proved that intravenous thrombolysis can be extended from 4.5 to 9 hours, but the eligible patients must be selected by CTP. Thus, it is of clinical importance how to extend the time window of intravenous thrombolysis, which can benifit more patients. The current trial aims to investigate the effect of intravenous thrombolysis with TNK from 4.5 to 6 hours in ischemic stroke with help of Butyphthalide, which was found to be neuroprotective."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TNK group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"intravenous thrombolysis with 0.25 mg/kg TNK, with the biggest dose of 25 mg","interventionNames":["Drug: TNK-Tissue Plasminogen Activator"]},{"label":"control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: TNK-Tissue Plasminogen Activator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"TNK-Tissue Plasminogen Activator","description":"0.25 mg TNK thrombolysis","armGroupLabels":["TNK group","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","description":"any evidence of bleeding on the head CT scan associated with clinically significant neurological deterioration (NIHSS score ≥4 points increase)","timeFrame":"36 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of excellent prognosis (mRS 0-1)","description":"the minimum and maximum values of modified Rankin Score are 0 and 6, respectively;
