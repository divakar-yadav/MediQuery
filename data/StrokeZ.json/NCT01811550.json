The SHINE trial will recruit 1,400 AIS patients with Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperglycemia, each receiving 3 days of hyperglycemia control with intravenous (IV) insulin therapy or control therapy with subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. The I-SPOT trial will recruit 315 SHINE patients. Blood coagulation marker levels will be measured before and at 48 hours after the start of treatment. Baseline and temporal changes in biomarkers levels will be compared between treatment groups.\n\nHypothesis: The decrease in levels of markers of blood coagulation will be greater in patients treated with IV insulin to reduce BG than in patients treated with SQ Insulin as the standard fashion.\n\nHypothesis: The decrease in levels of markers of blood coagulation will be greater in patients with than without favorable (SHINE) outcome (defined as the baseline stroke severity adjusted measure of functional ability at 90 days after AIS).\n\nHypothesis: Hyperglycemia control modulates the relationship between blood coagulation levels and functional outcome in T2DM patients after stroke. Patients treated with IV Insulin for hyperglycemia control with favorable (SHINE) outcome will have greater decreases in blood coagulation levels than either IV Insulin-treated patients without favorable outcome or SQ Insulin-treated with or without favorable outcomes at 90 days after AIS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hyperglycemia","Procoagulation
