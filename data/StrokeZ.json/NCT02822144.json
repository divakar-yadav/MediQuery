Several multicentric randomized controlled trials have shown the benefit of a mechanical thrombectomy in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke on functional disability, compared to a medical treatment alone (thrombolysis).\n\nThe timeliness of revascularisation is an essential factor of good prognosis. This intra-arterial treatment, associated with thrombolysis if applicable, is the reference treatment of large-vessel occlusion. The stillness of the patient is required to control the safety of the recanalization. Currently, either a general anesthesia or a sedation can be performed.\n\nSeveral studies have shown a trend to superiority of the sedation but none was conducted with a high level of proof methodology.\n\nThe aim of our multicentric randomized controlled trial is to compare sedation and general anesthesia during intra-arterial thrombectomy for an acute ischaemic stroke in the anterior cerebral circulation. The main outcome will be the efficacy on the functional neurological prognosis at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","thrombectomy","anesthesia","sedation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":351,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"general anesthesia","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"General anesthesia with etomidate, succinylcholine, propofol and remifentanil","interventionNames":["Drug: Etomidate","Drug: Succinylcholine","Drug: Propofol","Drug: Remifentanil"]},{"label":"sedation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sedation with remifentanil and local anesthesia with lidocaine","interventionNames":["Drug: Remifentanil","Drug: Lidocaine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Etomidate","armGroupLabels":["general anesthesia"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Succinylcholine","armGroupLabels":["general anesthesia"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Propofol","armGroupLabels":["general anesthesia"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Remifentanil","armGroupLabels":["general anesthesia","sedation"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Lidocaine","armGroupLabels":["sedation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Score on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recanalization delay","description":"Delay between first symptoms and last angiography","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Delay between patient's hospitalization and start of procedure","description":"At the time of puncture","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Quality of recanalization assessed with TICI (Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction) score","description":"At the last angiography","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"NIHSS score","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"NIHSS score","timeFrame":"Day 7"},{"measure":"Angiographic complications: number of patients wtih dissection, arterial rupture, thrombus in another territory","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Number of episodes of hypo- / hypertension","timeFrame":"24 hours after thrombectomy"},{"measure":"Number of patients with noradrenaline administration during anesthesia","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Number of sedations converted to general anesthesia and reason","timeFrame":"Day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Body mass index \\< or equal to 35 kg/m² ,\n* Indication for thrombectomy, after multidisciplinary consultation,\n* Proximal artery occlusion in the anterior circulation (internal carotid artery, M1, M2,...), confirmed on imaging (angioscan or angio-MRI),\n* Written informed consent of the patient or a close / trusted person when possible, or emergency procedure,\n* Patient affiliated to or beneficiary of an health insurance\n\nNon-inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Comorbidity committing short-term prognosis,\n* Hemodynamic instability,\n* Pregnant woman,\n* Contra-indication to sedation: pre-existing swallowing impairment;
