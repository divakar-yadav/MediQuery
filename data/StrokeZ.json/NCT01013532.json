Usually 40 to 60 percent of recurrent strokes after cerebral hemorrhage cases are cerebral infarction; and 5 to 10 percent of recurrent stroke after cerebral infarction cases are cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nConsequently, for the reasons described above, hemorrhagic side effects including cerebral hemorrhage have been a great concern, in the usage of antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant for the secondary prevention in the patients with cerebral infarction.\n\nIt is reported that the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage tends to increase in cases of accompanying lacunar infarction which occurs more frequently in Asians than in Westerners, or periventricular ischemic change which increasingly occurs with ageing. Accordingly, the point is that the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage should be primarily considered in the treatment of cerebral infarction, along with the phenomenon of an ageing population both in Asian countries including Korea.\n\nNevertheless, so far there has been no clinical research regarding secondary prevention of stroke, particularly considering the risk of occurrence of hemorrhage in cerebral infarction cases. However, according to a recent study, when phosphodiesterase inhibitors including Cilostazol are used independently, or in combination with aspirin, secondary prevention can be improved without increasing the occurrence of hemorrhagic side effects.\n\nConsidering this, if it is proved that the agent, Cilostazol, could decrease the risk of occurrence of stoke, along with no significant increase in the risk of occurrence of hemorrhagic side effects, by selecting a patent group with a high risk of cerebral hemorrhage, the agent (Cilostazol) may be recognized as an unique antiplatelet agent applicable to old-aged patient with cerebral infarction who have a certain risk of cerebral hemorrhage.\n\n* High risk of cerebral hemorrhage is defined as presence of history of cerebral hemorrhage with appropriate neuroimage findings or presence of asymptomatic old cerebral hemorrhage findings(equal or more than 8mm) or multiple microbleeds on the GRE images.\n* 1600 ischemic stroke patients with high risk of cerebral hemorrhage will be recruited and they are randomized into four groups (cilostazol plus probucol, aspirin plus probucol, cilostazol and aspirin) by 2X2 factorial design.\n* IMT and ABI will be measured every year during follow-up period and the results will be compared with the baseline data. The change of IMT and ABI will be analyzed with the occurrence of cardiovascular events.\n* The study will finish at least 1 year after the recruit of 1600th patients. Until the finish, all patients will continuously take study medications and visit every 3months at the study site.\n* Brain MRI including FLAIR and GRE will be done at the final visits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia","Intracranial Hemorrhages"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Intracranial Hemorrhage","Cilostazol","Probucol"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cilostazol+ Probucol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"100mg cilostazol bid plus probucol plus placebo of aspirin","interventionNames":["Drug: Cilostazol","Drug: Probucol","Drug: placebo of aspirin","Device: ankle-brachial index (ABI)","Device: intima-medial thickness (IMT)","Device: new asymptomatic brain hemorrhage","Device: new ischemic lesions on follow-up FLAIR images"]},{"label":"Aspirin + Probucol","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"aspirin plus placebo cilostazol plus probucol","interventionNames":["Drug: Probucol","Drug: Aspirin","Drug: placebo of cilostazol","Device: ankle-brachial index (ABI)","Device: intima-medial thickness (IMT)","Device: new asymptomatic brain hemorrhage","Device: new ischemic lesions on follow-up FLAIR images"]},{"label":"Cilostazol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cilostazol plus placebo of aspirin","interventionNames":["Drug: Cilostazol","Drug: placebo of aspirin","Device: ankle-brachial index (ABI)","Device: intima-medial thickness (IMT)","Device: new asymptomatic brain hemorrhage","Device: new ischemic lesions on follow-up FLAIR images"]},{"label":"Aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"aspirin plus placebo of cilostazol","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin","Drug: placebo of cilostazol","Device: ankle-brachial index (ABI)","Device: intima-medial thickness (IMT)","Device: new asymptomatic brain hemorrhage","Device: new ischemic lesions on follow-up FLAIR images"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cilostazol","description":"Cilostazol 100mg bid","armGroupLabels":["Cilostazol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"],"otherNames":["Pletaal produced by Korea Otsuka Pharmaceutical company"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Probucol","description":"Probucol 250mg bid","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin + Probucol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"],"otherNames":["Probucol is produced by Otsuka Pharmaceutical"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"Aspirin 100mg qd","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin","Aspirin + Probucol"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo of cilostazol","description":"same shape and size of active cilostazol","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin","Aspirin + Probucol"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo of aspirin","description":"same size and shape of active aspirin 100mg","armGroupLabels":["Cilostazol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ankle-brachial index (ABI)","description":"measurement of ABI every years during follow up","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin","Aspirin + Probucol","Cilostazol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"intima-medial thickness (IMT)","description":"ultrasound measured IMT of both common carotid arteries","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin","Aspirin + Probucol","Cilostazol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"],"otherNames":["change of maximal IMT and mean IMT"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"new asymptomatic brain hemorrhage","description":"asymptomatic macrobleedings or microbleedings on GRE images","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin","Aspirin + Probucol","Cilostazol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"new ischemic lesions on follow-up FLAIR images","description":"any new ischemic lesions","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin","Aspirin + Probucol","Cilostazol","Cilostazol+ Probucol"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to the first occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage","timeFrame":"time since randomization;
