Different studies has been done to find out the best therapy for stroke patients. Use of virtual reality in medical field is becoming more popular now-a-days. Different devices and applications are available to treat various conditions. Research has been done to find the clinical applications of virtual reality for upper limb motor rehabilitation in stroke. in another study, mirror therapy with bilateral arm training was used for hemiplegic upper extremity motor functions in patients with chronic stroke. After doing literature review, it was found that no research has been done to compare the effectiveness of mirror therapy with virtual reality in improving motor function of upper limb of stroke patients. So, In this study these two therapies are compared. For virtual reality Oculus Quest 2 has been used. Patients were allowed to use beat saber game on Oculus."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["virtual reallity","Mirror therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The participant are divided into two groups.
