The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the mean blood flow velocity (MFV) and Gosling pulsatility index (PI) captured for the middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral artery were the outcome measures.\n\nFifteen 30-minute sessions of tACS appear to be effective for enhancing post-stroke patients' neurological function. The haemodynamic measures taken indicated that the regaining of function among the patients was largely attributed to a lowering of the vascular autoregulatory activity together with an increase in blood flow velocity at the middle cerebral artery. Future studies should explore the underlying mechanisms mediating the positive effects brought about by tACS in post-stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["brain electrical stimulation","sub-acute post-stroke","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":312,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tACS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients in the control group followed exactly the same protocol but without receiving the transcranial alternating current stimulation ."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)","description":"Patients in the tACS group received a total of 15 sessions of brain stimulation.
