However, some patients still experience poor prognosis, with ineffective recanalization and reperfusion brain injury being the major contributors to unfavorable outcomes. Studies have indicated that tocilizumab, used in ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, exhibits anti-inflammatory and myocardial protective effects. Nevertheless, whether tocilizumab can provide neuroprotection in the early stages of acute large vessel recanalization remains uncertain. Given the above evidence, the aim of this study was to investigate whether combination therapy with tocilizumab in the early phase of recanalization of acute large vessel occlusion could further exert a beneficial effect and thus improve the poor prognosis of patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Interleukin-6","Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Treatment"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Tocilizumab","Neuroprotection","Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":108,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tocilizumab group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenously for more than 1 hour.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tocilizumab"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenously for more than 1 hour.","interventionNames":["Drug: NaCl 0.9% 100ml"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tocilizumab","description":"Single dose intravenous application","armGroupLabels":["Tocilizumab group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"NaCl 0.9% 100ml","description":"Single dose intravenous application","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in infarct-core volume","description":"The infarct-core volume is determined by diffusion-weighted MRI, CT, or CTP images.","timeFrame":"72 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early neurological improvement","description":"Decrease in National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score of ≥8 or NIHSS score of 0-2 within 24 hours.
