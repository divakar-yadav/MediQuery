The secondary aims include comparing with standard medical care without MT, to determine whether performing MT exceeding 24 hours of last known well is safe on the risks of any ICH, sICH, and any SAE. Other secondary aims include early improvement in neurological recovery as measured by NIHSS scores at 7 days; successful recanalization rate; imaging measurements of infarct size at 24-48 hours; death or major disability (mRS 3-6); separately on death and disability (mRS 3-5); HRQoL using Euro-QoL EQ-5D questionnaire; utility-weighted modified Rankin scale scores; duration of hospitalization; residence; and hospital service costs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Large vessel occlusion","Mechanical thrombectomy","Extended time","Randomised clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":382,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy to be initiated as soon as possible after randomisation.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients assigned to the control group will avoid treating MT and only receive the standard medical treatment according to local guidelines."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mechanical thrombectomy","description":"Subjects in intervention group will receive MT as soon as possible.
