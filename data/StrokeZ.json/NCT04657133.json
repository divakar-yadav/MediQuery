Currently, ICH has been a devastating type of stroke that lacking effective therapy. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), a systematically protective strategy, has been found to have neuroprotective effects by in patients with ischemic stroke. In addition, animal studies show that RIC is safe in ICH model and it could accelerate the absorption of hematoma. In a previous clinical study (RICH-1), RIC have been found to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with ICH. Therefore, the investigators plan to undertake this study to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of RIC in patients with ICH.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that treatment with RIC will accelerate the absorption of hematoma and improve patients' functional outcomes. Results of this study can potentially bring into account new means to improve the outcomes of ICH patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Therapy","Neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":452,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects in the intervention group will receive remote ischemic conditioning and standard background medical treatment.","interventionNames":["Device: Remote ischemic conditioning","Drug: Standard medication therapy"]},{"label":"Sham group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects in the placebo group will receive sham remote ischemic conditioning and standard background medical treatment alone.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham remote ischemic conditioning","Drug: Standard medication therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Remote ischemic conditioning","description":"RIC is a non-invasive therapy that performed by an electric autocontrol device with cuff placed on arm.
