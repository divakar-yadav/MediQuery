Barriers to implementation include time and resource. The feasibility of using the Bridges Stroke Self-Management Programme within an Early Supported Discharge Service and delivery by Rehabilitation Assistants is unknown.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate key trial parameters to inform the protocol of a future definitive trial into the effectiveness of Bridges delivered by rehabilitation assistants within an Early Supported Discharge Service."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["self-management","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rehabilitation Assistant","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Bridges stroke self-management programme.
