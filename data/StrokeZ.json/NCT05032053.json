And further combined with proteomic methods to explore serological markers that can be used to accurately predict the prognosis of such patients.","detailedDescription":"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are caused by microvascular lesions in the brain, which is a subclinical deposition of hemosiderin after the damage of microvascular. Antithrombotic drug are widely used in the secondary prevention of patients with ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that antithrombotic drug can increase the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients with cerebral microbleeds. For such patients, how to carry out effective and safe antithrombotic therapy is still unclear.\n\nWe will study from two aspects: 1) We designed a cohort registration study to observe the prognosis and progress of CMBs in ischemic stroke patients one year after using various antithrombotic drugs. 2) Data independent acquisition quantitative proteomics (DIA quantitative proteomics) will be used to screen serum protein markers that may affect the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients with CMBs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","microbleeds","Proteomics","antithrombotic drug"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Antithrombotic drugs","description":"The purpose of our study is to observe the effect of various antithrombotic drugs on the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients with cerebral microbleeds."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Increase of cerebral microbleeds","description":"How many cerebral microbleeds increased after 1 year of antithrombotic drugs treatment.
