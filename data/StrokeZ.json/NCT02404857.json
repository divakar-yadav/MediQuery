The current protocol evaluates the therapeutic potential of a EEG based driven BCI that is connected to a non-invasive pneumatic glove for rehabilitation of hand flexion/extension post-stroke. The system non-invasive, portable and low-cost. The utility and usability of the system will be investigated at two levels. First by means of questionnaires for patients and therapist and second by means of in depth analysis of the EEG signals during intended, imagined and passive driven hand movements in relation to no movement at all and the capacity of the BCI to distinguish between these conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Poststroke/CVA Hemiparesis","Paralytic Stroke","Hand Flaccid Paralysis"],"keywords":["Post stroke","BCI","Reeducation","Hand movement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chronic post-stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients \\>6 months post-stroke with little to no hand movement. use of EEG based BCI in the neurorehabilitation process","interventionNames":["Device: EEG based Brain Computer Interface"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"EEG based Brain Computer Interface","description":"Using EEG signals to classify brain activity being 'rest' or 'active' to control the attached pneumatic glove and close the sensory-motor loop between intentional/mental movement and physical (though passive) movement.","armGroupLabels":["Chronic post-stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Performance of the BCI-system (evaluation of performance through patient questionaires & the performance of the BCI classifier during intended and imagined hand movements)","description":"Evaluation of the BCI-platform performance through patient questionnaires \\& the performance of the BCI classifier during intended and imagined hand movements.","timeFrame":"During the whole study.
