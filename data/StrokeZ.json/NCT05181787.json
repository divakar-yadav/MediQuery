Stroke caused by AF is very dangerous, which not only threatens the life of patients, but also seriously affects the quality of life. This study aims to explore the biomarkers of stroke in patients with AF by integrating proteomics and metabolomics data, and establish the network relationship of stroke in patients with AF, so as to reveal the molecular mechanism of stroke in patients with AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","metabolomics","proteomics","Biomarkers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AF","description":"Patients with AF","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Proteomics","Diagnostic Test: Metabolomics"]},{"label":"AF and stroke","description":"Patients with AF complicated with stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Proteomics","Diagnostic Test: Metabolomics"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Proteomics","description":"Proteomic data were obtained by LC-MS/MS Analysis-DIA platform.","armGroupLabels":["AF","AF and stroke"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Metabolomics","description":"Metabolomic data were obtained by UPLC-QTOF/MS platform.","armGroupLabels":["AF","AF and stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Biomarkers of atrial fibrillation complicated with stroke based on proteomics and metabolomics","description":"By combining proteomics and metabolomics data, the investigators were able to identify the common pathways involved in AF with stroke.","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quantitative changes of individual metabolites and proteins were calculated and graphed using the KEGG mapping tools.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"By combining proteomics and metabolomics data, the investigators were able to identify the common pathways involved in AF with stroke.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"All of the omics data were used to compare proteins/enzymes with metabolic pathways.","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
