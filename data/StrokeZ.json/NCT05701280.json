The first phase has a sample size of 40 subjects. The second phase has an estimated sample size of 162 subjects which may be adjusted based on analysis of the first phase.\n\nEach subject will be implanted with the DBS system, undergo DBS program optimization, and be randomized to test treatment (Tt) or active-control treatment (Ct). After randomization, all subjects will participate in a five-month outpatient rehabilitation therapy program. After five months of blinded randomized testing, subjects assigned to active-control treatment (Ct) will cross over to receive test treatment (Tt) and participate in a second five-month therapy program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Deep Brain Stimulation","DBS","Physical Therapy","Rehabilitation","Brain Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Double-blinded, randomized, parallel study with partial crossover.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Participants, Care Providers (Therapists), Investigators, and Outcome Assessors do not know to which group the participants are randomized.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":202,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DBS+Rehab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Active-DBS combined with motor rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Device: Deep Brain Stimulation"]},{"label":"Rehab","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control-DBS combined with motor rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Deep Brain Stimulation","description":"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the dentate nucleus area of the cerebellum plus motor rehabilitation to improve upper-extremity function.","armGroupLabels":["DBS+Rehab"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation","description":"Motor rehabilitation to improve upper-extremity function.","armGroupLabels":["Rehab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity sub-scale (FMA-UE)","description":"The change in FMA-UE is significantly greater for subjects who receive Test treatment (Tt) than Control treatment (Ct).","timeFrame":"Week-12 to Week-32"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity sub-scale (FMA-UE)","description":"The change in FMA-UE for subjects who receive Test treatment (Tt) is significantly above a clinically important difference (CID)","timeFrame":"Week-12 to Week-32"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity sub-scale (FMA-UE)","description":"Exploratory endpoints will be examined for the group originally assigned to Control treatment after crossover.","timeFrame":"Week-32, Week-40 and Week 52"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke, with an initial incident occurring between 12 months to 6 years before implant, resulting in residual upper extremity hemiparesis.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous or subsequent cerebrovascular events resulting in residual upper extremity impairment\n* Brain lesions with significant involvement of the brainstem, cerebellum, or thalamus","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Cleveland Clinic","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Cleveland","state":"Ohio","zip":"44195","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Stevenson","role":"CONTACT","phone":"216-445-0926","email":"STEVENK12@ccf.org"},{"name":"Andre Machado, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.4995,"lon":-81.69541}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Upper Extremity Paresis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
