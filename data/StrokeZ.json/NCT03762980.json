A Quasi Experimental Study conducted on community stroke survivors. A total of 24 stroke patients were included and divided into Group A (Right hemiplegia) (n=12) and Group B (Left hemiplegia) (n=12). Chronic stroke patients (\\>3 months), aged 30-70 years with left or right sided diagnosed stroke patients were included while patients on medication that could affect the cognitive functions or with any other cognitive impairments who are not able to follow commands were excluded. Both groups received the same intervention of with bilateral arm training involving 5 functional tasks to improve the functional activities of daily living in upper extremities. Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity Tool (FMA-UE) and Wolf-Motor Function Test (WMFT) were used to assess as outcome measures.The measurements were obtained at baseline and after 6th week of training. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 21."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Right hemiplegic patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Bilateral training (BAT)"]},{"label":"Left hemiplegic patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Bilateral training (BAT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bilateral training (BAT)","description":"Each group received bilateral training) for upper extremities for 3 days per week for 01 hour/day for up to 6 weeks.
