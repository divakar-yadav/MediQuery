Hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, will be randomised into two arms (1:1): an intervention arm and a control arm. Hospitals in the intervention arm will receive a multilevel system intervention based on information platform, whereas hospitals in the control arm will receive no intervention. The randomisation will be conducted after baseline data collection. The following baseline data will be used for randomisation match: hospital classification, beds in stroke centre, and the number of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients within 7 days of stroke onset. Hospitals with \\<250 AIS cases per year will be excluded from the study. The primary outcome will be difference between intervention arm and control arm in the one-year stroke recurrence rate on the follow-up stage (post-intervention)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Stroke Recrudescence","Quality Improvement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hospitals in the intervention arm will receive a multilevel system intervention based on information platform","interventionNames":["Behavioral: multilevel system intervention based on information platform"]},{"label":"control arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Hospitals in the control arm will receive no intervention"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"multilevel system intervention based on information platform","description":"1.
