A short course of systemic antibiotic is recommended for prophylaxis.\n\nThis study intends to assess the safety and efficacy of 2 alternative mechanical non-invasive airway clearance techniques in the prevention of EO-VAP in an open label randomized pilot trial of 20 subjects per study group i.e., 60 cases. The interventions will be in place for 7 days and the observational periods will be 14 days.","detailedDescription":"Background. Patients with structural coma are at high risk of so-called early onset pneumonia (EOP). Incidence rates of up to 50% have been reported in patients with head trauma or stroke. The usual causative microorganisms belong to the normal upper airway flora like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza and Moraxella catarrhalis. EOP typically is not present at admission and develops after 2 to 7 days after endotracheal intubation.\n\nA short course of systemic antibiotic therapy and aspiration of subglottic secretions (ASS) are associated with significant reductions in EOP, although ASS does not prevent late-onset pneumonia. Non-invasive mechanical methods may avoid the use of prophylactic antibiotics and pain and injury to the tracheal mucosa caused by the conventional suctioning catheter.\n\nThe primary objectives of the present randomized pilot trial is to compare the prevention of respiratory tract infections during invasive mechanical ventilation and occurrence of device-associated adverse events of non-invasive mechanical airway clearance devices with standard of care in the ICU Department at Hospital Clinico San Carlos.\n\nSecondary objectives are duration of intubation and respiratory support (mechanical intubation plus high flow nasal cannula).\n\nMethods. Informed consent will be requested from relatives in patients admitted to intensive care (Neuro-trauma unit) requiring endotracheal intubation estimated to last \\>48 hours, who do not have a hopeless prognosis.\n\nClosed envelopes will be used for allocation to one of the 3 study groups::\n\n1. Control group: ceftriaxone 2 g/24 hours, 3 doses\n2. Subglottic aspiration of secretions\n3. Cough simulator\n\nPatients in all groups will receive the topical components of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) while intubated.\n\nIn groups 2 and 3 the allocated study group prevention intervention will be applied during the first 7 days.\n\nThe main study objectives will be monitored over the first 14 days of intubation or until extubation if performed before day 14.\n\nSample size will be 60 subjects, 20 per study group, enrolled in blocs of 5, with the 5th case of each bloc being allocated in random sequence.\n\nNurses will be trained in using the devices for groups 2 and 3 before the start of enrollment phase.\n\nThe diagnosis of pneumonia vs tracheobronchitis will be based on chest x-ray and confirmed by lung ultrasound to exclude chest x-ray false negatives.\n\nOn day 5 to 7 or immediately before extubation, if planned earlier, electrical impedance tomography will be performed to compare lung air distribution and compliance between groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intubation Complication","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Head Trauma","Cardiac Arrest","Ventilator Associated Pneumonia","Airway Clearance Impairment"],"keywords":["ventilator-associated pneumonia","prevention","airway clearance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Open label randomized","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV ceftriaxone/24 hours 3 doses","interventionNames":["Device: airway clearance"]},{"label":"Subglottic aspiration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Continuos aspiration of subglottic secretions","interventionNames":["Device: airway clearance"]},{"label":"Cough Simulator","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical exsufflator","interventionNames":["Device: airway clearance"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"airway clearance","description":"mechanical suctioning of airway secretions","armGroupLabels":["Cough Simulator","Standard of Care","Subglottic aspiration"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence density of Respiratory tract infection per 1000 days of intubation","description":"ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheobronchitis","timeFrame":"inclusion to day 14"},{"measure":"Incidence of adverse events","description":"Device-related complications","timeFrame":"inclusion to day 14"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Duration of Respiratory support","description":"Duration of mechanical ventilation plus high-flow nasal cannula","timeFrame":"inclusion until ICU discharge or death"},{"measure":"Systemic antibiotic use","description":"Number of patients needing antibiotic therapy for respiratory tract infection and antimicrobial DDDs","timeFrame":"inclusion to day 14"},{"measure":"Incidence and type of Bacterial resistance","description":"Identification of resistance bacteria in respiratory tract samples","timeFrame":"14 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Endotracheal intubation anticipated to last \\>48 hours\n* Stroke\n* Severe Trauma\n* Head Trauma\n* Resuscitated cardiac arrest\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ominous prognosis\n* Limitation of Life support","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Miguel Sánchez Garcia, MD.
