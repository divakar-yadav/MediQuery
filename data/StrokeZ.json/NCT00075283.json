The first group will receive one hour of conventional gait training, consisting of lower extremity strengthening exercises, stretching, and full weight bearing walking as tolerated, with appropriate physical assistance from a therapist. The second group will receive walking therapy using a Lokomat, which is a special treadmill that works in conjunction with 2 light-weight robotic arms that assists the subject to move their legs while they try to walk on the treadmill. Some of the subject's body-weight will be supported using a harness. During Lokomat training sessions, subjects will receive feedback of their walking performance on a computer monitor to help them walk. Both groups will be trained for 8-10 weeks, 3 times per week, for 1 hour training sessions (24 total sessions). Resources for transportation to the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be provided to all study participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Physical Therapy","Locomotion therapy","Gait training","Stroke","Robotics","Rehabilitation","Treadmill","Hemiparetic stroke","Unilateral brain lesion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Lokomat (Robotic Orthosis) combined with slat belt treadmill"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion:\n\n* Unilateral brain lesion.\n* Within 6 months post-stroke.\n* Receiving no other therapy targeting function of lower limb.\n* Demonstration of hemiparesis (motor dysfunction in lower limb).\n* Able to walk 5 meters without therapist assistance (walking device only).\n* Able to follow commands and protocol.\n\nExclusion:\n\n* Significant cognitive or communication impairments.\n* Uncontrolled hypertension.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes.\n* Clinical depression.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Cheryl M Lacsamana, BBE","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(202)877-1889","email":"cheryl.lacsamana@medstar.net"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Dr. Joseph M Hidler, Ph.D.","affiliation":"The Catholic University of America","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"National Rehabilitation Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Washington","state":"District of Columbia","zip":"20010","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Cheryl M Lacsamana, BBE","role":"CONTACT","phone":"202-877-1889","email":"cheryl.lacsamana@medstar.net"},{"name":"Dr. Joseph M Hidler, Ph.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":38.89511,"lon":-77.03637}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
