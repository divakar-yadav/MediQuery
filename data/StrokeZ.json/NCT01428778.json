All participants will undergo brain MRI examinations to detect cerebral lesions within days before and after the marathon race, respectively. Moreover, serial blood samples will be taken a few days before, immediately after as well as a few days after the BMW-Berlin Marathon."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Arrhythmia","Brain Lesion","Stroke"],"keywords":["Marathon running","Brain MRI","ECG recording","Blood tests"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Whole blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of cardiac arrhythmias in marathon runners detected by mobile ECG-recording","description":"During ECG recording","timeFrame":"Up to 48 hours after the marathon race."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of (clinically silent) cerebral lesions detected by 3 Tesla brain MRI.","description":"Up to 3 days after marathon.","timeFrame":"3 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 35-65 years\n* at least 2 marathon runs within the last 5 years\n* weekly running of at least 40 km\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known cardiac arrhythmia or prior stroke\n* contraindication for MRI.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Experienced marathon runners","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Karl Georg Haeusler, MD","affiliation":"Center for Stroke Research Berlin, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Matthias Endres, MD","affiliation":"Center for Stroke Research Berlin, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"},{"name":"Wilhelm Haverkamp, MD","affiliation":"Departement of Cardiology, Campus Virchow, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"},{"name":"Matthias Kruell, MD","affiliation":"Medical Institute BMW-Berlin Marathon","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"},{"name":"Peter U Heuschmann, MD","affiliation":"Center for Stroke Research Berlin","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"},{"name":"Gerhard Jan Jungehuelsing, MD","affiliation":"Center for Stroke Research Berlin","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Center for Stroke Research Berlin","city":"Berlin","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.52437,"lon":13.41053}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28775185","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Herm J, Topper A, Wutzler A, Kunze C, Krull M, Brechtel L, Lock J, Fiebach JB, Heuschmann PU, Haverkamp W, Endres M, Jungehulsing GJ, Haeusler KG.
