Blacks, both nationally and among Harlem residents, have a twofold increase in recurrent strokes. Harlem Latinos have a threefold increase in risk relative to Whites.\n\nPrimary risk factors for recurrent stroke include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and under use of anti-thrombotic agents. Controlling risk factors can be particularly challenging for low-income, minority populations who lack the resources needed to adhere to necessary therapies. In Harlem, 72% of adults studied six months post stroke did not have these three risk factors treated adequately.\n\nWe propose to determine if participation in a recurrent stroke prevention educational intervention, versus usual care, can activated stroke survivors to at reduce primary risk factors for recurrent strokes while providing an effective, low-cost, sustainable recurrent stroke prevention program in neighborhoods like Harlem, whose residents bear a disproportionate burden of suffering from strokes. Specifically, we propose:\n\n1. Recruit 600 adults who sustained a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past five years by working with Harlem community leaders, local clinical sites including the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Institute for Family Health, and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York;\n2. To conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine if participation in a peer-led stroke prevention program activates stroke and TIA survivors to improve their knowledge and self-management strategies and treatments related to stroke prevention; and\n3. To rigorously compare the impact of the intervention with usual care (delayed intervention), on increasing the proportion of individuals with strokes and TIAs who are appropriately treated to reduce the risk of recurrent events, specifically through control of hypertension (blood pressure ≤ 140/90mmHg), hyperlipidemia (LDL cholesterol≤100 mg/dl) and use of anti-thrombotic medicines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Recurrence","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Stroke Recurrence Prevention","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Ischemia","Brain Infraction","Brain Diseases","Cerebral Infraction","Self-management","Peer-led","Community Based"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Peer-Led Stroke Recurrence Prevention Education","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will participate in a 6-session course held over a 6-week period.
