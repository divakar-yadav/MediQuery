The first dose will be given intravenously. Subsequent doses will be given orally every 24 hours for a total of five doses. The study will test to see if the medication is safe in intracerebral hemorrhage. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in intracerebral hemorrhage will be determined and the impact of minocycline on blood biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Hemorrhagic stroke","Hemorrhage","Minocycline"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Minocycline","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This intervention arm will receive a total of 5 doses of Minocycline.
