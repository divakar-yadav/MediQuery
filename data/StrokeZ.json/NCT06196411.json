When initial assessments will be completed, patients will be assigned to one of two possible sequences by simple randomization: study group (SG) or control group (CG).\n\nAll volunteers will recieve Bobath training program with the duration of 8 weeks. Additionally, task oriented training will be applied in SG, 5 days a week for 8 weeks.\n\nAll patients will be assessed in terms of motor functions and orientation, awareness, spatial perception, visuomotor construction, visual perception, praxis and thinking operations domains of cognitive funtions at the baseline and at the end of the study. Data will be collected from all the patients at baseline and at the end of the study (8 weeks) by the same physiotherapist who also will supervise the exercise sessions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Task-oriented training","Bobath training","Motor functions","Cognitive functions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Task-oriented Training Bobath Training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Task-oriented Training","Behavioral: Bobath Training"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Bobath Training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Bobath Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Task-oriented Training","description":"Task-oriented training will be applied to study group 5 days a week, for a total of 6 weeks, in addition to Bobath training.
