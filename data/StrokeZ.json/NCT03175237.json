This is a randomized uncontrolled blinded study, with 27 individuals in the chronic phase of stroke. Participants were randomized into two intervention groups: MT group with motor patterns of movement (MP, n=13) and MT group with specific functional activities (SA, n=14). Motor impairment assessments (Fugl-Meyer Assessment - FMA), motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and functionality (Functional Independence Measure - FIM) were performed before and after treatment, and 3 months after the end of sessions (follow-up). In each intervention group,there were patients classified with mild, moderate or severe motor impairment, according to FMA. All participants performed 15 MT sessions, 3 times a week for 50 minutes each session.","detailedDescription":"Objective: To evaluate the benefits of Mirror Therapy (MT) and motivation in patients with different levels of post-stroke motor impairment with two different therapy protocols.
