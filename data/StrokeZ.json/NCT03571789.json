It is implanted bilaterally in the common carotid arteries from a thin needle under ultrasound guidance. The procedure is performed without general anesthesia and takes minutes. The safety, feasibility and tolerability of Vine™ will be evaluated. Patients who are eligible will receive Vine™ and will be followed-up for a year after device implantation.","detailedDescription":"CAPTURE is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial, designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and tolerability of the Vine™ permanent carotid filter. The trial will enroll up to 30 patients, and will be conducted in up to five sites worldwide. All enrolled patients will be invited for non-invasive follow-up tests and clinical evaluations according to the study protocol."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["AF"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vine™ implantation bilaterally in the common carotid arteries","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vine™ is a permanent carotid filter made from a single nitinol wire.
