The investigators propose this trial to study the clinical and radiological effects of therapeutic hypothermia in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravascular thrombectomy (IVT).","detailedDescription":"The study intervention is therapeutic hypothermia. After intubation, patients assigned to therapeutic hypothermia will receive central venous catheterization through right jugular vein or femoral vein depending on the cooling application and the unique needs, a flexible catheter will be inserted and iced saline will be circulated through the multiple balloons of the catheter in a closed-loop design to induce therapeutic hypothermia. This system also has a hydrophilic coating with heparin and a triple-lumen central venous catheter to satisfy the need of fluid or drug infusion, blood draw and central venous pressure monitoring. After central venous catheterization, patients assigned to TH will receive intravascular temperature management to achieve the target temperature of 34-35 °C, which is superior to surface methods in cooling performance in terms of faster rate of cooling, shorter induced cooling time, precise control during maintenance. Thereafter, hypothermia will be maintained for 24 hrs from the start of hypothermia. The patients will be rewarmed slowly at a rate of no greater than 0.5 °C every 4 h. What's more, patients in TH group will execute anti-shivering protocol during awaking and extubation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Therapeutic hypothermia, AIS, Neurological function prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Safety and efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with Intravascular thrombectomy is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, parallel-group interventional study.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"This trial is open labeled, the treatment allocation is known to the treating physicians and the patients"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":252,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normothermia arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients randomized to normothermia will be maintained at 36-37°C during the entire study period."},{"label":"Therapeutic hypothermia arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients assigned to TH will receive intravascular temperature management to achieve the target temperature of 34-35 °C","interventionNames":["Procedure: Therapeutic hypothermia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Therapeutic hypothermia","description":"The study intervention is therapeutic hypothermia.
