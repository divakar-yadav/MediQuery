Furthermore, the investigators will identify associations of deficits in sensory modalities with upper limb impairments, activities and participation at different time points after stroke. Identification of the sensory deficits, along with further insights in their relation with objective neurophysiological and neuroanatomical measures will contribute to the amelioration of goal-setting for the rehabilitation of upper extremity function after stroke. These functions are indispensable during several daily activities as well in different sports and leisure activities. This project is an important step towards a better delineating of treatment interventions for the upper limb and to a better guiding of individual needs for post-stroke treatment in the future."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"study participants","interventionNames":["Other: No intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention","armGroupLabels":["study participants"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in sensory function in upper limb from baseline up to 6 months post stroke","timeFrame":"6 months post stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in motor function in upper limb from baseline up to 6 months post stroke","timeFrame":"6 months post stroke"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"activity measure","description":"The investigators will use the ABILHAND Questionnaire, a measure of how well the hemiplegic arm and hand can be used in daily activities.","timeFrame":"6 months post stroke"},{"measure":"Activity measure","description":"The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) will be used to investigate the use of the hemiplegic arm in bimanual tasks after stroke.","timeFrame":"6 months after stroke"},{"measure":"Participation measure","description":"The quality of life will be measured using the Stroke Impact Scale.","timeFrame":"6 months after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* first-ever stroke as defined by WHO\n* ≤ 5 days post stroke\n* motor impairment and/or a sensory impairment\n* ≥ 18 years old\n* sufficient cooperation to execute evaluations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* other neurological impairments such as previous stroke, head injury or multiple sclerosis (these might affect sensory ability independently of the stroke)\n* stroke-like symptoms caused by subdural hematoma, tumour, encephalitis or trauma\n* no informed consent\n* pre-stroke Barthel Index \\< 95 out of 100 points (to be able to distinguish between pre-existing disabilities and disabilities resulting from the stroke)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"stroke patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Geert Verheyden, Professor","affiliation":"Catholic University Leuven","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Sarah Meyer, PhD student","affiliation":"Catholic University Leuven","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UZ Leuven","city":"Leuven","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.87959,"lon":4.70093}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
