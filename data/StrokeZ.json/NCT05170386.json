Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most people engage in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'. The questionnaire takes no more than 2 or 3 minutes to answer. It is available in many different languages.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Pittsburgh sleep quality index ( PSQI)","description":"0 self-reported items Minimum score: o; Maximum score: 21 0-3 scoring for each of the 7 components Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality\n\n• 7 components/sub-scales: subjective sleep qualitv, sleep latenev, sleep duration.\n\nhabitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)","description":"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairmen Any score of 24 or more (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition.
