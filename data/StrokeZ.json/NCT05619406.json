Beyond the personal toll, costs related to stroke are prohibitive and threaten to erode the recent economic gains in Africa where the stroke is a major threat to brain health, brain capital and human capital. The surge in stroke burden in Africa is driven by an unprecedented rise in precursory modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\nThere is an urgent need to deploy evidence-based approaches using the best available context-specific data to surmount the stroke epidemic on the continent by developing population-wide preventive interventions. Achieving this goal requires tackling key barriers to stroke prevention such as lack of awareness and self-directed action to control its risk factors.\n\nSystematic Investigation of Blacks With Stroke (SIBS-GENOMICS) is poised to utilize the best available context-specific data on stroke in Africa to improve, validate, and co-create the first ever Afrocentric stroke riskometer mobile phone application, a self-management tool for stroke prevention. The app, along with a tailored co-created stroke prevention motivational video and educational modules with customized behavioral change activities, will be evaluated for effectiveness to improve individual stroke risk factor awareness and control in the first-of-its-kind randomized control trial (RCT) for a digital tool for primary stroke prevention in Africa.\n\nWith the scarcity of acute care and rehabilitation services, coupled with the chronic economic burden imposed by stroke, prevention is evidently the best option towards reducing its burden in Africa. This is concordant with the core mission of the NINDS to reduce the burden of stroke in the USA and globally through translational research and innovation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Adult","Dyslipidemias","Physical Inactivity","Diabetes","Alcohol Consumption"],"keywords":["Stroke-free adults","Riskometer App","Africans"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The relational data model is adopted in the Model component of the system","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The investigator and outcome assessor will be blinded","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The Control Group will be screened at baseline and be informed of their risk factors.
