However, acute complications such as high postoperative perfusion injury, hemorrhagic transformation and restenosis resulted in functional independence in only about 50% of patients 90 days after interventional surgery. Therefore, it is very important to protect the neurologic function after emergency endovascular treatment. The investigators' previous studies have shown that combined with intravenous thrombolytic therapy and remote postconditioning（RIPC）can significantly improve the neurological impairment and short-term and long-term prognosis in patients with acute stroke. In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, the investigators assumed patients with acute ischemic stroke who had successfully revascularization after ET might benefit from RIPC as well. Patients in the RIPC group had five cycles of 5-min cuff inflation followed by 3-min deflation to the bilateral upper arm after ET. The primary endpoint measure was the proportion of patients with a favorable recovery of nerve function deficient assessed by Modified Rankin Scale （mRS≤2） 90 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included the following: (1) Symptom endpoints: Neurological intelligence and function scores, postoperative hemorrhagic transformation rate, etc. (2) Blood index test: postoperative inflammatory factors, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and other indicators. (3) Imaging endpoints: MRI-FLAIR , TCD, etc."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular
