Also check its correlation with Functional independence measure and Katz index of Activities of Daily Living.","detailedDescription":"The English version of the Barthel index will be translated and traditionally adapted as prior endorsement. In Activities of Daily Livings disabled stroke population, Urdu Version of Modified Barthel Index will distributed among sixty participants choose by convenience sampling technique based on pre-distinct inclusion and exclusion standards. To test inter and intra-observer reliability of the final Urdu Version of Modified Barthel Index will be completed on the same day, by two observers, and for the inter-observers evaluation, with an interval of 30 minute between the first and the second submission. Third evaluation will be carried out after 7 days by Observer-1, for intra-observer assessment. Data will be entered and analyzed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences Version 24. Core steadiness will be analyzed with Cronbach alpha value. Test-retest reliability will be evaluated using an intra-class correlation coefficient.The Urdu Version of Modified Barthel Index will be evaluated for content validity, construct validity, criterion validity and responsiveness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Modified Barthel index","Urdu Version","Reliability","Validity","Cerebrovascular Disease","Stroke","Activities of Daily Living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index","description":"Modified Barthel Index explained 10 tasks and scores are according to time and assistance needed by the patient between total score from 0 to 20.Lower score describes greater assistance, and larger score tells less assistance required by patient.","timeFrame":"1st day"},{"measure":"Functional Independence Measure","description":"Functional Independence Measure was developed with 18-items that includes, 7-level ordinal scale, with 1 representing dependence and 7 representing independence.
