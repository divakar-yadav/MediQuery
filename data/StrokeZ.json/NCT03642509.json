Oral anticoagulation is the mainstay therapy; however, it increases the risk of bleeding. Moreover, 30% with AF and at risk of stroke are not in relevant anticoagulation. The randomized PROTECT-AF trial has demonstrated the superiority of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) as compared to warfarin for prevention of the combined endpoint of stroke, major bleeding and cardiovascular mortality. However, studies comparing LAAO to therapy with novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have not been carried out.\n\nThis study aims to assess the effect of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) to reduce the incidence of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding and all-cause mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).","detailedDescription":"An investigator-initiated multicenter, randomized open-label non-inferiority trial with blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE design). The active comparison LAAO is tested against NOAC therapy in a 1:1 stratified randomization. Patients should have AF, and an ischemic stroke or TIA within 6 months prior to enrollment. In total 750 patients will be included. Follow-up will be based on in-office and telephone follow-up during the first 3 years after randomization, along with up to 10 years long-term follow-up through the National Patient Registries.\n\nThe main study outcomes: The primary outcome is a composite of stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic), systemic embolism, major bleeding or all-cause mortality assessed after at least two years follow-up for the last enrolled patient. Secondary outcomes will examine early and late safety outcome measures. The long-term outcome will be assessed up to 10-years after randomization through the National Patient Registries."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Left atrial appendage occlusion","Novel oral anticoagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Open-label study with blinded outcome assessment by an independent clinical event committee","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":750,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LAAO group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be treated with transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion.
