PFO-closure was effective in preventing stroke in young stroke patients less than age 60 presented as an embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). However, the benefit of PFO-closure in elderly ESUS patients is not clear. The investigators designed this prospective register-based observational study to verify the efficacy of PFO-closure in elderly ESUS patients with high-risk PFO, older than 60 years","detailedDescription":"The COACH-ELDERLY ESUS study is a multicenter, prospective, registry-based, observational study in elderly ESUS patients with high-risk PFO treated with PFO-closure + standard antiplatelet treatment or standard antiplatelet treatment only in 20 centers in Korea.\n\nPatients will receive an insertable loop recorder (ILR) to monitor paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In cases, which are unavailable for ILR, recurrent EKG or Holter monitoring will be done based on the clinician's decision. Based on the attending physicians' decision with a multi-disciplinary approach, patients will receive PFO-closure with standard antiplatelet treatment or standard antiplatelet treatment only."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source"],"keywords":["insertable loop recorder","patent foramen ovale","patent foramen ovale closure","elderly"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: intervention group","description":"This group will receive PFO-closure and standard antiplatelet treatment PFO-closure will be performed after 3-6 months of observation and monitoring for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Standard antiplatelet treatment will be prescribed - aspirin 100mg and clopidogrel 75mg, once daily, principally.
