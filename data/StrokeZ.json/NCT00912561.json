risk stroke patients with impaired Cerebrovascular Reserve (CVR) due to high grade stenosis of the internal carotid (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) by Intense Aerobic Exercise (IAEx).","detailedDescription":"The primary objective: Intense aerobic exercise (24/8 weeks) improves CVR \\> 20% measured by Transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with hemodynamic relevant intra- or extracranial stenoses by enhanced cerebral arterio- and angiogenesis.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nIntense aerobic exercise (24/8 weeks) leads to:\n\n* an increase of Endothelial progenitor cell counts (EPCs)\n* qualitative and quantitative changes of endothelial markers and cytokines representing the inflammatory activity of atherosclerosis and neovascularisation\n* an improvement in cognitive performance and quality of life (QoL)\n* changes of the mean vessel size and of cerebral perfusion"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stenosis"],"keywords":["chronic brain ischaemia","stroke
