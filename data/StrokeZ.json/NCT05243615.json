Many may benefit from access to mental health services that target unhelpful thoughts, such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), but go untreated due to lack of access to specialized care, costs, remote location, or stigma related to seeking care. Internet Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) may overcome these barriers. The stroke ICBT program teaches skills such as challenging unhelpful thoughts, memory and attention, managing related physical symptoms, and pacing through a mix of online learning and weekly contact with a trained Guide. While the program's content was found to be acceptable among individuals after stroke, the program's effectiveness still needs to be evaluated. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate if the stroke ICBT program will improve symptoms of depression compared to an attention control group. Individuals in both groups will answer questions about themselves and their injury and describe symptoms of depression, quality of life, and health service use to evaluate its impact on people's wellbeing. The study results will be useful in determining if the ICBT program is effective and whether it should be part of routine clinical practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression","Anxiety"],"keywords":["Stroke","Depression","Anxiety","internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke internet delivered cognitive behavioural therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A 10-week internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) will be delivered to participants who have sustained a stroke.
