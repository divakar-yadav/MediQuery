Participants will receive general anesthesia induction with a target controlled infusion system and will be compared to patients receiving manual general anesthesia induction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke/Brain Attack","Anesthesia","Hemodynamic Instability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Participants undergoing intervention will be unaware of the intervetion Outcomes assessor will be not involted in the other study of the study and will be not aware of the intervention","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":224,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Manual induction","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"General Anesthesia induction: Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, Propofol 2 mg/kg, Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg General Anesthesia mainteneance: Propofol 4-6 mg/kg/h to keep an adequate sedation level (BIS between 40-60; entropy between 40-60)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Manual induction"]},{"label":"Target Controlled Induction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"General Anesthesia induction: Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, Propofol TCI with Schneider site effect model starting from 2 mcg/ml and increasing the dose untile loss of consciousness, Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg.\n\nGeneral Anesthesia mainteneance: Propofol TCI with Schneider site effect model in order to keep an adequate sedation level (BIS between 40-60; entropy between 40-60)","interventionNames":["Procedure: TCI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"TCI","description":"General anesthesia will be induced with a TCI pump","armGroupLabels":["Target Controlled Induction"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Manual induction","description":"General anestehsia will be induced and maintained using a pro kilo regimen.","armGroupLabels":["Manual induction"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients with Intraprocedural Hypotension","description":"Descrease of mean blood pressure \\> 20% during the procedure from the baseline","timeFrame":"Up to three hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke","description":"Change from baseline in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke.
