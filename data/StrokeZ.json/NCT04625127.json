To do so, the investigators will run a pilot study to gather feedback from stakeholders (not reported here).\n\nIn Aim 2, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of using the GaitBetter solution to improve motor-cognitive function of chronic stroke survivors. To do so, the investigators will run a single-arm, non-randomized study to test the hypothesis that the GaitBetter training is effective in improving gait and cognition in individuals with chronic stroke.\n\nIn Aim 3, the investigators will explore the efficacy of using the GaitBetter solution for improving rehabilitation outcomes in sub-acute stroke survivors. To do so, the investigators will run a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of using the GaitBetter system in patients with subacute stroke on recovery trajectory."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Gait","Falls"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aim 2: Efficacy of the GaitBetter to improve motor-cognitive function of chronic stroke survivors","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The investigators propose a single-arm, non-randomized study to test the hypothesis that the GaitBetter training is effective in improving gait and cognition in individuals with chronic stroke.
