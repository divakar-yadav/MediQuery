However, the results of previous studies have been inconsistent.\n\nObjectives: To investigate the associations between dietary intake of ALA, adipose tissue content of ALA, and the risk of the major atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and subtypes, and peripheral artery disease.\n\nMethods: This project will be based on data from the Danish cohort study Diet, Cancer and Health which consisted of 57,053 men and women at recruitment between 1993 and 1997. Dietary intake of ALA will be assessed using a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire and adipose tissue content will be determined with the use of gas chromatography analyses of adipose tissue biopsies collected at baseline. Also, detailed information on lifestyle factors, medical history and anthropometri was collected at baseline.\n\nIncident cases have been identified through national registries and the diagnoses have previously been validated.\n\nAnalyses of dietary intake of ALA will be analysed using a traditional cohort design, whereas analyses on adipose tissue content of ALA will be analysed based on a case-cohort design. Hazard ratioes with 95% confidence intervals will be used to describe the associations between the exposure variables and the outcome variables of interest."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Myocardial Infarction","Ischemic Stroke","Peripheral Artery Disease"],"keywords":["Alpha-linolenic acid","Dietary intake","Adipose tissue","Nutritional epidemiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Subcutaneous adipose tissue, serum, plasma, ''buffycoat'', erytrocytes and urine is stored in nitrogen vapour at the biobank of the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study.
