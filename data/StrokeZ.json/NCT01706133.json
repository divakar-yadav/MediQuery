Functional impairment may be a \"marker\" of the effect of systemic disease on the patient and is also an indicator of severity of disease because it measures the ability of independence\n\nThe accumulation of normal aging characteristics define a threshold, which once pierced, tends to increase the propensity for loss of functional abilities due to aging. However, not everyone ages the same way, since factors such as inherited genetic capital, especially the accumulation of risks associated with lifestyle and work activities, and the opportunity to identify the disease in its period latency coupled with the accessibility and use of health services, can delay or exacerbate the loss of functionality and increase the dependency of the elderly.\n\n* Quality of life of older\n\nFrailty in the elderly is a state of increased susceptibility due to less booking multiple physiological systems resulting in lower resilience, negative energy balance, sarcopenia, decreased strength and reduced exercise tolerance. Frailty is associated with adverse health outcomes such as institutionalization, falls, reduced performance status and increased mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Attack","Diabetes Mellitus","Hypertension","Fragility"],"keywords":["Frailty, emergency services, elderly"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1400,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Basal phase","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Integrated measurement of all variables involved impact and frequency of prior use of health services and specifically to the emergency room, service access, patient characteristics, features for the classification of frailty, cognitive impairment and depression, why consultation, triage scale level on admission to the service and to the service variables in terms of length of stay, diagnosis and medical management, and related services with internal consultants percentage of inpatients discharged or deceased, in further analysis the researchers undertake group estimating frequency of use and the identification of factors associated with the use of emergency departments and adverse events","interventionNames":["Other: Factors associated with the use of emergency departments"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Factors associated with the use of emergency departments","description":"Participants who were assigned to the intervention will be evaluated jointly by the medical service by a medical specialist in geriatrics and a nurse trained in gerontology and geriatrics.
