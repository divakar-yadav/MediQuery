Group II patients continued to take the same dose of statins they had been taking before (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) or if it had initially been low - increased doses of atorvastatin of up to 20 mg/d and rosuvastatin of up to 10 mg/d. Persons who had never taken that medicine before (subgroup Ib) were administered atorvastatin of 20 mg/day with the recommendation to take it for at least 90 days since the occurrence of SICH symptoms.

The options of treating SICH are limited and focus on containing arterial hypertension, treating cerebral edema and providing supportive care, primarily physical and speech therapy, as well as preventing complications in bed-ridden patients in grave medical condition. Therefore, neuroprotective effects of statins have become the subject of interest, especially in the case of diseases with low possibilities of treatment but catastrophic health and social consequences, caused by SICH.\n\nThe intended purpose of this work is to determine whether:\n\n1. the use of statins in the period prior to the spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage has any impact on the initial neurological condition and the initial radiology\n2. continuing the statin treatment commenced before the spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage or including statins into treatment at the acute stage of the disease deteriorates the course of the disease and prognosis during the in-hospital period\n3. continuing treatment with statins after the in-hospital treatment impacts functional efficiency and survival rate within the period of up to 90 days from the symptoms of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage occurring.\n\nThe prospective study included 153 patients with diagnosed SICH who met the criteria for inclusion based on data collected in the course of interviews, neurological examinations, neuroimaging (head scans or magnetic resonance of the head) and laboratory test results, which additionally made it possible to exclude secondary hemorrhage causes.\n\nDuring the first stage of the study, patients were assigned to group I (without statins) and group II (taking statins).\n\nDuring the second stage of the study, having marked the lipid profile within the first three days of stay in hospital and excluded or confirmed dyslipidemia, group I was further divided into subgroups Ia and Ib.
