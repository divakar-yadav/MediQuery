Functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) has shown promise for functional enhancement of both upper and lower limb motor control following stroke. Gains included muscle activation latencies, strength, coordination, upper limb functional tasks, gait kinematics, walking endurance, and quality of life. The purpose of the proposed work is to test the radio frequency-controlled (RF) Microstimulator (RFM) Gait System regarding system performance and subject response to treatment.\n\nMethods: This is a feasibility study in which up to four subjects will receive the (RFM) Gait System. Up to ten RFMs will be placed for a given subject. An RFM ankle muscle system will be used to train ankle gait components. A separate RFM system will be used to train knee gait components. Subjects will be treated for 6 months, four sessions/wk. Primary outcome measures for the RFM Gait System will be: kinematic swing phase gait components and walking endurance. Secondary outcome measures will include: strength, coordination, spasticity, function, and quality of life. Data collections will occur at months 1, 3 and 6, and for follow-up times up to a year after the end of treatment. The results of the RFM ankle system have the potential to provide a new technology for ankle muscle gait components."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Functional Electrical Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"radio frequency-controlled (RF) Microstimulator (RFM) Gait System","interventionNames":["Device: radio frequency-controlled (RF) Microstimulator (RFM) Gait System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"radio frequency-controlled (RF) Microstimulator (RFM) Gait System","description":"Fully Implanted FES system to assist patient with gait component practice","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking Endurance (6MWT)","description":"The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a measure of the distance measured in feet ambulated by the participant during six minutes.
