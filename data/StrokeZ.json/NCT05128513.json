A recent study imply that the neuroprotective effect of DELP involved multiple neuroprotective mechanism such as anti-inflammation, free radical scavenging, and decreasing MMP-9. Based on the multiple mechanisms, the investigator argues that DELP may exert neuroprotective effect on acute cerebral hemorrhage (ACH). In this context, the prospective, random, open-label, blind-endpoint, multi-centre study is designed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":356,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DELP","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Delipid Extracorporeal Lipoprotein filter from Plasma (DELP) is a non-pharmacological therapy for acute stroke, which is approved by China Food and Drug Administration","interventionNames":["Device: DELP"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DELP","description":"The blood was pumped into the PCS2 plasma separator through one side of the forearm vein.

The total treatment plasma volume was 800-1,000 mL; the anticoagulant 4% sodium citrate dehydrate solution with a ratio of 1:16 to plasma, was dropped before pumping. To prevent hypocalcemia, 500 mg CaCl2 diluted with 250 mL physiological saline was infused at a rate of 150 mL/h, in the first cycle of the returning blood transfusion.","armGroupLabels":["DELP"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0 to 2","description":"the minimum and maximum values of modified Rankin Score are 0 and 6, respectively;
