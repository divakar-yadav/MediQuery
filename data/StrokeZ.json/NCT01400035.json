The patients with cerebral infarction are as the study objects. Coronal CT / MRI examination combined with NIHSS and Modified Ranking Scale, MMSE, Barthel index, Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination are applied to evaluate the Vinpocetine treatment efficacy and safety for cerebral infarction \\[14\\]. From ethical side, all patients will receive a conventional therapy, and based on it, the test group will be given intravenous injection of Vinpocetine as add-on treatment.
