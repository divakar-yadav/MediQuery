To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: \"Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.\"","timeFrame":"session 0 (initial visit); session 10 (at approximately 4 weeks); after 4 weeks from intervention termination (follow-up)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Berg Balance Scale (BBS)","description":"Measurement of balance function. A five-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0-4. \"0\" indicates the lowest level of function and \"4\" the highest level of function. Score the lowest performance.

These outcomes are measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor hotspot. The rMT is defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that produced a minimal motor evoked response at rest. The amplitude means peak to peak of the muscle response.","timeFrame":"session 0 (initial visit); session 10 (at approximately 4 weeks); after 4 weeks from intervention termination (follow-up)"},{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"The score is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.

This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device.
