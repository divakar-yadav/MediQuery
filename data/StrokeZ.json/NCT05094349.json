Outcome is related to the severity of the initial bleeding and delayed cerebral infarction (DCI). Infection and more precisely pneumonia have been associated with poor outcome in SAH. However, the interaction between the two pathologic events remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that DCI may be associated to pneumonia in SAH patients. Thus the aim of the study is to analyze the association between delayed cerebral infarction and pneumonia in patients with SAH.\n\nRetrospective, observational, monocentric cohort study, including patient admitted in Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit or Surgical Intensive Care Unit in the University Hospital of Brest (France) for non-traumatic SAH. Primary outcome is diagnosis of DCI on CT scan or MRI 3 months after SAH. Multivariate analysis is used to identify factors independently associated with DCI.\n\nWe plan to include between 200 and 250 patients in the analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Pneumonia, Bacterial"],"keywords":["Subarachnoid hemorrhage","pneumonia","delayed cerebral ischemia","vasospasm","delayed cerebral infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":224,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"delayed cerebral infarction","description":"infarction on CT or MRI not related to initial bleeding","timeFrame":"3 months from subarachnoid hemorrhage"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* admitted in ICU in Brest University Hospital\n* for non traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage\n* between july 2015 and december 2018\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* continuation of care out of Brest University Hospital after initial ICU stay\n* refusal to participate","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patient admitted to ICU for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). in our institution every patient diagnosed with non traumatic SAH are admitted for at least 24 hours in ICU.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHRU de Brest","city":"Brest","zip":"29609","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.3903,"lon":-4.48628}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"All collected data that underlie results in a publication","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL"],"timeFrame":"Data will be available beginning 2 years and ending five years following the end of study","accessCriteria":"Data access requests will be reviewed by the internal committee of Brest UH.
