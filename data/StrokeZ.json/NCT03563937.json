Nevertheless, it is known that clinicians often hesitate to prescribe NOACs to patients with even moderate renal impairment. Therefore, it is important to investigate effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban and other NOACs compared to vitamin-K antagonists in NVAF patients with renal dysfunction in real life setting.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are to describe the risk of ischemic stroke (IS)/ systemic embolism (SE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and renal impairment initiating treatment with individual NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) compared to phenprocoumon."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64920,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phenprocoumon","description":"Patients with NVAF who initiated the treatment of Phenprocoumon.","interventionNames":["Drug: Phenprocoumon"]},{"label":"Apixaban","description":"Patients with NVAF who initiated the treatment of Apixaban.","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban"]},{"label":"Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)","description":"Patients with NVAF who initiated the treatment of Rivaroxaban.","interventionNames":["Drug: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)"]},{"label":"Edoxaban","description":"Patients with NVAF who initiated the treatment of Edoxaban.","interventionNames":["Drug: Edoxaban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Phenprocoumon","description":"Follow the physician's prescription.","armGroupLabels":["Phenprocoumon"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"2.5 mg or 5 mg, twice daily","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)","description":"15 mg or 20 mg, once daily","armGroupLabels":["Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edoxaban","description":"30 mg or 60 mg, once daily","armGroupLabels":["Edoxaban"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Risk of Ischemic stroke (IS) / Systemic embolism(SE) (as combined endpoint and alone), recurrent IS/SE (as combined endpoint) and severe IS in patients with NVAF and renal impairment determined by inpatient claims based diagnoses","description":"Severe IS will be defined according to an approach proposed by Schubert et al. as hospitalization with a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of IS in combination with an OPS (Operationen und Prozedurenschl√ºssel) code indicating one of the following: intubation, mechanical ventilation or percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy","timeFrame":"Retrospective analysis from January 2012 -
