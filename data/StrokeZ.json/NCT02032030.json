Based on our own data from the B-Unaware (NCT00281489) and BAG-RECALL (NCT00682825) clinical trials, 30-day postoperative mortality among high-risk surgical patients is comparable to this at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and 1-year mortality among high-risk surgical patients may be as high as 10%. Short- and intermediate-term postoperative mortality is therefore a pressing public health concern. Similarly, postoperative major morbidity - including delirium, stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, blood clots, renal dysfunction, wound infection, pneumonia, respiratory failure, loss of functionality, and chronic pain - occurs commonly and affects a substantial proportion of surgical patients, critically ill patients and patients undergoing procedures for chronic pain. Many factors associate strongly and independently with postoperative mortality and major morbidity: patient age, functional status, comorbid medical conditions, and duration and invasiveness of surgery, among others. It is a strategic priority to identify pre- and intraoperative risk factors that are subject to modification.","detailedDescription":"The overarching purpose of SATISFY-SOS is to implement a rigorous process to assess short-term and intermediate-term outcomes of surgical and procedural patients who receive anesthesia services at Barnes-Jewish Hospital facilities, located in St. Louis, Missouri. Specifically, patients will be followed for major morbidity events, for mortality, and for quality of life up to a year following their procedures. Patients receiving anesthesia services will provide informed consent to participate in SATISFY-SOS. Each patient will have the opportunity to respond to a baseline quality of life survey as well as to two comprehensive post-procedure surveys. These surveys are conducted by either email, mail or via a telephone interview at 30-90 days post-procedure and again at one year. The survey questions are primarily comprised of standardized, validated, non-proprietary survey tools covering the following topics: general health, mental health, emotional health, physical health, pain, falls, major morbidity, and cognition.\n\nIn addition to collecting patient-reported outcomes, comprehensive medical record information for each patient beginning with the preoperative assessment and spanning throughout the surgery or procedure, hospitalization period, time spent in intensive care and follow-up clinic visits is incorporated into the database. Additionally, mortality data including cause of death for all patients will be ascertained via the National Death Index and from information in hospital records. This allows for meaningful, comprehensive electronic data query capabilities. Under the umbrella of the SATISFY-SOS initiative, we intend to implement specific evidence-based and patient-centered quality improvement programs, and to ensure that they are effective when implemented in routine clinical care. Additionally, future IRB-approved research projects can utilize de-identified SATISFY-SOS data.\n\nAll electronic data are collected from existing clinical records. The primary SATISFY-SOS database is hosted on a firewall-secured, HIPAA-compliant server within the Department of Anesthesiology at Washington University School of Medicine and maintained and managed by the departmental IT team. Access to the SATISFY-SOS data is restricted from web access and limited to only the project Informaticist, Data Manager, and Director.\n\nRegular internal auditing of the data are conducted for validity and completeness on a monthly basis. On an annual basis, the consent process is audited. The data entered early in the registry are compared with data entered subsequently. Sensitivity analyses are performed to determine whether data are missing at random. It is planned to compare the data obtained from patient-reported outcomes against a sample of data in the medical records and against data obtained from a sample of patients contacted again by telephone. A data dictionary for key data fields is currently being compiled. Standard operating procedures have been developed for registry operations, patient recruitment, data collection, data management and data analysis. No adverse events attributable to this activity are envisioned. Multiple outcomes are being tracked; no specific sample size has been calculated. Sensitivity analyses are planned for missing or unavailable data. No imputation is currently planned. The statistical analyses will depend on the variables and outcomes of interest. This registry is currently IRB-approved for total enrollment of 36,000 patients. This is subject to subsequent expansion, pending IRB approval."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Attack","Cardiac Arrest","Congestive Heart Failure","Atrial Fibrillation","Angina","Deep Vein Thrombosis","Pulmonary Embolism","Respiratory Arrest","Respiratory Failure","Pneumonia","Gastrointestinal Bleed","Stomach Ulcer","Delirium","Stroke","Nerve Injury","Surgical Wound Infection"],"keywords":["quality of Life","pain","nausea","falls","intraoperative awareness","anesthesia awareness","cognition","activities of daily living","major morbidity","all-cause mortality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":73952,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"quality of life","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"functional health","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"falls","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"cognition","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"emotional health","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"mental health","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"physical health","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"pain","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"intraoperative awareness","timeFrame":"30-90 days"},{"measure":"all-cause mortality","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"surgical wound infection","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"nerve injury","timeFrame":"30-90 days"},{"measure":"stroke","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"delirium","timeFrame":"30-90days"},{"measure":"Stomach Ulcer","timeFrame":"30-90 days"},{"measure":"Gastrointestinal Bleed","timeFrame":"30-90 days"},{"measure":"Pneumonia","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Respiratory Failure","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Respiratory Arrest","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Pulmonary Embolism","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Deep Vein Thrombosis","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Angina","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Atrial Fibrillation","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Congestive Heart Failure","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Cardiac Arrest","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Heart Attack","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Return to Work","description":"Return to work after surgery","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Surgical and procedural patients who require anesthesia services\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients under the age of 18 years","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We are attempting to recruit all-comers visiting our preoperative assessment clinic, with current daily enrollment rates approaching 60%.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Michael S Avidan, MBBCh, FCASA","affiliation":"Washington University School of Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Anshuman Sharma, MD","affiliation":"Washington University School of Medicine","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Daniel Helsten, MD","affiliation":"Washington University School of Medicine","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Arbi Ben Abdallah, PhD","affiliation":"Washington University School of Medicine","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Troy Wildes, MD","affiliation":"Washington University School of Medicine","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Barnes-Jewish Hospital","city":"Saint Louis","state":"Missouri","zip":"63110","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.62727,"lon":-90.19789}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20418692","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Kertai MD, Pal N, Palanca BJ, Lin N, Searleman SA, Zhang L, Burnside BA, Finkel KJ, Avidan MS; B-Unaware Study Group.
