Results will be collected using standardized outcome measures and a transcranial magnetic stimulation assessment protocol including electrical stimulation and electromyographic recording.","detailedDescription":"The working hypothesis for this pre-post intervention study is that one session of AMPS will increase voluntary motor drive of the plantar-flexors (soleus) muscle. The primary outcome measure will be maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the soleus (measured by electromyography, EMG); the secondary outcome will be the MVC of the antagonist muscle, the tibialis anterior. Data will be collected before the first session compared to directly after. The same measures in sham-stimulated and healthy volunteers will serve as controls."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke","Cerebral Palsy","Parkinson's Disease"],"keywords":["ambulation","sensory stimulation","mobility","neurological disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Twenty adult individuals in the chronic phase of stroke, 20 people with cerebral palsy, 20 with Parkinson's Disease (intermediate stage) and 20 healthy volunteers will be randomized to receive sham or real AMPS intervention.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"A blinded evaluator will collect all the demographic (age, gender, time since injury, injury type), clinical and functional data of the participants.
