Spasticity is a common condition in stroke patients and has a negative impact on daily living activities. BTX-A has been successfully used in the treatment of spasticity in patients with stroke. ESWT is a physical therapy method applying high intensity pressure waves.\n\nESWT has been increasingly used in the management of spasticity as a safe and effective method, but the literature about ESWT in spasticity is heterogeneous and the treatment protocols are not very clear about the number of applications.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the effects of rESWT treatment on ankle plantar flexors spasticity applied after BTX-A injection.","detailedDescription":"In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, 45 patient (aged 18-75) diagnosed as stroke with appropriate criteria will be included.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be seperated into three groups with the randomizer.org randomization program.\n\nGroup I: A single session of rESWT will be applied on the same day after BTX-A injection.\n\nGroup II: A total of 2 sessions of rESWT will be applied on the same day after BTX-A injection and on the 7th day after BTX-A injection.\n\nGroup III: A single session of placebo rESWT will be applied after BTX-A injection.\n\nBTX-A injections to gastrocnemius and soleus muscles will be performed under ultrasonography guidance. rESWT will be applied to the injection points in gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.\n\nThe pressure pulses will be focused on the injection site in the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle and the soleus muscle. (Number of pulses: 1500 pulses, frequency: 6 Hz, Energy level/Pressure: 2.2 bar air pressure, duration: 12 minutes) Patients will be evaluated by the same researcher before treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 1 month after treatment and 3 months after treatment.\n\nPatients will be evaluated using the Modified Ashworth Scale, Modified Tardieu Scale, Visual Analog Scale, 10 m walk test, Timed Up and Go Test, Timed Sit and Go Test, Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index, Functional Ambulation Scale, Brunnstrom Staging."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke"],"keywords":["spasticity","ESWT","Botulinum Toxin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ESWT once","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A single session of rESWT will be applied on the same day after BTX-A injection.","interventionNames":["Device: Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy ONCE"]},{"label":"ESWT twice","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A total of 2 sessions of rESWT will be applied on the same day after BTX-A injection and on the 7th day after BTX-A.","interventionNames":["Device: Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy ONCE","Device: Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy TWİCE"]},{"label":"Sham ESWT","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"A single session of placebo rESWT will be applied after BTX-A injection.","interventionNames":["Device: Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy SHAM"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy ONCE","description":"rESWT application ONCE The points where rESWT will be applied will be determined under ultrasonography guidance.
