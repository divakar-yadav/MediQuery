The CER_PAS approach may be more effective than V_PAS as the cerebellum plays a major role in the post-stroke recovery\n* This improvement would be explained by an effect on brain reorganization by increasing the proportion of activation in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex comparing to the contralesional side, as well as strengthening the relationships between ipsilesional premotor and motor cortices.\n* Clinical and electrophysiological effects observed in the combined approach are correlated with specific characteristics of the sensorimotor network assessed by MRI.\n\nPerspectives Demonstrating beneficial effects would subsequently consider protocols in order to achieve a therapeutic effect in the long term. The low cost greatly facilitates the implementation of feasible treatments in routine care in specialized centers (or pilot research centers) and potentially useful in many patients. The study of the characteristics of responders and non-responders patients would provide \"patient-oriented\" treatment, which take into account the particularities of each subject."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke and Healthy Subjects"],"keywords":["transcranial magnetic stimulation","movement disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"V_PAS","description":"Visuomotor paired associative stimulation protocol","interventionNames":["Device: PAS"]},{"label":"Sham V_PAS","description":"Placebo group of Visuomotor paired associative stimulation protocol"},{"label":"CER_PAS","description":"cerebellar-motor associative stimulation protocol","interventionNames":["Device: PAS"]},{"label":"Sham CER_PAS","description":"Placebo group of cerebellar-motor associative stimulation protocol"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"PAS","armGroupLabels":["CER_PAS","V_PAS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in lateralization indices in the primary motor cortex using functional magnetic Resonance","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to day 5 (Pre and post intervention)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in motor score of the affected hand by the Jebsen Taylor Test","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to day 5 (Pre and post intervention)"},{"measure":"change in corticospinal excitability by the motor evoked potentials","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to day 5 (Pre and post intervention)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria FOR PATIENTS:\n\n* First event ischemic stroke with hand motor deficit\n* Time since stroke \\> 30 days\n* Stroke lesion sparing the primary motor cortex (hand knob area)\n* Age between 18 and 85 ans\n\nExclusion Criteria FOR PATIENTS:\n\n* No homonymous hemianopia\n* No contra-indications for TMS and MRI\n* Pregnancy\n* Epilepsia\n* Any pathology that threatened the 1 month follow up\n\nInclusion Criteria FOR HEALTHY SUBJECTS:\n\n* Age between 18 and 85\n* Right handed\n\nExclusion Criteria FOR HEALTHY SUBJECTS\n\n* No contra-indications for TMS and MRI\n* Pregnancy\n* Any cerebral pathology or pathology that threatened the 1 month follow up","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Charlotte ROSSO, PI","role":"CONTACT","phone":"42161854","phoneExt":"+331","email":"charlotte.rosso@gmail.com"},{"name":"Sophie CORIOU, INSERM","role":"CONTACT","phone":"42165778","phoneExt":"+331","email":"sophie.coriou@inserm.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Charlotte ROSSO, PI","affiliation":"Brain and Spine institute, INSERM UMR 1127, CNRS 7225","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"ICM, CIC Neurosciences","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Paris","zip":"75013","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35226342","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Rosso C, Moulton EJ, Kemlin C, Leder S, Corvol JC, Mehdi S, Obadia MA, Obadia M, Yger M, Meseguer E, Perlbarg V, Valabregue R, Magno S, Lindberg P, Meunier S, Lamy JC.
