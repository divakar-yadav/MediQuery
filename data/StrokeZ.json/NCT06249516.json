The score ranges from 1 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe penetration or aspiration events. A lower score indicates better swallowing function and less risk of airway invasion, while a higher score suggests more significant impairment and increased risk of aspiration.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Oral Intake Scale","description":"The Functional Oral Intake Scale is used to measure the level of oral intake and diet consistency in individuals with dysphagia. The score ranges from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating better functional oral intake and tolerance to a wider variety of food textures. A higher score indicates improved swallowing function and the ability to consume a better range of food consistencies, while a lower score suggests more significant impairments and a limited intake of oral food and liquids.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"},{"measure":"Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale","description":"The Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale is used to assess the severity of pharyngeal residue after swallowing. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating worse severity of pharyngeal residue. A higher score on the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale indicates a larger amount of residue remaining in the pharynx after swallowing, while a lower score suggests less residue and better swallowing efficiency.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"},{"measure":"Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale","description":"The Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale is used to assess the severity of swallowing disorders based on fiberoptic endoscopic examination. The score ranges from 1 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe swallowing impairment.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"},{"measure":"Murray Secretion Scale","description":"The Murray Secretion Scale is used to assess the amount and tenacity of tracheobronchial secretions. The score ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a greater amount and/or thicker consistency of secretions. A higher score indicates a higher volume or thicker consistency of tracheobronchial secretions, while a lower score suggests minimal secretion accumulation and easier secretion management.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"},{"measure":"Swallowing Quality of Life","description":"Swallowing Quality of Life is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess the impact of dysphagia on an individual's quality of life. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better swallowing-related quality of life. A higher score indicates a better quality of life related to swallowing function, while a lower score suggests a poorer quality of life and greater negative impact of dysphagia on daily activities and well-being.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosed with Respiratory Rhythm Disorder\n* age â‰¥ 18 years;\n* meeting the diagnostic criteria of stroke;\n* any degree of dysphagia at admission;\n* steady vital signs, without severe cognitive impairment or sensory aphasia, able to cooperate with the assessment.\n* transferred out within three weeks of hospitalization in the neurology department.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* complicated with other neurological diseases;\n* tracheostomy tube plugged;\n* unfeasible to the support of parenteral nutrition;\n* simultaneously suffering from liver, kidney failure, tumors, or hematological diseases.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Qianyun Lu, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"15333866454","email":"luqianyun@126.com"},{"name":"Weijia Li, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"13592505588","email":"liweijia@163.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nieto Luis, Master","affiliation":"Site Coordinator of United Medical Group located in Miami","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Mianyang Central Hospital","city":"Mianyang","state":"Henan","zip":"450000","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":31.46784,"lon":104.68168}},{"facility":"Zhengda Yi Hospital","city":"Zhengzhou","state":"Henan","zip":"450000","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Li Li, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"17455684595","email":"zdyfy@126.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":34.75778,"lon":113.64861}},{"facility":"Huashan University","city":"Shanghai","state":"Shanghai","zip":"200200","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":31.22222,"lon":121.45806}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000012120","term":"Respiration Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000012140","term":"Respiratory Tract Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26827","name":"Respiratory Aspiration","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14647","name":"Respiration Disorders","asFound":"Respiratory Rhythm Disorder","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M14667","name":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
