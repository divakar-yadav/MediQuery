Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved as standard of care for high-, intermediate and potentially even low surgical risk candidates due to a lower perioperative risk compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Despite its relative safety compared to SAVR, embolic events originating from the calcified valve and leading to ischemic stroke and acute renal injury are major complications following TAVI in the acute and subacute period, and are associated with increased morbidity including cognitive decline and mortality. While cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) such as the Sentinel® CEPD (Boston Scientific) were designed to reduce the burden of cerebral embolic events, their impact on clinical events has yet to be determined, and other prophylactic options are currently not available. Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a key pathophysiological mechanism involved in cerebral and renal embolic events after TAVI resulting in activation of endothelial cells, the contact activation and the complement system and attraction of neutrophils to the site of injury. In this regard, recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH, conestat alfa), a potent inhibitor of the complement and the contact system has been shown to reduce the size of cerebral ischemic damage and of renal injury in experimental IRI models, and has successfully been investigated in a pilot study of acute kidney injury following the administration of contrast media. The aim of the current trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of conestat alfa (Ruconest®, Pharming Technologies B.V.) on renal and cerebral ischemic events in patients undergoing TAVI for severe symptomatic AS compared to placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Acute Renal Injury"],"keywords":["Severe aortic stenosis (AS)","Valvular heart disease","Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)","cerebral embolic events","renal embolic events","Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI)","recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH, conestat alfa)","complement system","contact activation system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be randomized in two parallel groups to receive either conestat alfa or placebo.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conestat alfa (Ruconest®) intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The intervention group will receive conestat alfa (Ruconest®) as a 10-minute slow intravenous injection (up to 56 ml) once during the TAVI procedure followed by a second administration (up to 28 ml) again three hours later.
