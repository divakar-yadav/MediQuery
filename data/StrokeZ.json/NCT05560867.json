The costs of rehabilitation are significant and practical constraints often limit therapy to the first few months after stroke. However many studies have shown that patients in the later stages post-stroke can still continue to benefit from rehabilitation. Technology-assisted therapy may offer a means to efficiently provide ongoing therapies to patients in the later stages (\\>6 months) post-stroke. This study will determine which patients are best able to benefit from this therapy approach, and will also expand our knowledge of which brain structures need to be intact for patients to benefit from technology-assisted training. The results of this study will help to improve rehabilitation and quality of life for disabled Americans.","detailedDescription":"Study Description: This study will investigate the neural mechanisms of technology-assisted-training for post-stroke hemiparesis by using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy (fNIRS). Patients with hemiparesis affecting the arm will be brought in for 3 weeks of technology-assisted-training while having fNIRS recordings of their brain activity. Analysis of these brain activation patterns will help determine what areas of the brain are necessary to respond to this type of training.\n\nObjectives: 1) to investigate brain network activity changes that occur during technology-assisted-training and 2) to determine the baseline residual brain network connectivity required for patients to respond to robot-assisted-training.\n\nEndpoints: The study will evaluate increases in cortical connectivity between bilateral primary motor areas, angular gyrus and parietal operculum to test the hypothesis that cortical connectivity in these areas will positively correlate with improvement in technology-assisted-assessments. The study will also assess baseline connectivity of the angular gyrus and parietal operculum to sensorimotor networks to test the hypothesis that cortical connectivity in these areas will predict reductions in arm motor impairments that occur with technology-assisted-training.\n\nStudy Population: Patients of either gender with chronic (at least 6 months or more) hemiparesis of the arm caused by a single unilateral stroke will be recruited from Baltimore city and the surrounding counties."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis","Stroke Sequelae"],"keywords":["stroke","robot-assisted rehabilitation","neural networks","fnirs","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient Robot-Assisted Training Group","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients will undergo robot-assisted physical therapy three times a week, for a total of 9 sessions, while functional near-infrared spectroscopy data is collected.","interventionNames":["Device: robot-assisted training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"robot-assisted training","description":"These training platforms use gamified training tasks to improve motor control in the hemiparetic arm","armGroupLabels":["Patient Robot-Assisted Training Group"],"otherNames":["IMT InMotion Wrist Robot","IMT InMotion2 Shoulder-Elbow Robot","IMT InMotion2 Planar Robot"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in cortical connectivity measures as assessed using MRI","description":"Cortical connectivity is assessed between bilateral primary motor areas, angular gyrus and parietal operculum.
