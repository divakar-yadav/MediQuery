The study recruited stroke patients with mild cognitive impairment and dysphagia who were undergoing inpatient rehabilitation treatment in three hospitals in mainland China as the participants (study subjects). The study duration for each participant was 15 days. The subjects were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. During the treatment, all patients received routine rehabilitation treatment. In addition, patients in the control group received conventional cognitive training, while patients in the experimental group received computer-assisted cognitive training.","detailedDescription":"Computer-assisted cognitive training is a rehabilitation method that uses computer technology and psychological principles to promote the recovery of cognitive function.This is a multicenter randomized controlled study.
