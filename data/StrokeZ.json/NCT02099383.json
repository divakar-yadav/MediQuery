Part 1 assesses the rate of stroke-in-evolution 72 hours after the onset of stroke as a measure of the activity of BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy. Part 2, The investigators use two outcome measures, including Barthel index, and modified Rankin scale for neurological evaluation to assess whether BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy results in sustained clinical benefit at three months.","detailedDescription":"The investigators have recently reported a novel finding that the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio, a marker of hydration status, was an independent predictor of SIE among patients who had suffered acute ischemic stroke. The investigators found that patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 were 3.4-fold more likely to experience SIE than patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio \\< 15. The ratio of SIE was 13.9% in all patients, with 20% in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 and 8.3% in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio \\< 15. Among the patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke, 37% of them had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15.\n\nThe investigators' recent pilot study was designed to determine if providing hydration therapy, specifically intravenous saline infusion, to patients with a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) ≥15 reduces the occurrence of SIE after acute ischemic stroke. Patients in the hydration group received a significantly larger (all P \\< 0.001) median volume of infused saline than patients in the control group. And this allowed 82% of the patients to maintain their BUN/Cr ratio \\<15 in first 8 hours. The proportion of patients who experienced SIE was significantly lower in the hydration group compared with the control group.\n\nDehydration, as indicated by an increased BUN/Cr ratio, is known to be relatively common among patients who have experienced stroke. According to the result of our pilot study, a hydration strategy with intravenous 20 cc per kilogram of body weight normal saline in first 8 hours was safe and effective to prevent dehydration related early neurological deterioration.\n\nIn this study, the investigators conduct a randomized double-blind control trial to test the hypothesis that whether BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy has clinical activity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dehydration"],"keywords":["Stroke","Dehydration","Fluid Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":244,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"normal saline, bolus","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients of study group will receive intravenous normal saline 20cc per kilogram of body weight, one third of which will be given as a bolus followed by delivery of the remaining two third as a constant infusion over a period of 8 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: normal saline"]},{"label":"normal saline, control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients of control group will receive intravenous normal saline 60 cc per hour."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"normal saline","description":"intravenous normal saline 20cc per kilogram of body weight over a period of 8 hours","armGroupLabels":["normal saline, bolus"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"rate of stroke-in-evolution","description":"Stroke-in-evolution is defined as a deterioration from base line in the score on the NIHSS by 4 or more points.","timeFrame":"72 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"rate of favorable outcome","description":"Scores of \\>=60 on the Barthel index, \\<=2 on the modified Rankin scale are considered to indicate a favorable outcome.","timeFrame":"three months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
