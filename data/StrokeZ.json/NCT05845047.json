Secondary outcome measures will be: (1) changes in discourse from pre-treatment to 2 weeks post-treatment, and (2) changes in naming of objects and actions from immediately before treatment to immediately after treatment, and (3) changes in naming of objects and actions from pre-treatment to 2 months after both treatments. The investigators will also carry out resting state functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) before and after each treatment to evaluate degree and location (e.g. intrahemispheric right versus left) of changes in connectivity associated with each treatment and with changes in each outcome measure. The investigators will also take saliva samples from participants who agree to this optional part of the study to determine the participants brain-derived neurotrophic factor status."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The study is to be conducted in a blinded assessor manner.
