This study aims to validate the tool by comparing it to the gold standard assessment - Videofluoroscopy and usual assessment by a Speech and Language Therapist. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability will also be tested by comparing the assessment results of two different nurses or the same nurse.","detailedDescription":"Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) at Royal Derby Hospital (RDH) have developed a tool that trained nurses can use to carry out swallowing assessments with patients following a stroke. It consists of checks to ensure the patient is alert/well enough, checks any abnormalities in the muscles of the mouth or throat and trials different types of foods/drinks. If they 'pass' the assessment patients are started with regular diet and fluids. If they have dysphagia the nurses can recommend modified foods/drinks if they have found to be safe during the assessment. If the patients 'fail' with all trials - they remain nil by mouth. Around 50% of patients who have a stroke have difficulties swallowing (dysphagia). If dysphagia is identified early it reduces secondary complications such as pneumonia. There are no similar tools in the UK that have been tested to check they are doing what they say they are doing (validity) or the results are the same no matter which trained nurse uses the tool (reliability). This study aims to test the validity and reliability of the Dysphagia Trained Nurse Assessment DTNAx that is currently used in the acute stroke pathway at RDH.\n\nOver an 18 month period we aim to recruit 50 patients admitted to RDH with a new stroke and who have had an initial DTNAx. The results of the DTNAx will be compared to the gold standard dysphagia assessment - videofluoroscopy - a video xray of swallowing and also compared to the usual SLT assessment. We can calculate whether the tool identifies dysphagia and whether the recommendations made by using the tool are accurate and safe. To test reliability - the DTNAx will be repeated by the same nurse or by a different nurse. The patients will be involved in the study for approximately 24 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia Following Cerebral Infarction","Dysphagia Following Nontraumatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":47,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Dysphagia Trained Nurse Assessment (DTNAx)","description":"Bedside swallowing assessment carried out by trained nurses"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evidence of dysphagia on gold standard test","description":"Cut off scores as per Standardised and reliability assessment: Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile on Videofluoroscopy assessment","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Fluid Recommendation on gold standard test","description":"On Videofluoroscopy - Least restrictive fluid with Penetration Aspiration Scale of 1 or 2, MBSImP pharyngeal residue rating of \\<3, number of swallows \\< 3.","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Diet Recommendation on gold standard test","description":"On Videofluoroscopy - Least restrictive fluid with Penetration Aspiration Scale of 1 or 2, MBSImP pharyngeal residue rating of \\<3, number of swallows \\< 3. • If solid bolus trialled (forkmashable/normal) - mastication needs to be timely and complete - therefore MBS-Imp score on Component 3 Bolus preparation/mastication = 0","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Outcome of SLT clinical bedside assessment (SLTAx)","description":"This is not a standardised test - but it is usual practice.
