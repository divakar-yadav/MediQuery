Lower limb robotic devices have been shown to increase functional mobility, walking speed, step length, balance and endurance within a clinical setting. The purpose of this study is to see if a lower limb robotic device leg can be used in a community setting to improve biomechanical (gait, balance, lower-limb strength), physiological (vascular health) and performance outcomes (aerobic fitness, strength) in patients with chronic stroke"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait, Hemiplegic","Quality of Life","Vascular Stiffness","Stroke"],"keywords":["Lower-limb robotic device","Gait","Balance","Pressure","Chronic stroke","Blood pressure","Blood velocity","Aerobic fitness","Strength"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Alter G Bionic Leg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomised to a group including normal therapy (physiotherapy) and the use of a Alter G robotic bionic leg.
