Investigators will evaluate clinical practice for AF detection and treatment in stroke patients within large stroke hospital systems of care with multi-ethnic patient populations and thereby representative of the states of Florida and Puerto Rico. The results of this study will be of critical importance for secondary stroke prevention by identifying gaps in stroke care for patients with AF and by recognizing the needs for developing targeted interventions to reduce disparities in diverse populations of stroke patients with AF and improve systems of care for all stroke patients with AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Disparities","Florida-Puerto Rico Stroke Registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104308,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"In-Hospital Quality of Care Acute Stroke Measures","description":"As measured by modified rankin score (mRS) at discharge (a score that measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke).
