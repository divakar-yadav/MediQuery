Carotid stenosis is found in 1/4 of patients with atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of cerebral infarction. Additional antiplatelet therapy to standard anticoagulation therapy should be considered in some patients. To date, the best medical treatment for prevention of cerebral infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and accompanying atherosclerosis has not been evaluated yet.\n\nEdoxaban reduced bleeding complication compared to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. In addition, the ENGAGE AF TIMI-48 study showed a tendency to reduce cerebral infarction (p for interaction = 0.08) when administered in combination with one antiplatelet agent and edoxaban. The administration of antiplatelet agents may be due to patients had accompanying myocardial infarction or cerebral infarction. This group is also thought to have a high risk of bleeding due to high HAS-BLED scores. Nonetheless, there was a similar degree of bleeding in patients receiving additional antiplatelet agents. There was also less bleeding in the warfarin arm than in the use of additional antiplatelet agents. (Major bleeding: 0.19 vs 0.24% / yr; intracranial hemorrhage: 0.43 vs 0.57% / yr)\n\nThus, Edoxaban have good clinical trial results in combination with antiplatelet agents in atrial fibrillation with atherosclerosis compared to other NOACs(new oral anticoagulants). It is also considered to be suitable for combination therapy with antiplatelet agents because of its advantages in different bleeding compared to other warfarin. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Edoxaban alone or in combination with additional antiplatelet agents is better for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation and significant arteriosclerosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation","Extracranial Atherosclerosis","Intracranial Atherosclerosis","Coronary Artery Atherosclerosis","Peripheral Artery Stenosis","Anticoagulant","Antiplatelet"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"18 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Edoxaban Monotherapy","description":"edoxaban monotherapy without additional antiplatelet therapy in long term stroke prevention.\n\nHowever, transient additional antiplatelet therapy will be allowed at the discretion of duty physicians.","interventionNames":["Drug: Edoxaban Monotherapy"]},{"label":"Edoxaban and antiplatelet combination","description":"edoxaban plus additional antiplatelet therapy in long term stroke prevention.
