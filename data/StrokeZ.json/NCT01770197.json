Little is known about intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator use in the 3-4.5 hour time window among Chinese stroke patients. This exploratory study was to describe the feasibility and outcome of treatment with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the expanded time window, and to offer suggestions for future clinical work in China.","detailedDescription":"Favorable clinical outcome of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by absolute changes in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 hours and by the improvement of modified Rankin Scale score at discharge or 6-month follow-up. The safety of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by the rate of mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage and other common complications. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with favorable clinical outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["China","Stroke","Thrombolytic therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"24 Weeks","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"recombinant tissue plasminogen activator","description":"Stroke patients with rt-PA treatment in the 3-4.5 hour time window were compared with those within 3h.","interventionNames":["Drug: IV rt-PA"]},{"label":"rt-PA","description":"One group of was treated with standard recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy in 3h and the other group of stroke patients was treated within 3-4.5h.","interventionNames":["Drug: IV rt-PA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"IV rt-PA","description":"IV rt-PA treatment","armGroupLabels":["recombinant tissue plasminogen activator","rt-PA"],"otherNames":["rt-PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score and modified Rankin Scale","description":"Favorable clinical outcome of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by absolute changes in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 hours and by the improvement of modified Rankin Scale score at discharge or 6-month follow-up","timeFrame":"Outcome measure will be assessed at 24 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:stroke patients in the 3-4.5 hour time window -\n\nExclusion Criteria:stroke patients in more than 4.5 hour time window\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"stroke patients in the 3-4.5 hour time window","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Wuhan G H, High","affiliation":"Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou Command","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Outcome of Intravenous Thrombolysis for Stroke Patients in the 3-4.5 Hour Time Window","url":"http://ClinicalTrials.gov"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010959","term":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000005343","term":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"id":"D000050299","term":"Fibrin Modulating Agents"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13539","name":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","asFound":"Synchronous","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13538","name":"Plasminogen","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8163","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
