This arrhythmia is responsible for 15% of strokes and more than 30% of strokes on people over 65 years.\n\nAccording to studies, 30 to 40% of isolated atrial fibrillations could be familial. Atrial fibrillation has significant genetic heterogeneity. About 40 genes have been identified as potentially involved. Studies have identified genes common to the risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke. Despite the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation has been intensively and extensively studied for almost a century, there are still many questions. The pathophysiology is not sufficiently understood to allow finding more effective therapies. It is necessary to identify genetic determinants and thus potentially new pharmacological targets more adapted.\n\nThe establishment of a biological database will test hypotheses concerning the genetic origin and thromboembolic process of atrial fibrillation and associated stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"DNA, plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":850,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1a","description":"Patient with atrial fibrillation and without stroke history.","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood taken","Genetic: Blood taken"]},{"label":"Group 1b","description":"Patient with atrial fibrillation with scheduled electrophysiology exploration or ablation.","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood taken","Genetic: Blood taken"]},{"label":"Group 1c","description":"Patient with atrial fibrillation and with stroke history.","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood taken","Genetic: Blood taken"]},{"label":"Group 2","description":"Patients aged over 80 years old and without history of atrial fibrillation.","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood taken","Genetic: Blood taken"]},{"label":"Group 3","description":"Patient with cryptogenic stroke history before the age of 50.","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood taken","Genetic: Blood taken"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Blood taken","description":"Collection of clinical data","armGroupLabels":["Group 1a","Group 1b","Group 1c","Group 2","Group 3"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Blood taken","description":"Collection of DNA","armGroupLabels":["Group 1a","Group 1b","Group 1c","Group 2","Group 3"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Blood taken","description":"Collection of plasma","armGroupLabels":["Group 1b"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quality of DNA sample","description":"Quality is based on the measure of the purity of DNA with absorbance assay at 260/280nm on a spectrophotometer.
