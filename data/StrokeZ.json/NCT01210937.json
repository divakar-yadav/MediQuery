But during the surgery, when the carotid artery is clipping, the patient will have the chance to have hypoperfusion or stroke. Our study is designed to determine how to use TCD to reduce the risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients .","detailedDescription":"AHA guidelines recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for severe carotid stenosis. But during CEA, there is little chance that the patient suffer from severe hypoperfusion or stroke. So we use TCD to monitor the blood flow of brain in the surgery and keep the blood pressure stable. The sudy is designed to find out whether the index which we found in previous work is more sensitive to show the blood flow of middle cerebral artery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Stenosis","Carotid Artery Diseases","Stroke","Vascular Diseases"],"keywords":["Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis","Carotid Endarterectomy","Stroke","Cerebrovascular","Atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CEA and TCD monitoring","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CEA involves a neck incision and physical removal of the plaque from the inside of the artery.During the surgery, the patient will be monitored by TCD.","interventionNames":["Procedure: CEA and TCD monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"CEA and TCD monitoring","description":"All patients will receive carotid endarterectomy.
