We test a new electrods configuration : a anodale stimulation opposite to the cortical representation area of the injured hemisphere and a simultaneous stimulation opposite to the homonyme the cortical representation area of the healthy hemisphere. This approach seems to be the best relevant electrods configuration in order to restore the inter-hemispheric balance.\n\nWe hypothesis that one session of tDCS with this electrods configuration allow to improve paretic quadriceps strength in hemiparetic patients after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["tDCS","Stroke","Force","Spasticity","Gait","EMG","Isokinetic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hemiplegic patient","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"anodal transcranial direct current stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial Direct current stimulation"]},{"label":"patient control","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham transcranial direct current stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial Direct current stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial Direct current stimulation","armGroupLabels":["hemiplegic patient","patient control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"maximum voluntary isometric strength of knee extensors","description":"The maximum voluntary isometric strength of paretic knee extensors will be evaluated with a isokinetic dynamometer, which measure peak torque.","timeFrame":"2 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Resistive peak torque during passive knee flexion","timeFrame":"2h"},{"measure":"Angle related to the resistive peak torque generation of the knee extensors","timeFrame":"2h"},{"measure":"Amplitude of the interpolation twitch","timeFrame":"2h"},{"measure":"EMG activation of the knee flexors and extensors during the strength evaluations (active and passive)","timeFrame":"2h"},{"measure":"Functional evaluation of the gait performance and balance","timeFrame":"2h"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* written consent\n* hemiparetic patient after stroke in chronic phase (\\> 6 months)\n* capacity to walk with or without technical assistance\n* following rehabilitation program for lower limbs\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient with bilateral brain lesion, cerebellar syndrom, and apraxia and/or aphasia\n* previous orthopedic surgery in paretic lower limb (\\<6 moths)\n* usual tDCS contraindications\n* pregnant woman","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Roche Nicolas, MD PH","affiliation":"Raymond PoincarÃ© Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Bensmail Djamel, MD PH","affiliation":"Raymond Poincare Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Raymond Poincare Hospital","city":"Garches","zip":"92380","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.84226,"lon":2.18232}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33175411","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Elsner B, Kugler J, Pohl M, Mehrholz J.
