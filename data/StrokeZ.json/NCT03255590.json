The investigators will study chronic stroke patients , who are defined as patients that sustained a stroke at least 6 months prior to our testing date.\n\nThree functional aspects of each finger will be tested: maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), finger dexterity, and hand posture.\n\nPrior to intervention, participants will have a baseline assessment including clinical tests, MVC, the individuation task, and the configuration task. Following the baseline assessment patients will receive intervention, training on the configuration task for 5 consecutive days. On the sixth day and as a one week follow-up after, subjects will have a post-intervention assessment containing the same tests performed in baseline.\n\nThis design will allow us to determine speed and accuracy during the configuration task, the individuation index, and possible changes in abnormal flexion synergy.\n\nWe initially registered the study as two arms (anodal tDCS and sham tDCS groups) but decided to make it one arm due to the number of participants we were able to recruit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke"],"keywords":["motor recovery","motor learning","ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Finger Dexterity Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Chronic stroke patients (i.e. great than 6 months) with ischemic stroke confirmed by CT or MRI, residual unilateral upper extremity weakness, able to give informed consent, and able to understand the tasks involved.\n\nParticipants trained for 5 consecutive days, 3 to 4 h/d, on a multi-finger piano-chord-like task that cannot be performed by compensatory actions of other body parts (e.g., arm).
