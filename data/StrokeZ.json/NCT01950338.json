Different needling techniques, including the use of Botulinum Toxin A are proposed for the management of spasticity. The presence of spasticity in the lower extremity implies several impairments for standing and walking inducing high disability. No study has investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature in patients with stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a single session of deep dry needling over the musculature of the leg on spasticity, widespread pressure pain sensitivity and plantar pressures (baropodometry) in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving a single session of dry needling would exhibit a greater reduction in spasticity and pressure sensitivity than those who will not receive the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dry needling group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will receive a single session of DDN with disposable stainless steel needles (0.3mm x 50mm) that will be inserted into the skin over taut bands of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.","interventionNames":["Other: Dry needling"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group will not receive any intervention."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Dry needling","description":"Once the most painful spot is located within a palpable spastic taut band, the overlying skin is cleaned with alcohol.
