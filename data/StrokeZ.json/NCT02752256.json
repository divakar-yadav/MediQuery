Primary outcome will be the evaluation of air ambulance transfer and if it leads to protocol violations or significant delays in therapy. Protocol violations include inaccurate dosing or preparation at the outside hospital, uncontrolled blood pressure before and during the flight, unnecessary medication administration before and during the flight and adverse events (intracranial bleeding, allergic reaction) associated with transfer process. Additional evaluation will include the effects of vibration of the air ambulance and its effects on the lytic activity of rtPA. rtPA is not supposed to be significantly agitated after it is prepared in solution and there is significant vibration and agitation during air ambulance transfer."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["tissue plasminogen activator"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention/Transfer","description":"Patients who are transferred via air ambulance to a comprehensive stroke center","interventionNames":["Drug: Tissue Plasminogen Activator"]},{"label":"Control","description":"Patients presenting directly to the comprehensive stroke center","interventionNames":["Drug: Tissue Plasminogen Activator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","armGroupLabels":["Control","Intervention/Transfer"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a rtPA Protocol Violation","description":"Protocol violations can include any of the following recorded outcomes: inaccurate dosing or preparation at the outside hospital, uncontrolled blood pressure before and during the flight, unnecessary medication administration before and during the flight, intracranial bleeding, and angioedema","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Average Time to rtPA","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who received tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke\n* presented directly to comprehensive stroke center or were transferred by our air ambulance service\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Transferred by another air ambulance service or ground ambulance","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All acute ischemic stroke patients who receive rtPA and transferred to our institution via our air ambulance service or present directly to our ED","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics","city":"Iowa City","state":"Iowa","zip":"52242","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.66113,"lon":-91.53017}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"30037651","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Faine BA, Dayal S, Kumar R, Lentz SR, Leira EC.
