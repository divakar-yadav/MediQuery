Eligible patients will be randomized into either the butylphthalide (NBP) or placebo group in a 2:1 ratio.The main purpose of this study is to determine whether butylphthalide can improve dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation (dCA) in large-artery atherosclerosis acute ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Cerebral stroke, the first cause of death in China, seriously affects the health and living of people. Its high incidence, disability, mortality and recurrence rate give a heavy burden on the family, society and country. According to TOAST classification, large-artery atherosclerosis ischemic stroke is one of the most common subtypes, and majority experts demonstrate its dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation (dCA) is impaired in affected hemisphere.\n\nThrombolytic therapy with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which remains the only therapeutic drug for acute ischemic stroke approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is limited by the narrow time window of thrombolysis, bleeding complications, or high costs. Other treatment strategies mainly utilize therapeutic agents to prevent or reduce cell damage from ischemia. Butylphthalide (NBP) is a multiple target drug for the treatment of acute mild to moderate ischemic cerebral stroke.\n\nCerebral autoregulation (CA) is the main mechanism that maintains relatively constant cerebral blood flow, which is critical for the normal functioning of physiological functions, as well as the occurrence, development and prognosis of the cerebral stroke.whether NBP can improve the dCA in large-artery atherosclerosis acute ischemic stroke has not been illustrated.\n\nThus, in this study, investigators plan to enroll 99 eligible patients, which will be randomized into either the NBP or placebo group in a 2:1 ratio within 90 days follow-up to explore whether NBP can improve the dCA in large-artery atherosclerosis acute ischemic stroke. DCA measurement will be performed at 0, 14 and 90 days after entering the trial, nurses will collect intravenous blood 6ml 3 times (each time before dCA measurement, the blood samples will be stored for laboratory test). Clinical information and follow-up information will be collected and recorded in case report form (CRF) once signing of informed consent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic
