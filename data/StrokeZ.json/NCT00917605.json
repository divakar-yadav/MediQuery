In the first part of study, the investigators aim to (1) investigate the treatment effects of robot-assisted therapy (RAT) in patients with stroke on various outcomes, (2) test the dose-response relations by using two different intensities (higher versus lower intensity RAT), and (3) investigate the effects of the training intensity on a biomarker of oxidative stress. Treatment outcomes will encompass the spectrum of functioning including motor ability, motor control strategies, basic/extended daily functions, mobility, community reintegration, quality of life, and biomarker (8-OHdG). In the second part of study, the purposes are to define the appropriate populations for RAT and to examine the clinimetric properties of clinical measures relevant for use in robotic rehabilitation research. the investigators will identify the clinical predictors that will potentially influence the functional outcomes after interventions. Finally, the investigators will examine and compare the clinimetric properties (e.g., validity and responsiveness) of the clinical measures of rehabilitation outcome to inform selection of test instruments that may detect clinically meaningful change after rehabilitation therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accidents","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot-assisted therapy","description":"Patients will receive an intervention for 20 training sessions (1.5 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 consecutive weeks). The Robot-assisted arm trainer, Bi-Manu-Track (Reha-Stim Co., Berlin, Germany), will be used in this project. The Bi-Manu-Track enables the symmetrical practice of 2 movement patterns: forearm pronation-supination and wrist flexion-extension (Hesse et al., 2003; Hesse et al., 2005). Each movement has three computer-controlled modes: (1) passive-passive, with both arms being moved by the machine with speed and range of motion individually adjustable; (2) active-passive, with the nonaffected arm driving the affected arm in a mirror-like fashion; and (3) active-active, with both arms actively moving against resistance. Mode 3 is an active mode as in 2, but the paretic arm had to overcome an individually set, initially isometric resistance to allow the bilateral movement. The speed of movement, the amount of resistance, and the range of movement can be adjusted individually."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment","timeFrame":"before and after intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 3 to 24 months onset from a first-ever unilateral stroke\n2. an initial UL subsection of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score of 18 to 56 indicating moderate to severe and moderate UL movement impairment\n3. no excessive spasticity in any of the joints of the affected UL (shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers)\n4. be able to follow study instructions and perform study tasks\n5. without upper limb fracture within 3 months\n6. lack of participation in any experimental rehabilitation or drug studies during the study period\n7. willing to provide written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. subjects exhibiting physician-determined major medical problems or poor physical conditions that would interfere with participation\n2. subjects with excessive pain in any joint that might limit participation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Keh-chung Lin, ScD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-33668180","email":"kehchunglin@ntu.edu.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Keh-chung Lin, ScD","affiliation":"National Taiwan University Hospltal","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"National Taiwan University Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Keh-chung Lin, ScD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-33668180"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23587106","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wu CY, Yang CL, Chen MD, Lin KC, Wu LL.
