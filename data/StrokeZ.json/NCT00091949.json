Within 4 years of the initial TIA or ischemic stroke, 16 percent of patients will have a recurrent stroke and 9 percent will have a heart attack. Prevention of further vascular events, therefore, is critically important to the health of patients with stroke.\n\nThe IRIS trial will test a new treatment strategy based on evidence linking insulin resistance to increased risk for stroke and other vascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin, a normal human hormone, does not work effectively because the body is resistant to its effects. This condition can lead to diabetes and is thought to cause blood vessel disease, including stroke and heart attack, in patients with and without diabetes.\n\nInsulin resistance affects up to 50% of stroke patients and is effectively modified with thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. In addition to reducing insulin resistance, these drugs have other favorable effects on blood vessels, reduce blood vessel inflammation, and potentially prevent atherosclerosis. Currently marketed TZDs include rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.\n\nThe IRIS is a clinical trial that will enroll 3936 subjects at approximately 170 hospitals in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the United Kingdom (UK) and the US. After an initial screening blood test, each participant will be randomly assigned to take either pioglitazone or placebo tablets. Recruitment will be completed during 2005-2012, and all participants will be followed for a minimum of 3 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Myocardial Infarction","Diabetes"],"keywords":["stroke","heart attack","diabetes","pioglitazone","insulin resistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3876,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pioglitazone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"pioglitazone","interventionNames":["Drug: pioglitazone"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"inactive substance","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"pioglitazone","description":"a thiazolidinedione drug","armGroupLabels":["Pioglitazone"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"an inactive substance","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent Fatal or Non-fatal Stroke, or Fatal or Non-fatal Myocardial Infarction","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fatal or Non-fatal Stroke Alone","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Acute Coronary Syndrome","description":"Fatal or non-fatal acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Development of Overt Diabetes","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"All Cause Mortality","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Decline in Cognitive Status","description":"Change in modified mental status examination (3MS) score from baseline to exit.
