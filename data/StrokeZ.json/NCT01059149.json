Despite spontaneous improvement on the weeks following stroke, the importance of final disability is unpredictable. If the core of the infarct is represented by dead neurons, the neurons from adjacent areas seem to be staggered and their lack of excitability has been correlated to a bad prognosis. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) seems to be a promising technique since high frequency rTMS can increase excitability of the targeted neurons.\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate after 2 weeks of 20 min of rTMS each day: 1) the improvement of arm function and neurological and disability scales, immediately after the 2-week session, at one month, 3 months and evaluate the remnant effect at 12 months, 2) to correlate these scales to physiological parameters in order to assess the clinical modifications to the electrophysiological modifications, 3) to assert the safety of high frequency rTMS at the subacute phase of ischaemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nervous System Diseases","Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Infarction","Brain
