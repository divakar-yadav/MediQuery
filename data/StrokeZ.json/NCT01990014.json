Patients who have given their consent to be evaluated at least two years after their stroke and their operation in a single visit by clinical examination and procurement of standardized scales. Will be measured the quality of life through scale SIS3.0, residual disability by the Rankin scale. The quality of life of the carer will be assessed through scales and Zarit carer version of SIS3.0. The existence of predictive parameters of long-term evolution will be searched in determining the existence of a correlation between demographic data and baseline characteristics of the stroke on and the evolution of the quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Decompressive Craniectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"craniectomy","description":"Adult subjects who experienced a cerebral infarction extended the sylvian area, and having received treatment by decompressive craniectomy."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To assess the quality of life for long-term patients victims of malignant sylvian ischemic stroke who received decompressive craniectomy.","timeFrame":"at least two years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the quality of life in the physical and psychosocial domains","timeFrame":"at least two years"},{"measure":"To evaluate the evolution of functional disability","timeFrame":"At 3 months, 12 months and 24 months."},{"measure":"To evaluate the life satisfaction","timeFrame":"at least two years"},{"measure":"To assess the rate of recovery work","timeFrame":"at least two years"},{"measure":"To evaluate the retrospective review of patients achieving craniectomy","timeFrame":"at least two years"},{"measure":"To determine the prognostic factors that influence the level of handicap and quality of life in the long term.","timeFrame":"at least two years"},{"measure":"To evaluate the quality of life and level of long-term care accompanying persons caring for the near a victim of malignant sylvian ischemic stroke who received a decompressive craniotomy.","timeFrame":"at least two years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age\\> = 18 years\n* Having presented an ischemic stroke involving the sylvian area\n* Having received decompressive craniectomy in acute ischemic stroke\n* Time between stroke and the inclusion of at least 24 months\n* Signed informed consent\n* Patient affiliated to a social security system\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a Rankin score before stroke than or equal to 3\n* Stroke in multiple territories (contralateral carotid and / or vertebrobasilar) associated with stroke in the acute phase describing which in the opinion of the investigator significantly influence the long-term functional prognosis\n* Cognitive deterioration or severe aphasia making it impossible to fill out questionnaires\n* Minors\n* Major under curators","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult subjects who experienced a cerebral infarction extended the sylvian area, and having received treatment by decompressive craniectomy.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"SÃ‰VIN ALLOUET Mathieu, Dr","affiliation":"Nantes University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Angers","city":"Angers","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.46667,"lon":-0.55}},{"facility":"CHU de Brest","city":"Brest","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.3903,"lon":-4.48628}},{"facility":"CH R U Pontchaillou","city":"Rennes","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.11198,"lon":-1.67429}},{"facility":"CHU Bretonneau","city":"Tours","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.38333,"lon":0.68333}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
