The Predict Recovery Potential (PREP2) algorithm combines individual prediction of UL function with recommendations for treatment. The PREP2 algorithm is based on clinical assessment of UL paresis combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine corticospinal tract integrity. For this PhD project the PREP2 is modified to be applicable in a rehabilitation setting and the initial assessment of PREP2, the SAFE score, is carried out at day 14.\n\nStudy 1 Aim: Assess the accuracy of PREP2 when applied in a subacute rehabilitation setting.\n\nHypothesis: PREP2 applied at day 14 post stroke accurately predicts UL function 3 months after stroke for a minimum of 75 % of the patients.\n\nMethod: A prospective cohort study. Setting and population: The study will take place at Hammel Neurorehabilitation Centre and University Research Clinic. Ninety patients will be included.\n\nInclusion criteria: First or recurrent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (diagnosis verified by CT or MR scan); New upper limp impairment; Less than 15 days post stroke; ≥ 18 years; Able to follow simple commands and cooperate with examinations Main outcome measure: Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), measuring UL motor function.\n\nSecondary outcome measure: Fugl-Meyer Motor and sensory Assessment for UL. Functional Independence Measure (FIM).\n\nExamined at baseline: Pain wil be assessed with a verbal rating scale. Inferior subluxation in the glenohumoral joint. Neglect will be assessed with star cancellation test and line bisection test\n\nStudy 2 Prediction of real life UL use Hypothesis: PREP2 can be used to predict real life UL use 3 months post stroke. Patients: The entire cohort from study 1 will be included. Real life use will be assessed with accelerometers at 3 months follow up.\n\nMain outcome: is the use ratio between affected and unaffected UL."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Limb Hypertonia","Physical Activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":103,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"rehabilitation","description":"rehabilitation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm test","description":"Upper limb function test","timeFrame":"dec 2019"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Motor and sensory assesment","description":"Upper limb function test","timeFrame":"Dec 2019"},{"measure":"Accellerometry","description":"accellerometer","timeFrame":"dec 2019"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* First or recurrent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (diagnosis verified by CT or MR scan)\n* New upper limp impairment; Less than 15 days post stroke\n* ≥ 18 years\n* Able to follow simple commands and cooperate with examinations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subarachnoid hemorrhages\n* UL motor residuals from former stroke\n* Severe illness with life expectancy \\< 6 months\n* Place of residence more than 1½ hours drive away and not reachable for follow up assessments\n* Patients with contraindications for TMS are excluded from the TMS part of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"120 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with stroke in a rehabilitation setting","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Iris Brunner, phd","affiliation":"Iris.Brunner@rm.dk","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Camilla Lundquist","city":"Hammel","zip":"8470","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":56.25762,"lon":9.86316}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Paresis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11769","name":"Muscle Hypertonia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
