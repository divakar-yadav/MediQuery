The study has 2 arms with 1:1 randomisation to either intravenous tranexamic acid or placebo and will test the hypothesis that in patients with spontaneous ICH, treatment with tranexamic acid within 2 hours of onset will reduce haematoma expansion compared to placebo.","detailedDescription":"The trial will include patients with acute spontaneous ICH, who are ≥18 years of age and are eligible for treatment within 2 hours of stroke onset. A sample size of 326 patients is calculated to give 80% power to detect a large effect size assuming mean relative ICH haematoma growth of 38% in the placebo arm compared to 19% in the active treatment arm and standard deviation of 19%, inflated for nonparametric analysis. Adaptive increase in sample size will be performed if the result of interim analysis of the first 144 patients is promising, using the methodology of Mehta and Pocock. The maximum sample size is capped at 326. Standard CT for initial diagnosis of suspected stroke patients will be performed. Neurological impairment and functional scores will be measured by a neurologist or health care professional trained in their administration. The assessors will be blinded to the treatment group. Patients eligible for the RCT will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tranexamic acid or placebo stratified by treating centre and utilising randomly permuted blocks of random size."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Haemorrhage"],"keywords":["ICH","Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases","Tranexamic Acid","Antifibrinolytic Agents","Fibrin Modulating Agents","Pharmacologic Actions","Cardiovascular Agents","Therapeutic Uses","Hematologic Agents","Hemostatics","Contrast Media","Angiography","Cerebral Angiography","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study is a prospective phase II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-driven trial in acute intracerebral haemorrhage patients.
