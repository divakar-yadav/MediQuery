Here, the study has two aims - the primary aim is to quantify the cortical processes that contribute to gait dysfunction early post-stroke, and the second aim is to determine how cortical processes are mediated by mechanical assistance during early gait training post-stroke.\n\nParticipants will wear an electroencephalography (EEG) cap to measure brain activity and other non-invasive physiological sensors. Participants will be asked to perform different tasks, such as walking at different speeds and walking with different levels of body weight support.","detailedDescription":"This study will recruit 15 subacute post-stroke individuals and 15 age-matched neurotypical individuals between the age of 18-80 years old."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Walking, Difficulty"],"keywords":["Walking","Stroke","EEG","Assistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain activity during walking measured by EEG","description":"Changes in brain activity during walking with different levels of weight support","timeFrame":"through study study completion, an average of 2 years"},{"measure":"Brain activity during walking measured by EEG","description":"Differences in brain activity during walking between people post-stroke and neurotypical individuals","timeFrame":"through study study completion, an average of 2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria for post-stroke patients:\n\n* Participants will have a unilateral brain lesion within six months prior to participation in this project;\n* Paresis confined to one side;\n* Ability to walk for 10 meters continuously;\n* Absence of severe cognitive dysfunction as demonstrated by a Mini-Mental score greater than 24;\n* Absence of severe concurrent medical problems;\n* Ability to provide informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria for age-matched adults:\n\n* Any major neurological, cardiovascular, orthopedic, and psychiatric diagnoses","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Post-stroke participants (age 18-80), age-matched adults (age 18-80)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Chang Liu, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"352-294-1281","email":"liu.chang1@ufl.edu"},{"name":"Daniel Ferris, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"352-294-1281","email":"dferris@bme.ufl.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Chang Liu, PhD","affiliation":"University of Florida","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Daniel Ferris, PhD","affiliation":"University of Florida","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Dorian Rose, PT, PhD","affiliation":"University of Florida","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Florida","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Gainesville","state":"Florida","zip":"32610","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Chang Liu, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"352-294-1281","email":"liu.chang1@ufl.edu"},{"name":"Chang Liu, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Daniel Ferris, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":29.65163,"lon":-82.32483}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"Share deidentified data on an online repository"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000051346","term":"Mobility Limitation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M26379","name":"Mobility Limitation","asFound":"Walking, Difficulty","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
