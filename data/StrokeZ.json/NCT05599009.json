The experimental group received basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg to pressurize the upper arm of the healthy side for 5 minutes, relax for 5 minutes, and repeat 4 cycles. The control group received basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 60mmHg to pressurize the upper arm of the healthy side for 5 minutes, relax for 5 minutes, and repeat 4 cycles. The dynamic cerebral autoregulation was measured before treatment, immediately after treatment, 6 hours after treatment and 24 hours after treatment in both groups. The investigators aimed to determine the effect of remote ischemic conditioning on the dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients with intracranial and extracranial arteriosclerosis. The investigators hypothesized that remote ischemic conditioning would improve dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients with intracranial and extracranial arteriosclerosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Stenosis","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RIC+Standard medical treatment.
