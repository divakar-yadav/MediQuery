within the previous 24 hours.\n* Intent to use any endovascular thrombectomy device that is not FDA-approved.\n* Planned use of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy.\n* Known severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast preventing endovascular intervention.\n* Clinical history, past imaging, or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic or there is suspected intracranial dissection such that there is a predicted lack of success with endovascular intervention.\n* Known arterial condition that would prevent the mechanical device from achieving reperfusion (eg, aortic dissection, carotid stent).\n* Subjects with end-stage kidney disease.\n* Subjects taking a chronic anticoagulant (eg, warfarin, apixaban).\n* Known metastatic malignancy with poor prognosis.\n* Subjects with any comorbid disease, condition, or situation that would confound the neurologic and functional evaluations, prevent improvement, or render the subject unable to complete follow-up treatment, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Participation in another clinical trial of an FDA-unapproved therapeutic device or drug in the 30 days preceding study inclusion.\n* Subject has previously received scp776 in another clinical trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
