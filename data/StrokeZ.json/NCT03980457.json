All patients will receive their daily 3-hours conventional therapy, plus an hour of either exoskeleton or over-ground gait training 3 times per week for 60 minutes. Patients were assigned to either the experimental (exoskeleton) or the control (over-ground) groups by computer-generated randomization. This is an open-label pragmatic trial, where neither the patients nor the clinicians could be masked to the intervention. Institution review board (IRB) approval will be obtained for the protocol. The demographic data to be collected includes: age, gender, race/ethnicity, stroke onset to admission, stroke types (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and stroke severity (on the National Institute of Health Stroke Severity \\[NIHSS\\] scale. Admission and discharge total Functional Independence Measure (FIM), spasticity and depression scores, ambulation velocity over 2-minutes (2-MWT) in feet/minute, and discharge disposition. The intervention is Indego® exoskeleton. The primary outcome measures were: changes in the FIM, depression and spasticity scores. The secondary outcome measure was discharge disposition. Continuous variables were analyzed using Students t-test, ordinal variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney, and the nominal variables were analyzed using Chi-square analyses."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Weakness of Extremities as Sequela of Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","leg weakness","Exoskeleton"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Open label pragmatic study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exo-group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard rehabilitation plus use of Exoskeleton","interventionNames":["Device: Indego Exoskeleton","Other: Standard Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control-Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Standard Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Indego Exoskeleton","description":"Powered generated orthosis","armGroupLabels":["Exo-group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard Rehabilitation","description":"Standard Rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Control-Group","Exo-group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Functional Independence Measure (FIM™)","description":"It measure the degree of disability as well as the progress patients make throughout their medical rehabilitation programs.
