HSP is associated with poor rehabilitation outcomes, including interference with activities of daily living (ADLs) and poor quality of life (QoL). While many treatments for HSP have been proposed, most do not result in long-term relief of pain.\n\nThe investigators developed the use of intramuscular peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) for the treatment of HSP, which involves the temporary placement of a percutaneous intramuscular electrode to stimulate the axillary nerve motor points to the deltoid muscle. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) concluded that intramuscular PNS was the only treatment to provide long-term relief of pain for those with HSP. However, physical therapy (PT), which focuses on correcting biomechanics, is the most commonly prescribed treatment for HSP and is recommended by multiple practice guidelines. Prior to acceptance by the clinical community, the superiority of PNS to a course of PT must be demonstrated. The investigators completed a pilot RCT comparing PNS to PT and 67% vs. 25% of participants experienced successful pain relief (i.e., â‰¥ 2-pt or 30% reduction) from PNS and PT, respectively. Thus, the primary objective of this 2-site RCT is to confirm the findings of this preliminary pilot RCT. Combining PNS and PT, which may be how PNS is actually implemented in clinical practice, may have a synergistic therapeutic effect. Thus, the second objective of this RCT is to determine if multimodal treatment of HSP with PNS + PT is more efficacious for pain relief than PNS alone or PT alone. Mechanisms also will be explored.","detailedDescription":"Study Summary: This is a multi-site, placebo controlled, double-blinded RCT to confirm the superiority of PNS over PT in reducing HSP, and to determine if multimodal treatment of HSP with PNS + PT is more efficacious than PNS or PT alone. The standard of care for treating shoulder pain is to try several options, most commonly including medications, injections and therapy. Candidates considering this study likely have tried some treatments but without lasting success. Ninety-six participants will be randomized to receive PNS + PT, PNS + sham-PT, or sham-PNS + PT. The PNS + PT group will receive active PNS therapy for 6 hours per day for 3 weeks along with 8 sessions of PT to improve biomechanics of the affected shoulder. The PNS+ sham-PT group will receive active PNS therapy and sham-PT, consisting of placebo ultrasound, application of inert gel, lower limb strengthening, and walking exercises. The sham-PNS + PT group will receive a percutaneous lead in a similar manner as the active therapy groups, but with sham-stimulation, along with 8 sessions of PT. Measures of pain, pain interference with ADLs, QoL, shoulder biomechanics (shoulder abduction torque, shoulder kinematics, and Fugl-Meyer score), and measures of central sensitization (pain thresholds, secondary hyperalgesia, and temporal summation) will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4 (end of treatment), 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["Stroke","Shoulder Pain","Electrical stimulation","Neuromuscular stimulation","Intramuscular stimulation","Physical Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":132,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PNS + PT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The PNS+PT Group will receive peripheral nerve stimulation treatment (which will produce muscle contraction) for three weeks (6 hours daily) with an Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator following a one week electrode stabilization period, and also receive eight 60-minute sessions of outpatient physical therapy focused on shoulder pain over the same four week period.","interventionNames":["Device: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation","Other: Physical Therapy"]},{"label":"PNS + sham-PT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The PNS + sham-PT Group will receive peripheral nerve stimulation treatment (which will produce muscle contraction) for three weeks (6 hours daily) with an Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator following a one week electrode stabilization period, and also receive eight 60-minute sessions of sham outpatient physical therapy not focused on shoulder pain over the same four week period.","interventionNames":["Device: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation","Other: Sham-PT"]},{"label":"sham-PNS + PT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham-PNS + PT Group will receive sham peripheral nerve stimulation treatment (which will not produce muscle contraction) for three weeks (6 hours daily) with an Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator following a one week electrode stabilization period, and also receive eight 60-minute sessions of outpatient physical therapy focused on shoulder pain over the same four week period.","interventionNames":["Other: Physical Therapy","Device: Sham-PNS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Peripheral Nerve Stimulation","description":"The stimulation system includes an external stimulator, percutaneous lead and pad.
