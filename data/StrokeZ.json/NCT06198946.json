The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the effect of EDP treatment on trunk balance and respiratory function in stroke patients?\n* Is there a correlation between trunk balance ability and respiratory function?\n\nParticipants admitted to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group：\n\n* The control group received conventional rehabilitation therapy for 4 weeks.\n* The observation group received EDP treatment in addition to conventional rehabilitation therapy for 4 weeks.","detailedDescription":"Objective：To observe the enhancement of trunk balance ability, pulmonary function, and diaphragm function in stroke patients after treatment of external diaphragm pacing（EDP）, and analyze the potential correlation between trunk balance ability and respiratory function metrics.\n\nMethods：Thirty stroke patients admitted to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from January 2023 to August 2023 were selected. They were randomly divided into an observation group (n=15) and a control group (n=15). The control group received conventional rehabilitation therapy, while the observation group received EDP treatment in addition to conventional rehabilitation therapy for 4 weeks. Independent sample t-tests and rank-sum tests were used to compare the Modified Trunk Impairment Scale (mTIS) scores, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC change in percentage of Vital Capacity from sitting to supine position (ΔVC), diaphragmatic excursion of quiet breath(DE-QB), diaphragmatic excursion of deep breath (DE-DB), and Thickening Fraction (TF) between the two groups of patients. Pearson correlation analysis was employed to explore the correlations among these indicators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Respiratory Function"],"keywords":["External diaphragm pacing","Respiratory function","Diaphragm function","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Provide participants with routine rehabilitation treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Routine rehabilitation treatment"]},{"label":"observation group","type":"OTHER","description":"Participants received EDP treatment on the basis of conventional rehabilitation treatment","interventionNames":["Device: External diaphragm pacing（EDP）","Other: Routine rehabilitation treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"External diaphragm pacing（EDP）","description":"After the skin is disinfected, place the small electrode pads on the lower 1/3 of the outer edges of the sternocleidomastoid muscles on the left and right sides, and place the large electrodes on the surface of the pectoralis major muscles on both sides, and fix them with medical tape.
