The investigators would like to study three objectives. First, the investigators want to examine whether training with a new training device is feasible and safe during rehabilitation in the later phase, more than six months after a stroke. The investigators also evaluate whether training with a new training device has an effect on the sitting balance and the function and strength of the trunk. Finally, the investigators examine whether training with a new training device has an effect on walking, standing and activities of daily life and self-care.","detailedDescription":"The primary goal of this study is to evaluate safety, acceptance and feasibility when participants in the chronic phase after a stroke train with this newly developed trainings device. Secondly, the investigators will evaluate the effect of training with this device on secondary outcome parameters such as trunk function, standing and sitting balance, gait and selective movement. The investigators compare the effect on secondary outcomes of the experimental intervention with a control intervention using a randomized controlled trial. Both groups include participants in the chronic phase post-stroke.\n\nTRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE\n\nThe primary objective of the proposed project is to investigate the feasibility and safety of sitting balance training on the T-chair, in the chronic phase (\\>6 months) after stroke.\n\nThe second objective of the study is to investigate if utilizing the T-chair has an effect on sitting balance, trunk function and trunk strength in participants post stroke, in comparison to conventional therapy.\n\nThirdly, the investigators will examine if training on the T-chair has an effect on other parameters, such as gait, balance, activities of daily living and reintegration in community.\n\nTYPE AND DESIGN OF THE TRIAL WITH HYPOTHESIS\n\nThis study is a monocenter randomized controlled trial, evaluating participants in the chronic phase (\\>6 months) after stroke. This study will be performed in a rehabilitation center (outpatient department) in Belgium. In this study two groups will be included; the experimental group will receive usual therapy plus additional training on the T-chair, the control group will receive usual therapy only. The investigators believe this is feasible to provide only additional therapy in the experimental group, as our trial is designed to examine the effect of a specific type of additional therapy (independent sitting balance training), and not to compare the effect of one therapy over another kind of therapy.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. The T-chair is a safe and feasible training device, to train trunk function in the subacute and chronic phase after stroke.\n2. Training on the T-chair has a positive effect on trunk function and strength compared to conventional therapy.\n3. Training on the T-chair has a positive effect on balance, gait, walking endurance, walking speed, activities of daily living, level of disability and change in patient status compared to conventional therapy.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nData such as age, date of stroke, type of stroke, localization of stroke, comorbidities, dominant hand, educational level and gender are registered. Testing will be performed three times.\n\nTwo test moments at baseline, with an interval of 2 weeks. The third test moment will be conducted after the after the four weeks intervention.\n\nThe investigators evaluate feasibility and effect of sitting balance training with different standardized measures. All the outcome measures will be assessed using clinical measurement tools, whereby the investigators evaluated trunk selectivity and strength, leg selectivity and strength, walking abilities, level of functional performance and balance. Trunk strength will be assessed with a hand dynanometer and trunk stability with a balance platform BioRescue (RM Ing√©nierie, France).\n\nThe psychometric properties of the majority of the measurement tools were evaluated through a literature search. The investigators found a high interrater reliability, ranging from 0.74 to 0.99 and an excellent test-retest reliability, ranging from 0.90 to 0.99."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Chronic phase","feasibility","randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Measurements and T-chair training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive three measurements sessions and training with a new developed device (15 therapy sessions in total).","interventionNames":["Device: T-chair"]},{"label":"Measurements","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"This group will receive three measurements sessions."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"T-chair","description":"Participants will receive 15 sessions of intervention, four weeks in total with a duration of one hour for each session.
