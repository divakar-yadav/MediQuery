The Registry collects demographic, clinical and functional data of stroke patients and arises from the need to order and update this information for epidemiological and research purposes, for a better knowledge of this pathology from a rehabilitation point of view and to accelerate the development of new treatments.","detailedDescription":"The Italian Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine has published a minimal assessment protocol for stroke patients1 (PMIC2020) to share the evaluation of stroke rehabilitation needs and outcomes at any time of the rehabilitation pathway, as grounds for a National Stroke Rehabilitation Registry (SRR).\n\nThe STRATEGY multicentric study aims to verify the feasibility of implementing a PMIC2020-based SRR in a routine clinical setting, and develop data-driven prognosis prediction models.\n\nDemographic, functional and clinical variables will be collected at the admission and the discharge of the patient; in addition, two telephone follow-ups (three months and six months from the event) will be carried out\n\nThe study will involve several rehabilitation centers of the Don Gnocchi Foundation, Italy"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Registry","Outcome","Predictors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke group","description":"Patients with stroke addressing intensive inpatient rehabilitation, including and treatment, delivered according to an Individual Rehabilitation Project (IRP), defined according AHA ASA Stroke rehabilitation Guidelines (2016.

The team included internists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, speech therapists, and psychologists. The assessment protocol aimed to provide a reliable and synthetic assessment of patients' clinical conditions and function at admission and discharge. Each patient received at least three hours of specific rehabilitation per day. All patients received clinical observation and management, nurse management, physiotherapy.
