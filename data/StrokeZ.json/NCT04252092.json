Hemiplegia is a common neurological problem in the world and is the third most common cause of death.\n\nIn addition to motor loss in patients after stroke, sensory problems are accompanied and close to 60% of stroke patients experience sensory problems. In a limited number of studies in the literature, it is stated that sensory impairment in the lower extremity negatively affects standing, walking speed, balance during ambulation and symmetrical gait. At the same time, it has been proven that the sole of the foot sense plays an important role in the balance of sitting, standing up and performing independent daily living activities. After a stroke, sensory training increases functionality, patients with sensory training recover faster, mobility, balance and daily life activities become better, and daily life improvement is expressed. The purpose of sensory training is to maximize the patient's learning through the connection between environment and repetitive activities.\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the effects of neurodevelopmental physiotherapy program combined with sensory training or electrical stimulation on the sole of the foot proprioceptive and cortical senses in individuals diagnosed with hemiplegia.\n\nThere is no study on how proprioceptive and cortical sensations will be affected in acute hemiplegic patients if sensory training and electrical stimulation are added to the classical treatment program. By finding and comparing the effects of active (sensory training) and passive treatment (electric stimulation) with this study, it was planned to propose an effective treatment protocol for developing the sole of the foot senses to the experts working in this field.\n\nAs a result, purpose of the study is to prevent inadequate sensory input in hemiplegic patients from adversely affecting quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia","Stroke, Acute","Sensory Disorders"],"keywords":["Electrical stimulation","Sensory education","Sensory evaluation","Stroke","Proprioception"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 patients who will be applied 15 sessions of sensory training","interventionNames":["Other: Sensory training"]},{"label":"Electrical Stimulation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 patients who will be applied 15 sessions of electrical stimulation","interventionNames":["Other: Electrical stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sensory training","description":"15 session,20 minutes sensory training program","armGroupLabels":["Sensory Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Electrical stimulation","description":"15 session,20 minutes electrical stimulation program","armGroupLabels":["Electrical Stimulation Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment Of Joint Position Sense","description":"Joint position sense assessment will be applied to all subjects (30 patients) at the beginning and end of treatments.
