On-site, pre-hospital, clinical assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke can optimize further diagnostic and treatment pathways after patient arrival at the dedicated stroke center. A telemedical approach (interactive video and audio streaming) allows time efficient pre-hospital triage, via patient evaluation by simple, pre-defined assessment measures and a standardized questionnaire. This study is to investigate clinical efficacy of the pre-hospital triage of patients with suspected acute stroke by using advanced telecommunication tools with digital audio and video real-time streaming."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["pre-hospital triage","Stroke, suspected","Telemedicine","telemedical triage","Door-to-treatment-time"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":94,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"prehospital telemedical triage","description":"Prehospital Triage of Patients with Suspected Stroke Using Onsite Mobile Telemedicine approach (interactive video and audio streaming).

The process is supervised and evaluated by an in-hospital stroke physician in real-time. Patients considered having an acute stroke will be directly transferred to cerebral imaging via CT.
