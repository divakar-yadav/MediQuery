Specifically, the investigators will examine the effects of paired associative stimulation (PAS) which consists in delivering brief (\\< 1 ms) current pulses separated by a short millisecond-level time interval (\"asynchrony\") to two cortical areas. The used techniques are all non-invasive and considered safe in humans: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional MRI (fMRI). Based on prior literature in animals and human studies, it is hypothesized that PAS may increase or decrease effective connectivity between the stimulated areas depending on the asynchrony value. The main outcome measure is source-resolved EEG responses evoked by single-pulse TMS; this is a more direct measure of neuronal changes occurring at the targeted cortical area than motor evoked potentials (MEPs) or sensor-level EEG responses used in previous studies.","detailedDescription":"This study consists of two experiments.\n\nIn Experiment A, healthy participants without disorders or medications influencing brain function (N=24) will be recruited. A range of negative and positive asynchronies (from minus 50 to + 50 ms) will be tested. To allow comparison with prior studies that used MEPs as outcome measures, in 12 participants the primary motor cortex in the left and right hemisphere will be targeted. In another 12 participants, two cortical areas within the same hemisphere will be stimulated.\n\nIn Experiment B, participants with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or multiple sclerosis (MS) (total maximum N across all such participants is 52) will be recruited. These participants are required to have one or more subcortical white matter lesions, which would be expected to result in cortico-cortical disconnections. Here, the investigators will only test PAS with positive asynchronies, with the goal of testing if the findings observed in healthy participants are similar in participants with white matter lesions. It will also be examined if the PAS-induced connectivity changes persist beyond the stimulation sessions if PAS is given repeatedly over several days. PAS will be applied to two cortical targets that have been disconnected from each other. The rationale for including more than one disorder in Experiment B is that the disconnections are in all cases caused by white matter lesions and the results may therefore be similar. To detect possible differences between disorders, the data from the three groups will also be analyzed separately."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Multiple Sclerosis"],"keywords":["Human","Brain","Connectivity","Stroke","Traumatic brain injury","Multiple sclerosis","Transcranial magnetic stimulation","Paired associative stimulation","Electroencephalography","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"PAS will be applied to two cortical targets at different asynchronies to modulate connectivity.
