In addition to established means of facilitating motor recovery after stroke such as physical and occupational therapy, a variety of experimental rehabilitation approaches have been tested. Although there have been significant advances in stroke rehabilitation with these techniques and treatments, research on this subject is continuing. Recent studies have focused on non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) therapies, which are methods of non-invasive brain stimulation that may be effective on cerebral remodelling, aim to reestablish the disturbed balance between the anatomic areas of the brain seen in stroke patients.\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applications on the upper extremity motor functions of patients with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Motor impairment due to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is one of the leading disabilities in adults. In addition to established means of facilitating motor recovery after stroke such as physical and occupational therapy, a variety of experimental rehabilitation approaches have been tested. Recent developments include noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The use of these tools is based on neurophysiologic studies demonstrating an imbalance of interhemispheric interactions which appears to interfere with the recovery process.\n\nThe model of interhemispheric imbalance provides a framework for developing hypotheses based on its 2 facets: 1) upregulating excitability of intact portions of the ipsilesional motor cortex and 2) downregulating excitability of the contralesional motor cortex to modulate its unrestrained inhibitory influence on ipsilesional regions. Studies to date have shown have shown the beneficial effects of tDCS on motor skills and motor learning.\n\nBihemispheric tDCS may potentiate the effects of anodal stimulation to the lesional hemisphere through additional modulation of interhemispheric interactions via cathodal stimulation to the contralesional motor cortex.\n\nThe primary aim of this prospective, randomized, sham controlled study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applications on the upper extremity motor functions of patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis","Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"],"keywords":["Cortical stimulation","Motor function","Rehabilitation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the effect of tDCS plus conventional physiotherapy and occupational therapy to sham tDCS plus conventional physiotherapy and occupational therapy on upper extremity motor function in patients with subacute stroke was aimed in our study.\n\n32 patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in parallel for the duration of the study: bihemispheric tDCS (n:16), or sham tDCS (n:16).

It is designed to assess reflex activity, movement control and muscle strength in the upper extremity of people with post-stroke hemiplegia. It has been extensively used as an outcome measure in rehabilitation trials and to record poststroke recovery, particularly in the USA.\n\nThe FMUE Scale comprises 33 items, each scored on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially and 2 = performs fully. It is free, requires only household items for testing, and takes up to 30 minutes to administer.The total score ranges from 0-66 where 66.

Each item is scored from 1=complete dependence of task to 7=complete independence of task. The lowest possible attainable total score is 18 and the highest possible attainable total score is 126.

The lowest stage according to this staging system is stage 1 (flask, no movement); the highest stage is stage 6 (normal motor function).
