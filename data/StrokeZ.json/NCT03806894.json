Variation in response to clopidogrel has been reported among different population and may lead to reoccurring ischemic events. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the incidence of clopidogrel resistance in ischemic stroke patients from different ethnicities in Northern Israel and to find different strategies to overcome high platelet reactivity including clopidogrel dose adjustment or the choice of alternative agents. Quantification of platelet aggregation will be determined by vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Clopidogrel, Poor Metabolism of","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Jewish communities","description":"Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Ethiopian","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Quantification of platelet aggregation"]},{"label":"Arab populations","description":"Muslim, Christian, Druze","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Quantification of platelet aggregation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Quantification of platelet aggregation","description":"Platelet aggregation will be determined by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay","armGroupLabels":["Arab populations","Jewish communities"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rates of clopidogrel resistance assessed among the different ethnicities","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Identifying of high-risk subgroups of adverse clinical outcomes","timeFrame":"6 to 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
