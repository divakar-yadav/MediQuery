The investigators would like to study laboratory effect of the first oral 300 mg dose of aspirin, given at hospital, after an ischemic event.\n\nThe principal hypothesis is that platelet activity would be able to recover during this day and could lead to ischemic recurrences.\n\nTwo blood samples are accomplished. The first 2 hours after aspirin intake and the second 23 hours after. Photometric aggregometry are performed with arachidonic acid and collagen induced platelet aggregation, measure of thromboxan B2 levels and reticular platelets count."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["aspirin","platelet"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"Administration of 300 mg of aspirin, per os."},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"blood sample","description":"2 blood samples will be performed"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measure of platelet activity recovery within 24 hours after the first 300 mg oral dose of aspirin given at hospital at the acute phase of ischemic stroke","description":"We study laboratory parameters of the first 300 mg oral dose of aspirin given, within 48 hours, after ischemic cerebral event.
