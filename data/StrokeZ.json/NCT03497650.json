This study has been conducted as part of a PhD qualification at the Institute of Technology Sligo in Ireland with all assessments being conducted at the institute and all therapy sessions taking place at the participant's home. The study was conducted in conjunction with Sligo University Hospital and it attained ethical approval through the relevant University Hospital Ethics Committee.","detailedDescription":"The study necessitated patients with chronic stroke to perform a strength training programme with their less-affected lower limb. The mirror and strength training group observed the reflection of the training limb in a mirror, the strength training only group exercised without a mirror entirely. Patients were referred through Hospital Health Professionals. Prior to trial commencement all participants were given comprehensive trial information and provided signed written informed consent. A total of 35 participants were recruited. After a warm-up participants performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric ankle dorsiflexion contractions with their less-affected lower limb, three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received outcome assessment prior to the beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at three-month follow-up assessment. All assessments were carried out by a blinded Chartered Physiotherapist specialising in stroke rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using established outcome measures for lower limb isometric strength, motor function, muscle tone, and self-perceived participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome assessor only was masked.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror Therapy + Cross-Education.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric ankle dorsiflexions with their less-affected lower limb while observing the reflection of the exercising limb in the mirror which was placed in the patient's mid-sagittal plane.
