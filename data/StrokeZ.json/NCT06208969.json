The rapid aging of society increases the negative impact of stroke on health and limited health resources. 9-35% of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute stroke have malnutrition. However, in the first two weeks after hospitalization, malnutrition rates approximately double within two weeks of hospitalization. Although nutrition is a physiological need, it is also a social activity. Nutritional practices that meet nutritional needs during the disease process may contribute to the functional recovery of patients, the reduction of complications, and survival, as well as contributing to the quality of life of patients, independent of the disease. In terms of malnutrition risk, monitoring and treatment are recommended during the acute and discharge periods. There is a need for studies on the framework and effects of effective nutritional treatment. In order for nutrition treatment practices after discharge to achieve their goals, caregivers need to be trained effectively on this subject. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of intensive nutrition counseling to stroke patients over the age of 65 on nutritional and functional status."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Malnutrition","Old Age; Debility"],"keywords":["malnutrition","older"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intensive nutrition counseling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Five-stage nutrition counseling vith educational materials was carried out during hospitalization in the intensive nutrition counseling.
