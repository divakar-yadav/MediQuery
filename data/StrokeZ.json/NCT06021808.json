According to the previous study, the incidence of stroke were five times in patients with AF than those in the general population. Systemic oral anticoagulant is a well-established, guideline-recommended therapy for the prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF at high risk of embolism (CHA2DS2-VASc scores ≥2 in men and ≥3 in women), and the guidelines recommend that the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) be preferred (Class I, Level of evidence A). However, a significant proportion of patients with nonvalvular AF have difficulties in long-term oral anticoagulant therapy, due to medication adherence and contraindications to oral anticoagulants. Also, several randomized controlled trials indicated that bleeding risk remained high with novel oral anticoagulants. Therefore, it is essential to explore alternative treatment strategies for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF.\n\nIt has been reported that the left atrial appendage (LAA) is suspected as a vital source of cerebral emboli and may lead to ischemic stroke, removal or closure of the LAA may be an alternative to oral anticoagulants. Various surgical or interventional approaches have been developed to close or occlude LAA to prevent stroke in AF patients, such as percutaneous LAA occlusion, suture ligation, and surgical excision. However, these techniques suffer from incomplete LAA closure or the presence of residual blood flow, which can lead to thrombosis and stroke. Thoracoscopic LAA clip, on the other hand, cloud block blood flow between the LAA and the left atrium (LA), achieving isolation of LAA and preventing thrombi and strokes. A previous study has demonstrated a high 95% success rate of LAA clipping without operation-related complications, and freedom from stroke was 99.1% at a median follow-up of 20 months. Therefore, LAA clipping is an effective and durable method in stroke prevention. However, currently high-quality RCTs are lacking to support the superiority of LAA clipping compared with NOACs in terms of stroke prevention and safety. In this trial, the investigators designed a multicenter prospective RCT to compare the efficacy and safety of thoracoscopic LAA clipping and NOACs in patients with non-paroxysmal AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["left atrial appendage clipping","Stroke","Oral anticoagulation","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":290,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LAA clipping group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In this arm, participants are performed thoracoscopic LAA clipping.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Thoracoscopic LAA clipping"]},{"label":"NOACs group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomized to NOAC therapy will begin long-term oral administration of NOACs immediately after enrollment.","interventionNames":["Drug: Novel oral anticoagulant"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Thoracoscopic LAA clipping","description":"The surgeons measured the length of the base of the LAA, an appropriately sized LAA clip is then inserted with the aid of a thoracoscope and placed parallel to the base of the LAA.","armGroupLabels":["LAA clipping group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Novel oral anticoagulant","description":"For patients with creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min, oral rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was administered, whereas for patients with creatinine clearance between 30-49 ml/min, oral rivaroxaban 15 mg daily was administered.","armGroupLabels":["NOACs group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of composite endpoint","description":"Stroke, systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, major bleeding event, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding event.","timeFrame":"At 24-month after intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of stroke","description":"Acute episodes of focal or global neurological dysfunction due to cerebral, spinal cord or retinal vascular injury from haemorrhage or infarction.
