Analyzing the mechanisms of postural deficits and related problems is believed to give idea for any conceivable advance in future rehabilitation strategies in patients with stroke.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effect of scapular exercises on the scapular stability and trunk control. We hypothesized that scapular exercises correct the scapular position and improve postural control. Hence the reaching out movement can be applied in a controlled and fluent manner at the end of the treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Bobath Approach"]},{"label":"Study","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Bobath Approach","Other: Isometric scapular exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bobath Approach","description":"The patients in both groups were treated with the exercise program according to the Bobath concept was planned taking the functional needs of the survivors into account, including stretching and facilitation of latissimus dorsi muscle, facilitation of abdominal muscles, placing exercises, training of lumbar spine stabilizers, functional reach of shoulder in different directions.
