They are trying to develop a robotic environment for hands after having had a stroke. Participants will interact with up to two small robots and a visual display. The experiment involves minimal risk and may involve testing sessions over multiple weeks. Subjects must be at least 1 year post-stroke and have difficulty picking up small objects.\n\nFor more information, contact: Bambi Brewer, CMU Ph.D. Student, 412-241-9423 or bambi@andrew.cmu.edu."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Participants will interact with up to two small robots and a visual display"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* At least 1 year post-stroke\n* Difficulty picking up small objects","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yoky Matsuoka, Ph.D.","affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Roberta Klatzky, Ph.D.","affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Carnegie Mellon University","city":"Pittsburgh","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.44062,"lon":-79.99589}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
