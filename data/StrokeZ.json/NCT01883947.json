It is therefore urgent to find new rehabilitation strategies. There is some knowledge about effects of touch massage among healthy and patients with ill-health conditions but no study have evaluated touch massage in the sub-acute phase of stroke. Therefore the aim in this project is to study effects of t touch massage in the sub-acute phase after stroke in two main areas; general health and independence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Massage","General Health","Independence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Touch massage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention group will receive touch massage on hands and feet and the intervention will start one week after the onset of stroke and last for 30 minutes each time, five days a week for two weeks","interventionNames":["Procedure: Touch massage"]},{"label":"non-TENS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham treatment will start one week after the onset of stroke and last for 30 minutes each time, five days a week for two weeks","interventionNames":["Other: non-TENS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Touch massage","description":"Touch massage is a gentle massage with strokes on hands, arms, feet and legs with at pressure of 2.5 N which is more gentle than Swedish massage but harder than strokes performed with a brush.
