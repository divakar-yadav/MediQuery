It is estimated that up to 10% of patients with hypertension have the underlying, treatable condition of primary aldosteronism. Hence, we hypothesize that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is high in patients with strokes, a complication of long-standing hypertension.\n\nPatients admitted with an acute stroke to the Acute Stroke Unit, Changi General Hospital, will be screened for Primary Aldosteronism three months post-stroke, and confirmatory tests will be done with saline-infusion test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Primary Aldosteronism","Stroke"],"keywords":["Hypertension","Arrhythmia","Adrenal vein sampling","Mineralocorticoid-receptor Antagonists"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single Arm","description":"All patients admitted to the Acute Stroke Unit","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Aldosterone renin ratio"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Aldosterone renin ratio","description":"Aldosterone Renin Ratio to screen for Primary Aldosteronism","armGroupLabels":["Single Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of patients with stroke with confirmed primary aldosteronism in patients admitted to the acute stroke unit for stroke","description":"Percentage of patients with confirmed Primary Aldosteronism using confirmatory test","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of Screening test in early period post-stroke","description":"To determine if the screening blood test for primary aldosteronism performed within 1 week post-stroke is equally accurate compared to being performed 2-4 months post-stroke.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Percentage of unilateral primary aldosteronism in patients admitted with acute stroke","description":"Percentage of unilateral PA amongst patients with stroke","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Percentage of patients with positive screening test in patients admitted with acute stroke","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Blood pressure change after treatment for primary aldosteronism","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Cardiac Complications","description":"Cardiac complications in patients with primary aldosteronism, compared to those without primary aldosteronism, as assessed by transthoracic echocardiography features of left ventricular hypertrophy / mass, and diastolic dysfunction","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
