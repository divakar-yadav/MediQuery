The investigators will use WPHF NMES contractions as a model to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying muscle cramps, restless legs syndrome or stroke-induced spasticity as there is evidence that they share common underlying mechanisms. The investigators will then use WPHF NMES as a training modality to improve plantar flexor neuromuscular function in stroke patients by taking advantage of their motoneuronal hyperexcitability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cramp","Restless Legs Syndrome","Healthy Volunteers"],"keywords":["muscle strength","persistent inward current","training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Stroke patients in the training group will be compared to stroke patients in the control group.\n\nParticipants prone to cramps will be compared to healthy participants.

Sometimes the urge to move is present without the uncomfortable sensations, and sometimes the arms or other body parts are involved in addition to the legs.\n* The urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting.\n* The urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues.\n* The urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day, or only occur in the evening or night. When symptoms are severe, the worsening at night may not be noticeable but must have been previously present.\n* Symptoms are not solely accounted for by another medical or behavioral condition, such as leg cramps or habitual foot tapping.\n* No contraindication to neuromuscular electrical stimulation\n\nThey will also have to satisfy the following criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of primary RLS corresponding to:\n\n  1.
