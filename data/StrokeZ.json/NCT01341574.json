It is caused by right- as well as left-sided brain lesions, but more often by right-sided lesions. Patients with this disorder neglect the contralesional side of space and/or their body. Their body axis is often shifted ipsilesionally. A specific disorder that can appear in neglect patients is 'contraversive pushing': a postural deviation to the neglected side because the patient pushes himself away from the ipsi- to the contralesional side.\n\nOne of the most promising neglect interventions is prism adaptation (PA): inducing an optical shift of the visual field by means of prism glasses. This results in a modulation of brain areas involved in neglect and in an improvement of the neglect symptoms and postural deviation.\n\nResearch questions:\n\n1. Which period is best suited to maximize therapeutic effects? In this respect the effects of early and delayed PA will be compared, regarding neglect-, postural and cerebral measures.\n2. Which factors lead to a less favorable treatment outcome or to therapy resistance for PA?\n3. Will the impact of PA be larger if postural factors are taken into account in the prism therapy?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spatial Neglect After Stroke"],"keywords":["spatial neglect","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early phase, experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neglect patients, randomized in the experimental group (Prism adaptation, optical shift of 10 degrees) in the early phase after stroke.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Prism adaptation with optical shift of 10 degrees."]},{"label":"Delayed phase, experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neglect patients, randomized in the experimental group (Prism adaptation, optical shift of 10 degrees) in the delayed phase after stroke.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Prism adaptation with optical shift of 10 degrees."]},{"label":"Early phase, placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Neglect patients, randomized in the placebo group (Prism adaptation, optical shift of 0 degrees) in the early phase after stroke.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Prism adaptation optical shift of 0 degrees."]},{"label":"Delayed phase, placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Neglect patients, randomized in the placebo group (Prism adaptation, optical shift of 0 degrees) in the delayed phase after stroke.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Prism adaptation optical shift of 0 degrees."]},{"label":"Delayed phase postural, experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neglect patients, randomized in the experimental group (Prism adaptation, optical shift of 10 degrees) in the delayed phase after stroke.
