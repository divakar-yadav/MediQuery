MRI plays an essential role in the management of stroke. In this context, the contribution of MRI is diagnostic, etiological and prognostic.\n\nAmong the MRI parameters evaluated in the acute phase of the stroke, the evaluation of the mismatch between the DIFFUSION and FLAIR sequences is crucial as it will directly contribute to the therapeutic decision. A FLAIR-diffusion mismatch, i.e., a lesion with a diffusion but not a FLAIR hypersignal, identifies patients whose time of onset of symptoms is probably less than 4.5 hours. It is therefore understandable that the main arterial recanalization techniques performed in the acute phase are primarily reserved for patients with a positive mismatch.\n\nIn current practice, mismatch assessment is performed subjectively, by visually comparing the two sequences, which is known to be the cause of a lack of reproducibility and diagnostic performance.\n\nComputational medical imaging techniques (\"radiomics\") have recently gained momentum and offer the prospect of automated and therefore more reproducible analysis of medical imaging data. In stroke patients, radiomics extracted from FLAIR imaging could thus contribute to describe the \"diffusion flair\" mismatch in a continuous and objective way.\n\nFor the time being, data analysis cannot be performed in real time due to technical constraints. If it is proven that radiomics can reliably analyze the mismatch on the FLAIR sequence alone, the next step will be to make the analysis feasible in clinical routine (i.e. in a time frame adapted to the therapeutic management)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ability of a computational medical imaging technique (\"radiomics\"), performed on the FLAIR sequence alone, to predict the FLAIR diffusion mismatch in patients with ischemic stroke","description":"This outcome corresponds to FLAIR / Diffusion mismatch scores estimated with both techniques: automated and visual analysis.","timeFrame":"Day 1"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Inter-technique comparison of mismatch assessment between automated \"radiomics\" analysis and subjective visual analysis (currently performed in clinical routine)","description":"This outcome corresponds to the reproducibility and inter-technical agreement on the extent of the mismatch.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Evaluation of the prognostic value of the scores obtained with the two methods","description":"This outcome corresponds to the correlation of the scores obtained with the Rankin score at 3 months.","timeFrame":"Month 3"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient with age ≥ 18 years\n* Patient with supra-tentorial stroke treated by mechanical thrombectomy and who had MRI imaging on admission before endovascular treatment at Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital\n* Complete MRI protocol including Diffusion and FLAIR sequences\n* French-speaking patient\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient under guardianship or curatorship\n* Patient deprived of liberty\n* Patient under court protection\n* Patient objecting to the use of his data for this research","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients referred for suspected stroke between January 1, 2016 and May 1, 2021 at Paris Saint Joseph Hospital.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jerome HODEL, MD","affiliation":"Fondation Hôpital Saint-Joseph","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHRU Lille","city":"Lille","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":50.63297,"lon":3.05858}},{"facility":"Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph","city":"Paris","zip":"75014","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29367334","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Powers WJ, Rabinstein AA, Ackerson T, Adeoye OM, Bambakidis NC, Becker K, Biller J, Brown M, Demaerschalk BM, Hoh B, Jauch EC, Kidwell CS, Leslie-Mazwi TM, Ovbiagele B, Scott PA, Sheth KN, Southerland AM, Summers DV, Tirschwell DL; American Heart Association Stroke Council. 2018 Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.
