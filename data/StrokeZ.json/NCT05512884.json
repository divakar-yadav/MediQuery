The treatment will be delivered via a web application (QuickWord).","detailedDescription":"The main aim is to test the clinical efficacy of a novel, web based, rehabilitation approach to aphasic word-finding difficulties (QuickWord). In an initial development and case-series evaluation, Conroy et al (2018, Brain) found that training for both speed as well as accuracy of naming generated much better outcomes to picture naming accuracy and also augmented the carry-over to connected speech production.\n\nThis is a randomised, crossover, clinical trial of QuickWord in a group of aphasic patients in the chronic post-stroke period. The comparison will be standard care. The main outcome measures are clinically relevant improvement in naming to confrontation, and spontaneous use of the target vocabulary in a connected speech sample (detailed picture description). Secondary outcome includes measured use of the vocabulary in a story-telling, connected speech assessment (retelling of the Cinderella story)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"],"keywords":["Anomia","Speech Disorders","Language Disorders","Communication Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Speeded anomia therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"21h of anomia therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speeded anomia therapy"]},{"label":"Standard care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants' typical daily routine"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Speeded anomia therapy","description":"The speeded anomia therapy was introduced as RISP (Repeated, Increasingly Speeded Production) by Conroy et al.
