Stroke survivors suffer disabling chronic motor impairments that have proven challenging to improve. Increasing neuroplasticity using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is a promising approach to promote motor recovery in patients with stroke. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently widely used for treatment of depression, but they also have been shown to be able to enhance neuroplasticity. A single dose of SSRI has been shown to improve hand function in patients with chronic stroke. SSRIs also enhance neuroplasticity in healthy individuals, as shown using paired associative stimulation (PAS), a non-invasive method which causes the brain's excitability to change. However, the best dose of SSRI to increase neuroplasticity is not yet established.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to (1) find the effective dose of the SSRI escitalopram to modulate PAS-induced plasticity in patients with stroke and healthy individuals and (2) determine the variability of escitalopram's effect on PAS-induced plasticity between individuals. We measure neuroplasticity with PAS, which causes the brain's excitability to change. During PAS, you would receive electrical stimulation over your wrist and magnetic stimulation to their scalp (called transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS) to increase the excitability of the motor area of the brain. You will be asked to participate in a screening visit and 8 study visits separated by at least 1 week. At each study visit, you will be given a single dose of escitalopram (5, 10 or 20) or placebo, and we will measure your brain's change in excitability after PAS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor","Neuroplasticity","Paired Associative Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"We propose a double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study to test a range of doses of escitalopram and a placebo control in enhancing PAS-induced plasticity in healthy individuals without neurological disease and patients with chronic stroke.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Administration of SSRI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be administered either 5, 10 or 20mg of SSRI escitalopram prior to paired associative stimulation.","interventionNames":["Drug: Administration of SSRI escitalopram","Behavioral: Paired Associative stimulation"]},{"label":"Administration of Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be administered a placebo prior to paired associative stimulation","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Paired Associative stimulation","Drug: Administration of Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Administration of SSRI escitalopram","description":"Participants will be administered 5, 10 or 20mg of SRRI escitalopram prior to paired associative stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Administration of SSRI"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Paired Associative stimulation","description":"Participants will receive paired associative stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation) with an inter-stimulus interval length known to modulate corticospinal excitability.","armGroupLabels":["Administration of Placebo","Administration of SSRI"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Administration of Placebo","description":"Participants will be administered a placebo prior to paired associative stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Administration of Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in motor evoked potential amplitude","description":"Assessment of corticospinal excitability","timeFrame":"Baseline, Up to 30 minutes Post PAS"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Neurological Healthy Participants Inclusion criteria\n\n1.
