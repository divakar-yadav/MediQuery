However, little is known whether this approach is justified during the coronary artery bypass graft.Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether LAAO and Marshall ligament amputation during off-pump coronary artery bypass was associated with reduced risks of postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation and stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease","Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["off-pump coronary artery bypass","postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation","left atrial appendage","Marshall ligament"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Left Atrial Appendage Resection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: Left Atrial Appendage Resection and Marshall Ligament Amputation"]},{"label":"off-pump coronary artery bypass","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Left Atrial Appendage Resection and Marshall Ligament Amputation","description":"Left Atrial Appendage Resection and Marshall Ligament Amputation during the cardiac surgery","armGroupLabels":["Left Atrial Appendage Resection"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation","description":"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), defined as new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in the immediate period after surgery, is the most important type of secondary AF.","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke","description":"Stroke is caused by a disruption in the flow of blood to part of the brain either because of occlusion of a blood vessel in the case of acute ischemic stroke （AIS） or the rupture of a blood vessel causing bleeding in or around the brain： intracerebral hemorrhage （ICH）or subarachnoid hemorrhage （SAH）。","timeFrame":"1 months,3 months, 1years, 3years, 5years."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* isolated first off-pump coronary artery bypass\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Preoperative atrial fibrillation or a history of atrial fibrillation;\n* Concurrent cardiac or non-cardiac surgery\n* Intraoperative convert to bypass bypass surgery\n* Emergency surgery\n* History of previous cardiac surgery\n* Severe organ dysfunction","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Hengchao Wu, doctor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"010-88322355","email":"whcwuhengchao@163.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hansong Sun, doctor","affiliation":"Fuwai Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Fuwai Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beijing","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Hansong Sun, doctor","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"},{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
