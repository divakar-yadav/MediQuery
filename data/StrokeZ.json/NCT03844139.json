In this study , investigators have including and excluding criteria. Continous feeding group and intermittent feeding group had been widely used in enteral nutrition feeding in investigators' institution. Investigators will observe participants' nutrition condition and tube-feeding related complications. In continous group patients, participants usually are given prescribed enteral nutrient solution using nutrition pump in 24 hours; while in intermittent feeding group, participants will be given prescribed enteral nutrient solution in 4-5 times by special syringe. During the whole process, investigators will observe all participants' nutrition condition (body mass index, plasma albumin and calf girth) and tube-feeding related complications( regurgitation, aspiration,gastric retention, diarrhea,constipation). With all those data, the investigators will assess which feeding type is better."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Deglutition Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Feeding pump group(continous)","description":"Using the feeding pump to give patients prescribed enteral nutrient solution through nasogastric tube in 24 hours","interventionNames":["Device: Feeding pump and glycerin syringe"]},{"label":"Glycerin syringe group(intermittent)","description":"Using the glycerin syringe to give patients prescribed enteral nutrient solution through nasogastric tube in 4-5 times","interventionNames":["Device: Feeding pump and glycerin syringe"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Feeding pump and glycerin syringe","description":"The continuous group use feeding pump and the intermittent group use syringe to give dysphagia patients after stroke prescribed nutrition through nasogastric tube.","armGroupLabels":["Feeding pump group(continous)","Glycerin syringe group(intermittent)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"weight","description":"weight in kilogram every week","timeFrame":"4-6 weeks"},{"measure":"plasma albumin","description":"plasma albumin every week","timeFrame":"4-6 weeks"},{"measure":"tube-feeding related complications( regurgitation, aspiration,gastric retention, diarrhea,constipation)","description":"incidence of each complication","timeFrame":"4-6 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"calf girth","description":"length of calf girth","timeFrame":"4-6 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Older than 65 years old\n* Clinical diagnosis of stroke( ischemic and hemorrhage)\n* With moderate and/or sever swallow problem(water swallow test IV-V degree)\n* With nasogastric feeding tube more than 4 weeks\n* Do rehabilitation in our hospital or designated hospitals\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Without nasogastric feeding tube\n* Patients with fever and other infection\n* Chronic or acute anoxia\n* Poor obedience\n* Quit treatment or go back home to take rehabilitation\n* Critically ill or died","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Every 50 patients in each group","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Zhang Yuejiao, Bachelor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+8613606525359","email":"2507088@zju.edu.cn"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Zhangy Yuejiao","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hangzhou","state":"Zhejiang","zip":"310009","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Zhangy Yuejiao","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":30.29365,"lon":120.16142}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003680","term":"Deglutition Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000004935","term":"Esophageal Diseases"},{"id":"D000005767","term":"Gastrointestinal Diseases"},{"id":"D000004066","term":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"id":"D000010608","term":"Pharyngeal Diseases"},{"id":"D000010038","term":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6572","name":"Deglutition Disorders","asFound":"Deglutition Disorders","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7775","name":"Esophageal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8573","name":"Gastrointestinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6945","name":"Digestive System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13205","name":"Pharyngeal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12651","name":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC09","name":"Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000005990","term":"Glycerol"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000003451","term":"Cryoprotective Agents"},{"id":"D000020011","term":"Protective Agents"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21550","name":"Pharmaceutical Solutions","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8786","name":"Glycerol","asFound":"Irradiated","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21559","name":"Protective Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"PhSol","name":"Pharmaceutical Solutions"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
