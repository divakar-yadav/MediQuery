Finally we will investigate the effect of tACS - transcranial alternating current stimulation - as an alternative to tDCS, on motor function in healthy subjects (exp 3). The two experiments on tDCS are parallels (exp 1 \\& 2), while the experiment on tACS uses a crossover design (exp 3).\n\nFor stroke patients (Exp1), our primary outcome measure is a clinical scale (Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test), while for healthy subjects (Exp 2) we investigate the effect of tDCS and CIMIT on cortico-spinal excitability using TMS - transcranial magnetic stimulation. Finally, for the third experiment using tACS, our primary outcome is cortical oscillation, as measured by EEG - electroencephalogram."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Healthy"],"keywords":["Stroke","Transcranial direct current stimulation","Motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active tDCS + CIMT - stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 5 sessions of tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1).
