Treating hypertension has been associated with reduction in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), ramipril, showed a 32 % in relative risk of reduction in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan, also showed a 25 % in relative risk of reduction in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE).\n\nElderly people, especially hypertensive patients, with silent brain infarction have an increased risk of stroke and cognitive decline. However, no reports are seen on comparison of the effects of ARBs and ACEIs on progression of silent brain infarction and cognitive decline in patients with essential hypertension in the elderly.\n\nThe researchers therefore longitudinally evaluate silent brain infarction using magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive decline by Mini-Mental State Examination twice at an interval of 2 years in patients with essential hypertension in the elderly who are received antihypertensive therapy by ARB or ACEI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain
