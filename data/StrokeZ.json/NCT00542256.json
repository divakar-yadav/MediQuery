Research in healthy subjects has shown that when tDCS is combined with motor learning tasks, there is an increase in learning as compared to motor learning tasks only. The tDCS procedure sessions will be compared to sham (fake) procedure sessions, which is also called placebo stimulation. This study is double blind, which means neither the subjects nor researchers analyzing motor function will know if participants are receiving real tDCS stimulation or placebo. Only the person performing the procedure will know which one participants are receiving. Only by comparing the tDCS procedure to a sham (placebo) procedure can we understand if the tDCS actually improves motor function.\n\nWe hypothesize that tDCS will enhance the effects of constraint-induced movement therapy on motor recovery in chronic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Apoplexy","Cerebral Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident, Acute","Cerebrovascular Apoplexy","Cerebrovascular Stroke","CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Vascular Accident, Brain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":85,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Each subject will receive 14 days (2 week period: 10 weekdays and 2 weekends) of constraint induced movement therapy.
