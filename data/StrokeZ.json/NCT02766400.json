This loss of independence is costly because individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments require more rehabilitation and more resources to support their living, whether in institutional or community settings. The proposed study examines the effects of directed and guided training on the recovery of independence with daily activities in adults with stroke-related cognitive impairments in acute rehabilitation. The investigators predict that patients in both groups will demonstrate significant improvement in independence with daily activities in the first 12 months after rehabilitation admission, but that patients who receive guided training will demonstrate significantly more improvements than patients who received directed training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Guided Training","Directed Training"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Cognition","Disability","Intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":77,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Guided Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Guided training is a rehabilitation training approach that maximizes the expertise of the patient, by teaching patients to identify and prioritize activities, identify barriers to performing activities, generate their own strategies for addressing these barriers, and apply this process through iterative practice.
