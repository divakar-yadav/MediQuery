This often devastating condition is treated by speech and language therapists (SLTs). There is evidence that language games delivered at the right intensity are an efficacious means of improving communication for people with post stroke aphasia. However, it is unclear which mechanism of language facilitation used in a game works best. This study will provide evidence for the \"active ingredient\" of a game, together with measures of efficacy, feasibility and enjoyment compared to standard aphasia therapy.","detailedDescription":"Aphasia is a language impairment experienced by about one third of stroke patients. This often devastating condition is treated by speech and language therapists (SLTs). There is evidence that language games delivered at the right intensity are an efficacious means of improving communication for people with post stroke aphasia. However, it is unclear which mechanism of language facilitation used in a game works best. This study will provide evidence for the \"active ingredient\" of a game, together with measures of efficacy, feasibility and enjoyment compared to standard aphasia therapy.\n\nParticipants with moderate-severe difficulties will play picture naming games, involving self-cuing using gesture and circumlocution. Those with mild difficulties will play story-telling games, using similar self-cuing techniques. Change in language performance will be measured and compared to that achieved by the same participants following an episode of standard aphasia therapy from their local SLT (i.e. normal care).\n\nThis study will build on a growing evidence base for the efficacy of therapeutic language games in post stroke aphasia. In today's resource-constrained National Health Service, SLTs are continually searching for cost-effective, innovative ways of delivering therapy. Language games based on sound neuro-scientific principles have the potential to deliver improvements in functional communication by means of an enjoyable and motivating activity, and moreover can be done cost effectively. Improvements have been demonstrated from the acute through to the chronic stage of stroke. A number of factors are said to contribute to the outcomes achieved: intensity of training, behavioural relevance and focussed use of capacities. This study intends to explore in more depth some of the specific behaviours that can occur spontaneously or than can be prompted to facilitate language. The aim is to uncover the \"active ingredient\", and thereby ensure that participants can benefit maximally from therapeutic language games.\n\nThis study will contribute to the search for cost effective treatment for post-stroke aphasia, which offers ease and flexibility of delivery, is enjoyable and motivating for patients, and works."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"game therapy then standard therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"participants will take part in language game therapy followed by standard aphasia therapy","interventionNames":["Other: language game therapy","Other: standard therapy"]},{"label":"standard therapy then game therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"participants will have standard aphasia therapy first then will take part in language game therapy","interventionNames":["Other: language game therapy","Other: standard therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"language game therapy","description":"participants will take part in game therapy","armGroupLabels":["game therapy then standard therapy","standard therapy then game therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"standard therapy","description":"usual clinical care","armGroupLabels":["game therapy then standard therapy","standard therapy then game therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comprehensive Aphasia Test (Swinburn et al 2004)","description":"Measures of language performance taken as designated in the various sub-tests, and comparisons of improvement in those measures after game therapy and after standard therapy.
