Furthermore, in Sweden, as well as in several other countries, access to speech-language therapy is limited. The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare outcome from Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) provided as In-Clinic therapy (I-CT) or as synchronous telepractice therapy (TP-T).","detailedDescription":"Every year thousands of persons in Sweden suffer from brain damage resulting in anomia, that is, word finding difficulties affecting their ability to talk to other people. Anomia is one of the most common and persistent symptoms of aphasia following a left hemisphere stroke, but it is also common in in progressive neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis (MS). There is evidence that more intensive speech language therapy may improve speech even in a chronic (\\> six month post stroke) phase of aphasia. However, access to the necessary amount of speech language therapy is limited due to lack of financial resources as well as to limitations to service providers in more rural areas.\n\nIt has been suggested that telepractice may increase the access to speech-language therapy for more people but there is a lack of knowledge of whether there is a difference in outcome from interventions provided as In-Clinic therapy (I-CT) or as telepractice therapy (TP-T).\n\nVerb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) is an anomia therapy focused on the production of short phrases. The participants generate thematically related verbs and nouns to strengthen the neural connections between the action (verb) and related thematic roles (agents and patients). From orally and written stimuli, the participants are asked to tell whom (subject) may do something (verb) with what (object) and then to do short expansions from this basic phrase. So far, results from single-case experimental design studies performed by Edmonds and colleagues are promising, showing generalization of outcomes to untrained items. Moreover, improvement in word finding was observed in other tasks like object and verb naming as well as sentence production and partly to connected speech.\n\nThe present project explores the effectiveness of VNeST, first in a small pilot study, then in a clinical trial including 80 participants. Participants with left hemisphere aphasia will be randomized to either an in-clinic therapy (I-CT) group or a telepractice therapy (TP-T) group and provided VNeST following the same treatment protocol based on Edmonds (2014).\n\nOutcome measure include measures of naming ability on word- and phrase levels as well as in discourse. Measures of participant reported perceptions of functional communication and communicative participation as well as health related quality of life (PROMs) are also included."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anomia","Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The results are assessed by independent assessors blinded to in which phase (pre-post-follow up) the data is obtained, and partly to conditions for therapy (In-Clinic or Telepractice).","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telepractice treatment (TP-T)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 30 hours of training, 2-3 times a week in ten weeks using Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST).\n\nTreatment will be done with a speech-language pathologist providing the therapy through an online platform.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST)"]},{"label":"In-clinic treatment (IC-T)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive 30 hours of training, 2-3 times a week in ten weeks using Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST).\n\nTreatment will be done with a speech-language pathologist providing the therapy in person at a clinic.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST)","description":"Participants are presented with a verb (representing an activity, for example, driving) orally and in writing.

Several types of semantic clues and assistance are provided if the participant is having difficulties finding adequate nouns. This procedure is repeated for three different agents and objects related to the given verb. The participants are then asked to choose one of the three phrases participants have created and expand on it by telling where, when and why the agent is performing the activity. After this the participant are given sentences (with several foils) including the activity as well as agents and patients, and are asked to indicate whether the sentences are correct or not.","armGroupLabels":["In-clinic treatment (IC-T)","Telepractice treatment (TP-T)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in naming ability of trained items at week 10.","description":"Naming of ten trained phrases including an agent (subject), verb and a patient (object) with moving picture stimuli.
