In each of prospective medical institutions (where BOTOX is expected to be prescribed annually to at least 10 juvenile cerebral palsy patients aged 2-year or older), the Medical Representative will explain the objectives, subjects and methods of the investigation to the prospective investigator (i.e., a physician who will prescribe BOTOX and can comply with the protocol of the investigation) and ask for his/her participation in the investigation.\n2. When the physician agrees to participate in the investigation, a written agreement will be concluded between GSK and the head (e.g. director) of the medical institution prior to the start of the investigation.\n3. After the completion of the investigation period, the physician will complete the case report form (CRF) for the patients prescribed BOTOX by him/her during the investigation period. The information of the patients who developed ADRs will be collected separately through the spontaneous ADR reporting system on a daily basis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity, Post-Stroke"],"keywords":["Botox","JCP"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":326,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"JCP","description":"treatment of Equinus Foot due to Lower Limb Spasticity in Juvenile Cerebral Palsy Patients Aged 2-year or Older","interventionNames":["Drug: BOTOX"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"BOTOX","description":"BOTOX","armGroupLabels":["JCP"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"compare JCP patients with those of patients whose deaths or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to the possible spread of toxin are reported through the spontaneous ADR reporting system.","timeFrame":"2010/5/1-2010/8/31"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Background factors:\n\nThe following background characteristics will be compared between the patients collected during the investigation and the patients whose deaths or ADRs related to the possible spread of toxin are reported through the spontaneous ADR reporting system, to discuss the potential risk factors for death or spread of toxin:\n\n1. severity of indication (cerebral palsy) prior to use of BOTOX\n2.
