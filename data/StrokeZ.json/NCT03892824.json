All patients will receive bilateral implants in the common carotid arteries","detailedDescription":"The Vine™ filter (Vine™ or implant) is a permanent carotid filter designed for stroke prevention in AF patients taking OAC at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc ≤ 4 and stroke history). This patient population accounts for \\~20% of the entire AF population, which is \\~300K/year in the United State and EU. The implant is designed to exclude emboli \\> 1.4mm in size from reaching the anterior circulation. In AF patients, approximately 80% of strokes are total or partial anterior circulation strokes caused by occlusions of the main branches of the Circle of Willis, mainly M1-2, and rarely A1-2. The diameter of these branches, in the majority of cases, is \\> 1.5 mm"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["AF","Stroke","Filter","Emboli","Carotid","OAC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vine™ Filter + OAC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vine™ Filter in each common carotid artery (CCA) with oral anticoagulant treatment (either vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)) for the duration of the study","interventionNames":["Device: Vine™ Embolic Protection System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Vine™ Embolic Protection System","description":"The system includes the implant and the Vine™ Inserter (inserter) manufactured by Javelin Medical LTD (Israel).
