The primary outcomes will be the mean change in walking speed (meters per second) and mean percent change in walking speed as determined by a 10-meter Walk Test after five weeks of intervention and compared between groups.","detailedDescription":"Study participants who take part in this research study will participate in a screening visit, fifteen (15) intervention visits over approximately five weeks and a final closing visit. Study participants will be assigned by chance to one of the two study groups. Participants will not be able to switch groups once they are assigned. The investigational device includes a mobile device app and sensors that are attached to shoes. Headphones and a mobile device are also required to be used and will be provided in this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":87,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Investigational Device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Will walk for 30 minutes at a time, 3 times a week, for 5 weeks using the investigational device.","interventionNames":["Device: MR-001"]},{"label":"Active Walking Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Will walk for 30 minutes at a time, 3 times a week, for 5 weeks using only foot sensors.","interventionNames":["Other: Active Walking"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MR-001","description":"Participants will walk using the investigational device (foot sensors, mobile device with mobile app and headphones) for thirty (30) minutes at a time, 3 times a week for 5 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Investigational Device"],"otherNames":["Digital Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation Delivering Device"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Active Walking","description":"Participants will walk for thirty (30) minutes at a time, 3 times a week for 5 weeks.

It is a self-report scale containing 49 items in 12 domains and subscales which include: Energy, Upper extremity function, Work/Productivity, Mood, Self-care, Social roles, Family roles, Vision, Language, Thinking and Personality. Patients must respond to each item using the corresponding response set as indicated on 5 point scale. Higher scores indicate better functioning. The SS-QOL yields both domain scores and an overall SS-QOL summary score. The domain scores are unweighted averages of the associated items while the summary score is an unweighted average of all twelve domain scores.","timeFrame":"Baseline through study completion, an average of six weeks"},{"measure":"Change in self-perceived disability as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Version 3.0","description":"Change in self-perceived disability as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Version 3.0.

Each item is rated using a 5- point Likert scale in terms of the difficulty the patient has experienced in completing each item.
