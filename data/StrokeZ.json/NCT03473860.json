Blood samples collected from all the participants at baseline (prior to the follow-up) and the time points of follow-up were placed into ordinary test tubes and stored at 4°C for less than 4 hours. After centrifuged, plasma and erythrocyte membranes was separated and stored at -80°C. The change of total cholesterol content of erythrocyte membranes (CEM) was measured. A follow-up form was designed according to the research purpose and discussed among the team members. The follow-up was performed through telephone by the trained investigators with good communication skills and knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. Patients were followed up every six months from the day of discharge. The results of the follow-up were entered into the database, a process that was carried out by a designated person and double-checked by an independent person. The primary clinical endpoints were composite atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality. Secondary clinical endpoints were revascularization, including percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, and Class IV heart failure requiring hospitalization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease"],"keywords":["prognosis","all-cause mortality","myocardial infarction","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the change of CEM","description":"the change of CEM","timeFrame":"before and 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- month after follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"coronary revascularization","description":"coronary revascularization","timeFrame":"24- months"},{"measure":"heart failure","description":"heart failure","timeFrame":"24- months"},{"measure":"all-cause mortality","description":"all-cause mortality","timeFrame":"24- months"},{"measure":"cardiovascular mortality","description":"cardiovascular mortality","timeFrame":"24- months"},{"measure":"non-fatal myocardial infarction","description":"non-fatal myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"24- months"},{"measure":"non-fatal stroke","description":"non-fatal stroke","timeFrame":"24- months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed informed consent;\n* First diagnosis of CAD through CAG;\n* Aged 45-70.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with severe liver or kidney damage;\n* Taking statins within the last 3 months;\n* Patients who had been diagnosed with CAD and treated with oral medication;\n* Chronic diseases of the blood system;\n* Familial hyperlipidemia patients;\n* Patients combining autoimmune disease;\n* Patients combining acute infectious disease;\n* Patients who undertaken surgery or injury;\n* Patients who combining cancer;\n* Patients who taking glucocorticoid replacement therapy;\n* Abnormal red blood cell (RBC) count (M: \\<4.0 or \\>5.5 × 1012/L; F: \\<3.5 or \\>5.0 × 1012/L) or abnormal hemoglobin (M: \\<120 or \\>160 g/L; F: \\<110 or \\>150 g/L).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"First diagnosis of CAD through CAG","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
