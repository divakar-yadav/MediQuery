The specific aim of this study is to examine the difference in the treatment effects between the combination of robot assisted tenodesis-grip training with task-oriented training and combination of traditional occupational therapy with task-oriented training on the motor, sensation, hand performance of the stroke patients. The expected outcomes of this research are to help the clinicians understand the training mechanism and effects of robot assisted tenodesis-grip training on functional performance of upper extremity for unilateral stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rehabilitation, Tenodesis, Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-assisted training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will receive 20 minutes of robot assisted tenodesis-grip therapy, followed by 20 minutes of regular motor task specific training in each treatment session.","interventionNames":["Other: Motor task training"]},{"label":"Traditional occupational therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The participants will receive 20 minutes of traditional occupational therapy (sensorimotor facilitation techniques, such as: Rood, Bobath and propriocetive-neuromuscular-facilitation), followed by 20 minutes of motor task specific training in each treatment session.","interventionNames":["Other: Motor task training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor task training","description":"motor task specific training","armGroupLabels":["Robot-assisted training","Traditional occupational therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the result of Fugl-Meyer assessment for UE motor function","description":"Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed).
