In my country, 33%-50% of ischemic strokes are attributed to intracranial atherosclerosis.\n\nStudies have shown that oxidative stress, increased blood viscosity, and damage to vascular endothelial cells are important mechanisms for the development of cerebral infarction. Salvia miltiorrhiza is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine in traditional medicine in my country. Salvia miltiorrhiza polyphenolic acid is the effective ingredient of salvia miltiorrhiza. It is the water-soluble active part of salvia miltiorrhiza. It can resist oxidation, anticoagulation, antiplatelet, cell protection, and expand blood vessels, thereby achieving protection Cardiovascular system.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects and adverse effects of salvianolic acid on acute ischemic stroke onset within 72 hours, and to evaluate the improvement of patients' ischemic area perfusion and clinical function scores."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, ischemic, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"salvianolic acid group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"salvianolic acid group 100mg+0.9%NaCl 250ml, injection, 14 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Salvianolic Acid"]},{"label":"0.9% NaCl","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"0.9%NaCl 250ml, injection, 14 days","interventionNames":["Drug: 0.9% NaCl"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Salvianolic Acid","description":"salvianolic acid, injection, 100mg+0.9%NaCl 250ml, qd, 14 days","armGroupLabels":["salvianolic acid group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"0.9% NaCl","description":"0.9% NaCl","armGroupLabels":["0.9% NaCl"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MRS score","description":"MRS score ≤2","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow volume (CBV)","description":"Cerebral blood flow volume","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow (CBF)","description":"Cerebral blood flow","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"NIHSS score","description":"NIHSS score","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Adverse drug reactions (ADR)","description":"Adverse drug reactions","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
