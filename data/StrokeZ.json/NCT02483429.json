The trial will test the hypothesis that VOG-guided rapid triage (VRT) will accurately, safely, and efficiently differentiate peripheral from central vestibular disorders in ED patients presenting acute vertigo or dizziness, and that doing so has the potential to improve post-treatment clinical outcomes for these patients.","detailedDescription":"AVERT is a multicenter, Phase II clinical trial comparing a novel diagnostic strategy (VRT) to standard ED diagnostic care at three performance sites. The Specific Aims are to assess diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic workup costs, and estimate the short-term impact of correct diagnosis in anticipation of a larger, definitive Phase III trial. Adult ED patients with a chief symptom of vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness, new or clearly worse in the previous 30 days, will undergo on-site vestibular function tests by trained research personnel using a portable, quantitative VOG recording device. Research personnel will also record a focused symptom history and bedside hearing tests. Eligible patients with at least one pathologic vestibular eye movement finding or pathologic ataxia will be randomized to VRT or standard ED care. Patients eligible for pre-randomization testing but excluded from randomization will be slated for the Observational Arm of the study and will undergo limited 1 and 6 month phone follow-up. The VRT arm relies on an automated algorithm to interpret VOG results, thereby determining a patient-specific clinical care pathway. For safety, all VRT-arm study subjects will undergo stroke protocol MRI before release. All randomized subjects will undergo confirmatory testing at one week, including vestibular specialist exam and 1.5 or 3-Tesla research MRI combining stroke and internal auditory canal protocols. All randomized patients will also undergo 1 month and 6 month phone follow-up and medical record review to confirm diagnoses. Clinical findings, ED diagnoses, diagnostic resource utilization, treatments applied, and clinical events during follow-up will be recorded. A multidisciplinary, masked, expert panel will adjudicate final diagnoses."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vertigo","Dizziness"],"keywords":["Vertigo","Dizziness","Unsteadiness","Stroke","Vestibular neuritis","Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","Vestibulo-ocular reflex","Video-oculography","Emergency department"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":195,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VRT Care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to VRT (VOG-guided Rapid Triage) care will have an algorithm-determined patient-specific diagnosis and treatment pathway in the emergency department.
