This project is funded by Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality and will be carried out in 5 hospitals. Investigators will recruit 464 participants who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the research. Participants will be randomly assigned into experimental or placebo group. Granules of Shengdi Decoction is the therapeutic drug used in the experimental group. Each pack of the test drug contains 15 grams of rehmannia and 5 grams of rhubarb. While for the placebo group, each pack contains 2% rehmannia and rhubarb. Participants will receive a follow-up observation in the following 90 days. Modified Rankin Scale score (mRS), the mortality rate on day 7 and day 90 after treatment, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), expansion rate of hematoma, the degree of edema and the expressions of inflammatory indicators will be detected to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Shengdi Dahuang Decoction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute hemorrhagic stroke","Shengdi Dahuang Decoction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":464,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Shengdi Dahuang Decoction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To clarify the clinical effects of Shengdi Dahuang Decoction in the treatment of acute hemorrhagic stroke and to explore the possible mechanism.
