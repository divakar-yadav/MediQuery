Subjects enrolled in this study will be the consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in the hospital. Blood samples are taken immediately before the angiographic procedure. Clinical and angiographic characteristics are recorded. All patients will have routine follow-up at 6 months and 1 year postprocedure, then yearly thereafter. Follow-up includes mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, rehospitalization, coronary revascularization procedures, life styles, and medication use. The primary end point for the study will be the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and revascularization. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Hospital. All enrolled individuals will be received written notice of the intended use of their blood samples and provided written consent.\n\nThe major objectives of the BHAS Study are to (1) establish a prospective cohort and a biological sample bank in ethnic Chinese with coronary angiography, (2) identify baseline new biosignature profiles such as novel biomarkers via metabolomics approach associated with the subsequent clinical events, (3) assess the use of molecular profiles from multiple platforms (eg, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) integrated with readily available clinical information for improved risk classification for cardiovascular events, and (4) provide clearer understanding of underlying disease processes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atherosclerosis","Cardiovascular Diseases","Coronary Artery Disease","Myocardial Ischemia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Atherosclerosis","Longitudinal","Biomarker","Coronary angiography","Follow-up","Metabolomics","Risk factor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood, 10 mL (whole blood, plasma, serum)"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)","description":"MACE include death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and revascularization.","timeFrame":"3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with other atherosclerosis events","description":"Other atherosclerosis events include readmission for angin and transient ischemic attack.","timeFrame":"3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\>18y\n* Consent for the study\n* Primary reason for catheterization is concern for ischemic heart disease\n* Complete clinical and coronary angiogram data available\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary pulmonary hypertension or severe lung disease\n* Cardiac transplantation\n* Other solid organ transplant\n* Peripheral vascular intervention only\n* Right heart catheterization only\n* Advanced heart failure\n* Congenital heart disease\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing, or preparing for pregnant during the study period\n* Progressive fatal disease\n* History of alcoholism or drug abuse\n* Patients with mental illness and are being treated\n* Patients are undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy\n* Acute and chronic infectious diseases","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Subjects enrolled in this study will be the consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography at the Beijing Hospital in Beijing, China.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ruiyue Yang, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+861058115049","email":"yangruiyue4057@bjhmoh.cn"},{"name":"Wenduo Zhang, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+861085136232","email":"zhangwenduo3103@bjhmoh.cn"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Fusui Ji, M.D.","affiliation":"Department of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital,National Center of Gerontology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Wenxiang Chen, M.D.","affiliation":"The MOH Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Xue Yu, M.D.","affiliation":"Department of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital,National Center of Gerontology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Bejing Hosptial","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100730","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Ruiyue Yang, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+861058115049","email":"yangruiyue4057@bjhmoh.cn"},{"name":"Wenduo Zhang, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+861085136232","email":"zhangwenduo3103@bjhmoh.cn"},{"name":"Fusui Ji, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Wenxiang Chen, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Jun Dong, Ph.D","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Xue Yu, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Ruiyue Yang, M.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Wenduo Zhang, M.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Siming Wang, Ph.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Xinyue Wang, M.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18279733","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Kip KE, Hollabaugh K, Marroquin OC, Williams DO.
