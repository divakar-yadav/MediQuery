The basic hypothesis of the study is that the degree of aortic calcification is an important component of elevated central BP, which, in turn, is important for the organ-damage and increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with CKD.\n\nMethods:\n\nAdult patients with varying degrees of CKD undergoing scheduled coronary angiography (CAG) at Aarhus University Hospital will be included in this study.\n\nDuring the CAG procedure, systolic and diastolic BP is determined in the ascending part of aorta by a calibrated pressure transducer connected to the fluid-filled CAG catheter.\n\nSimultaneous with the registration of invasive aortic BP, estimation of central BP is performed using radial artery tonometry (SphygmoCor®), while a corresponding brachial BP is also measured.\n\nPrior to the CAG, a non-contrast CT scan of aorta in its entirety will be performed to enable blinded quantification of calcification in the wall of aorta and coronary arteries.\n\nFurthermore, echocardiography, resting BP measurement and a range of blood- and urine samples will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Arterial Calcification","Kidney Diseases","Coronary Artery Disease","Aortic Calcification","Stroke","Vascular Diseases","Vascular Calcification"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Whole Blood, Plasma, Urine"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":185,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non-CKD (eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2)","description":"Patients with renal function considered normal for age (eGFR \\>60 ml/min/1.73 m2) without proteinuria or structural kidney disease."},{"label":"CKD stage 3a (eGFR 45-59 ml/min/1,73 m2)","description":"Patients with CKD stage 3a (eGFR 45-59 ml/min/1,73 m2)"},{"label":"CKD stage 3b (eGFR 30-44 ml/min/1,73 m2)","description":"Patients with CKD stage 3b (eGFR 30-44 ml/min/1,73 m2)"},{"label":"CKD stage 4 (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1,73 m2)","description":"Patients with CKD stage 4 (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1,73 m2)"},{"label":"CKD stage 5 (eGFR <15 ml/min/1,73 m2)","description":"Patients with CKD stage 5 (eGFR \\<15 ml/min/1,73 m2). 50% of these patients will be in dialysis, while the other 50% will be pre-dialysis patients."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The difference between directly measured and estimated aortic (central) systolic blood pressure and the corresponding brachial systolic blood pressure","description":"Systolic arterial pressure will be determined in the ascending part of aorta using a calibrated pressure transducer connected to the CAG catheter.
