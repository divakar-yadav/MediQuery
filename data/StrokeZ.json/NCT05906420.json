The main question it aims to answer is the modified Rankin score in 3 months after the event.\n\nParticipants will be patients with acute ischemic stroke of the posterior circulation with mRS priot to event \\<3. All the data will be collected retrospectively from patients included in the ASTRAL registry between January 2003 and December 2021. The ASTRAL registry will be used as the derivation cohort of the score. Demographics, acute glucose, NIHSS score and acute imaging of each participant will be used from the derivation cohort in order to create an integer-based prognostic score. After internal validation, we plan to validate the score in external stroke registries to show its validity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Ischemic","Stroke Acute","Posterior Circulation Brain Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ASTRAL","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: ASTRAL prognostic score"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"ASTRAL prognostic score","description":"ASTRAL prognostic score","armGroupLabels":["ASTRAL"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"3 months modified Ranking scale","description":"evaluation of 3 months neurological disability","timeFrame":"January 2003-December 2021"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Isolated posterior circulation strokes based on clinical or/and imaging evidence.\n* Arriving within 24h at hospital since last proof of good health.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* no available data for 3 months modified Rankin Score\n* modified Rankin Scoreâ‰¥3 prior the event","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The participants included in this study are exclusively patients with acute ischemic stroke of the posterior circulation arriving at the hospital within 24h since last proof of good health.
