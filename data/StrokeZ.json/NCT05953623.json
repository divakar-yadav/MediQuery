Despite being utilized as a neuroprotective agent for stroke patients, albumin has not demonstrated efficacy, partly due to the persistence of the occluded vessel responsible for the stroke, thereby hindering the albumin's ability to exert its therapeutic effects in the ischemic region. In light of the advent of thrombectomy and subsequent recanalization of occluded blood vessels, it is imperative to reassess the potential impact of albumin. In this study, we plan to conduct a 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial to determine the safety and feasibility of intra-arterial albumin infusion for stroke patients undergoing successful mechanical thrombectomy. Since this is a 3 + 3 dose-escalation study with 5 doses (0.25g/kg, 0.35g/kg, 0.40g/kg, 0.45g/kg, 0.5g/kg), a minimum of 15 (5 groups × 3 patient/group) patients will be required, assuming no major response occurs at any dose level, and a maximum of 30 (5 groups × 6 patient/group) patients will be required, assuming one major response occurs at each dose level. The present study is expected to provide the basis for subsequent phase 2 randomized control trials to explore the efficacy of intra-arterial albumin infusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic","Albumin","Endovascular Procedures","Large Vessel Occlusion"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Albumin","Endovascular Therapy","Large Vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intra-arterial albumin infusion","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Biological: Albumin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Albumin","description":"This is a 3 + 3 dose-escalation study with 5 doses (0.25g/kg, 0.35g/kg, 0.40g/kg, 0.45g/kg, 0.5g/kg).
