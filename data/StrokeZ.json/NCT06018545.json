The study aims to evaluate the changes in accuracy, review time, and diagnostic confidence when using the AI tool. It also seeks to provide evidence on the diagnostic performance of the AI tool and its potential to improve efficiency and patient care in the context of the National Health Service (NHS). The study will use a dataset of 150 CT head scans, including both control cases and abnormal cases with specific abnormalities. The results of this study will inform larger follow-up studies in real-life Emergency Department (ED) settings."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Hemorrhages","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Hydrocephalus","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebral Edema","Cerebral Injury"],"keywords":["Radiology","Head tomography","Emergency medicine","Radiographer","Artificial intelligence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Readers","description":"30 readers will be recruited across four NHS trusts including ten general radiologists, fifteen emergency medicine clinicians, and five CT radiographers of varying seniority.
