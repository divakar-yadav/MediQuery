It will also compare the experiences of participants who receive problem-solving therapy to those who receive stroke-related health education.\n\nMany stroke survivors and caregivers report feeling sad or blue at some point after the stroke. These feelings can impact quality of life. Encountering problems is a part of daily life. These problems can be big or small, but sometimes they can pile up and feel overwhelming, contributing to feelings of sadness. Problem-solving therapy is a tool that teaches structured ways to address current problems or challenges in your life.\n\nParticipants who are assigned to receive problem-solving therapy will work with a research team member for six, one-hour sessions. During each session, participants will identify a problem (big or small) and create a plan to work on that problem.\n\nParticipants who are assigned to receive stroke-related health education will work with a research team member who will teach them about various topics related to stroke over six, one-hour sessions. Each session will cover information about a different topic related to stroke.\n\nOutcomes data will be collected at approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 13 weeks from baseline."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Quality of Life","Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Problem-Solving Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants who are assigned to receive problem-solving therapy will work with a research team member for six, one-hour sessions.
