Stroke in Taiwan has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but also in countries around the world), stroke and the impact of socio-economic and health spending are large how to reduce the degree of disability after stroke is an important issue in medicine. For a long time, the resident will fill the clinical pathway form before the stroke inpatients were discharged. We also analyzed the data of clinical pathway every three months.\n\nAccording to the current data of stroke clinical pathway included demographic data, length of hospitalization days, complications, functional independent measure, Brunnstrom motor recovery stage, mini-mental state examination, geriatric depression scale, blood pressure data, and post-stroke checklist for a retrospective analysis to provide more complete and more comprehensive information on follow-up care for stroke patients and effective use of medical resources, to improve the quality of future medical care and quality of life for stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, clinical pathway, medical care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"functional independent measurement","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"post-stroke checklist","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Brunnstrom motor recovery stage","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
