Favorable outcome is strongly associated with the successful reperfusion status. New device of MT such as contact aspiration seems promising to increase reperfusion status and clinical outcome.\n\nThe main hypothesis is to show the superiority of combining the use of contact aspiration with a stent retriever compared to a stent retriever alone in treatment of acute stroke due to proximal arterial occlusion.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the rate of perfect reperfusion score at the end of the endovascular procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":408,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Combined use of contact aspiration and stent retriever","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combined use of contact aspiration and stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy for recanalization","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Combined contact aspiration/Stent Retriever Technique"]},{"label":"Stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy alone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy alone for recanalisation","interventionNames":["Device: Stent retriever technique"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Combined contact aspiration/Stent Retriever Technique","description":"Combined contact aspiration/SR is performed using a balloon-guide catheter (BGC). A 0.021 to 0.027 inch inner lumen microcatheter with a 0.014 to 0.016 inch micro-wire inside is introduced into a large-bore aspiration catheter and this construct is introduced into BGC. The BGC is placed into the origin of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA). The catheter is advanced past the thrombus over the micro-wire to allow the SR deployment. The SR is deployed across the occlusion. Then the large bore distal access catheter is advanced to contact the proximal edge of the SR. The aspiration pump is connected to the large bore distal access catheter. After at least 90 sec, the SR and the large bore distal access catheter are pulled out as an unit from the BGC and the patient. Manual aspiration is also be applied to the BGC during the pull-out manoeuver which is performed after the temporary inflation of the balloon at the tip of the BGC to ensure flow arrest into the carotid","armGroupLabels":["Combined use of contact aspiration and stent retriever"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Stent retriever technique","description":"The technique used should be in accordance with the device instruction for use.
