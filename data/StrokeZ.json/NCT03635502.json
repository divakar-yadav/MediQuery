After stroke, motor imagery ability is impaired and also due to structure of MI, not every stroke patients is able to perform MI. Therefore, the aim of the study is a) to compare both explicit and implicit motor imagery ability (MIA) between patients with stroke and healthy subjects, b) to examine predictive effects of clinical characteristics for MIA after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Healthy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":77,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Group"},{"label":"Healthy Group"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3)","description":"MIQ-3 evaluates an individual's motor imagery ability in 3 subscales: 1. internal imagery, 2. external imagery, 3. kinesthetic imagery. Each of these scales ranges from 1 to 7 where 1 indicates very hard to see/feel (image) and 7 indicates very easy to see/feel. 12 items are included in the MIQ-3 and every item is scored according to the scales. The higher the score in subscales, the better the results are.","timeFrame":"15 min"},{"measure":"Chaotic Motor Imagery Assessment- Hand Rotation","description":"Hand Rotation is the first component of Chaotic Motor Imagery Assessment. In this measure, 96 drawings of each hand (left and right) from 4 different plane and at 12 different angle are presented to the individuals and then, it is asked to decide whether it is left or right hand. Total test time, total accuracy, total wrong answers, right accuracy, left accuracy, impaired hand and non-impaired hand accuracy is recorded as outcome scores.","timeFrame":"20 min"},{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"Box and Block Test is used to calculate mental chronometry (MC) ratio. During the test, patients are asked to carry 15 blocks first physically and then mentally from one box to another. As outcome scores, the time required to carry 15 blocks physically (MET) and mentally (MIT) are recorded. Then MC ratio is calculated with the formula: (MET-MIT)/ MET.","timeFrame":"5 min"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment- Upper Extremity","description":"Upper extremity part of Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMAUE) is used to evaluate patients' motor impairment level. Total motor and sensory scores are recorded. Then, patients are divided into 4 different categories according to their motor impairment level:\n\n1. 23-31 points: poor upper extremity function,\n2. 32-47 points: limited function,\n3. 48-52 points: notable function, 4.53-66 points: full function.","timeFrame":"10 min"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Activity Log-28","description":"Turkish version of MAL-28 was used to assess how much (amount of use scale) and how well (how well scale) the patients used their upper extremity in daily life after stroke.
