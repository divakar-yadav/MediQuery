The 'stepped-wedge ' cluster randomised trial is a form of cross-over design with unidirectional cross-over ( from control to experimental ) but with randomisation of when each cluster undertakes this transition. In the stepped-wedge design, there is a staggered roll-out of the intervention, where the time and hence the sequence of units (clusters) that will start the intervention at each period is determined by random allocation.\n\nThe randomisation occurs before the start of the trial. All clusters start the trial in a control phase with no intervention being delivered at any site, then sequentially cross over from the control group to the intervention group, until all sites are receiving the intervention. Outcomes are measured on the study participants in all clusters at every time period, hence measurement of outcomes takes place at each step in the wedge; each cluster provides data points in the control and intervention conditions allowing each site to act as its own control."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["education","physiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":320,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group5","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group7","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]},{"label":"Group8","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Multimodal intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Multimodal intervention","description":"Educational advice + physiotherapist treatment","armGroupLabels":["Group1","Group2","Group3","Group4","Group5","Group6","Group7","Group8"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS):","description":"Measures neurological status of stroke (psychometric properties: Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.924 (95% CI: 0.896-0.951) and internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha of 0.792, N=155","timeFrame":"8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Trunk Control Test (TCT):","description":"scores trunk control (psychometric properties: inter-rater reliability by Spearman's correlation coefficient r=0.76; internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha 0.83-0.86).","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Motricity index (MI) of the lower and upper limbs","description":"measures upper and lower limb strength (Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.87 (p\\<0.001) for MI-LL, and of 0.88 (p\\<0.001) for MI-UL).","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Barthel Index (BI)","description":"scores the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) (inter-observer reliability by Kappa indices 0.47-1.00; intra-observer reliability by Kappa indices 0.84-0.972; internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha 0.86-0.92).","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16):","description":"measures the deficits and physical limitations provoked by stroke (ADL, mobility and hand function) (internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha 0.87-0.95).","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (MRS)","description":"to score the incapacity of the patient (inter-observer reliability by Kappa indices (k=0.56 to k=0.78).
