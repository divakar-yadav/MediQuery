The adjunction of small wheel below the 4 point of the canne (4-roll) gives the possibility to the patient to walk without having to lift the canne as it will roll over the ground.\n\nOBJECTIVE To compare the gait parameters with a 4-point canne and with a 4-roll canne METHODS The investigators will recruited stroke patients who necessitate 4 point-canne as walking aids. A 10 meters walking test, a 6 minutes walking test, an estimated energy cost and a patient's satisfaction will be monitored with a 4-point canne (day 1) and with a 4-roll canne (day 2) in a cross-over study. The first tested device will be randomized.\n\nPERSPECTIVE The investigators hope to demonstrate that a 4-roll canne makes possible to walk faster in a safe way after stroke"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","walking","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"4-point canne","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Stroke patients walk with 4-point canne","interventionNames":["Device: 4-roll canne"]},{"label":"4-roll canne","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke patients walk with 4-roll canne","interventionNames":["Device: 4-roll canne"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"4-roll canne","armGroupLabels":["4-point canne","4-roll canne"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meters walking test at spontaneous speed","timeFrame":"2 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meters walking test at fast speed","timeFrame":"2 days"},{"measure":"6 minutes walking test","timeFrame":"2 days"},{"measure":"Borg scale for perceived exertion","timeFrame":"2 days"},{"measure":"Visual analogic scale for personal satisfaction","timeFrame":"2 days"},{"measure":"Energy cost","description":"Extrapolated from heart rate while walking","timeFrame":"2 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* post stroke patient\n* able to walk 10 meters\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* cognitive impairment limiting walking capacities\n* need support when walking","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thierry Deltombe, MD","affiliation":"CHU Dinant Godinne / UcL Namur","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Geoffroy Dellicour, PT","affiliation":"Centre Neurologique William Lennox Ottignies","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Deltombe Thierry","city":"Yvoir","zip":"5530","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.3279,"lon":4.88059}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4202","name":"Oculocerebral Syndrome With Hypopigmentation","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
