The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BTX) injections into the elbow flexors on the reduction of spastic co-contractions (spastic co-contraction index, SCCI) during an active elbow extension in chronic post-stroke patients.TBA injections are performed as part of routine care","detailedDescription":"BTX is a valuable treatment in the management of the focal muscle overactivity (spasticity) following acquired brain injury. If BTX injections reduce spasticity, few studies have examined its effect on the improvement of active function of the upper limb.\n\nMotor task involves the muscles agonists and antagonists by phenomena of muscular coactivation.\n\nIn post-stroke patients, functional cortical reorganization secondary to the phenomena of plasticity leads to a reduced motor selectivity. The increase of muscular coactivation correspond to the spastic cocontraction, which are a little evaluated in clinical practice and research, whereas they appear to have a greater impact than spasticity on limitation of active movement.\n\nThis study does not evaluate the efficacy of treatment (BTX injection) but the effect of this treatment on a component of muscle hyperactivity, the spastic cocontraction.\n\nIn addition to the 5 follow-up visits, patients have 6 intercurrent visits. These visits are less invasive and include only a clinical assessment with surface EMG registration. These evaluations will evaluate the efficacy and harm effect of BTX on clinical parameters and on the spastic co-contraction index. Five intercurrent visits I1, I2, I3, I4, I5 are perform respectively 2 weeks after T1 and, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks after T2."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Muscle Spasticity","Upper Extremity Paralysis"],"keywords":["Botulinum toxin","Cerebrovascular Accident","upper-limb movement","spastic cocontraction","electromyography","electroencephalography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"2 groups, one with 40 stroke patients and the control group with 40 healthy subjects prospective, longitudinal, without blinding, multicenter.","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"40 stroke patients : Injection of the TBA and the investigator will compare the measure of spastic cocontraction index (ICCS) during different movement before versus 4 weeks after injection of TBA : Clinical evaluation and Instrumental evaluation TBA injections are performed as part of routine care","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical evaluation and Instrumental evaluation"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group : Clinical evaluation consists in the search for criteria of non-inclusion and manual laterality score The will ha an Instrumental review just like the patient : concomitant evaluation of the 3D kinematics of the dominant upper limb, EMG of the triceps brachii muscles, biceps brachii, brachio-radial, brachial; associated with EEG recording, during active extension and elbow flexion movements, of the dominant upper extremity, at spontaneous and maximal speed Clinical evaluation","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical evaluation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical evaluation","description":"For the control group : only one clinical evaluation : search for non-inclusion criteria and manual laterality score","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical evaluation and Instrumental evaluation","description":"For the patient : The standard clinical examination to evaluate movement : pain, motive power, spasticity plus Edinburgh's laterality score and Sensitivity deficiency by the Erasmus Nottingham Sensory Assessment (EmNSA) score and the evaluation of the cognitive function An encephalic MRI An instrumental evaluation : with concomitant recording of 3D kinematic data, surface and intramuscular EMG of the flexor and elbow extensor muscles, and EEG during active elbow extension, paretic and non-paretic movements.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of the spastic co-contraction index from the EMG signal","description":"Measurement of the spastic co-contraction index (SCCI) during a maximal active elbow extension, obtained from the EMG signal of the elbow muscles on the paretic side before / after BTX injection.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Spasticity of the elbow flexors","description":"Spasticity of the elbow flexors according to Tardieu scale at different time : Spasticity is muscle resistance during fast-moving passive stretching.
