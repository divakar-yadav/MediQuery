UCB therapy has a neuroprotective effect through anti-inflammatory effect and anti-apoptosis.\n\nHowever, UCB alone has not been able to provide sufficient improvement and is being studied for combination therapies with growth factors that can exert its effects. Among the various growth factors, EPO is a powerful factor that can act as a neurotrophic factor in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and neural stem/precursor cells.\n\nIn our previous study of subacute stroke animal models, investigators confirmed that the combined administration of UCB and EPO improved the behavioral assessment (mNSS, Cylinder test) compared to UCB only administration.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the difference in therapeutic effects between UCB alone therapy and UCB and EPO combination therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Umbilical Cord Blood","Erythropoietin","Safety","Treatment Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Group 1: UCB infusion and EPO injection group Group 2: UCB infusion and placebo EPO injection group Group 3: Placebo UCB infusion and placebo EPO injection group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"UCB infusion and EPO injection group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Take immunosuppressant agents for 1 week.
