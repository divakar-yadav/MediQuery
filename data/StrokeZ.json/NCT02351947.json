The methods for evaluation of brain changes will consist of the combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).","detailedDescription":"A third of American Veterans is left with moderate to severe motor deficits after stroke. Intensive rehabilitation can resolve some of these deficits. Motor function restoration is associated with and dependent on reorganization of neuronal networks (i.e. plasticity). However, our understanding of human brain plasticity during functional recovery is incomplete. Furthermore, it is unknown what patterns of structural brain changes are associated with greater gains in motor function as a result of motor learning therapy. The main objective of the study is to characterize the reorganization of brain structure and function that is associated with greater gains in motor function following restorative rehabilitation for chronic survivors. This will further our understanding of recovery after brain injury and subsequently assist in more accurately directing rehabilitation therapies to produce the best possible outcomes.\n\nThe two hypotheses are: I. There is reorganization of both movement control brain regions and pathways between regions that is associated with functional motor recovery in response to intensive motor learning after stroke; and II. For stroke victims with upper extremity deficits, motor recovery is associated with changes in the sequential timing of activity across cortical regions.\n\nDesign and Methods. A cohort of chronic stroke survivors with upper extremity deficits will be treated by our intensive multimodal 12-week motor learning program. Brain imaging (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)) and neurophysiological (Electroencephalogram (EEG)) studies as well as functional motor tests (Arm Motor Activity test and Fugl-Meyer Coordination test) will be obtained before and after the treatment. Age-matched control subjects will be evaluated as well. DTI/fMRI and EEG/fMRI combination techniques will be used to determine changes in brain structure and function as a result of the treatments. A regression analysis will determine which brain structure parameters can predictor greater motor function gains."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["stroke","Cerebrovascular accident","rehabilitation","motor learning","fMRI","plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"persons with chronic stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"upper limb rehabilitation for chronic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: upper limb rehabilitation for chronic stroke"]},{"label":"Healthy, age matched control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Healthy aged match control group undergoing MRI/EEG testing"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"upper limb rehabilitation for chronic stroke","description":"subjects in this group will receive upper limb motor learning rehabilitation and undergo fMRI/EEG testing as well as testing of motor function (AMAT and FM).","armGroupLabels":["persons with chronic stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"functional MRI during movement of the shoulder and elbow","description":"MRI allows for observation of the internal structures of the body using a magnetic field and radiowaves.
