Using a prospective randomized controlled study, 72 patients with pulmonary infection after stroke admitted to our hospital from May 2020 to May 2021 were randomly divided into the intervention group and control group, with 36 patients in each group. Both groups were treated with conventional drug therapy, rehabilitation therapy and breathing training for 2 consecutive weeks. On this basis, the intervention group additionally received acupuncture therapy. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score and clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) before and after treatment, time of fever relieving, time for the disappearance of cough, expectoration and moist rales in the lung, white blood cell count (WBC), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, calcitonin (PCT) level and pulmonary indexes were compared between the 2 groups, respectively, to evaluate clinical efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Lung Diseases"],"keywords":["Acupuncture therapy","Respiratory training","Seroinflammatory factors","Lung function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"the intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TCM acupuncture therapy Conventional drug therapy Rehabilitation therapy Breathing training","interventionNames":["Device: TCM acupuncture therapy","Drug: Conventional drug therapy","Behavioral: Rehabilitation therapy","Behavioral: Breathing training"]},{"label":"the control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional drug therapy Rehabilitation therapy Breathing training","interventionNames":["Drug: Conventional drug therapy","Behavioral: Rehabilitation therapy","Behavioral: Breathing training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"TCM acupuncture therapy","description":"TCM acupuncture therapy: Zusanli, Quchi, Hegu, Taichong, Feishu and Fenglong were selected as the main acupoints, and the auxiliary acupoints were selected according to the symptoms, including Fengchi, Dazhui, Lieque, Tiantu, Shenshu, Zhongfu, etc.","armGroupLabels":["the intervention group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Conventional drug therapy","description":"Antibiotics were selected based on drug sensitivity test results.
