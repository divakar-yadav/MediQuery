Patients admitted with stroke diagnosis and with suspected dysphagia that meet the initial inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented into the clinical investigation. Patients who meet the second set of inclusion criteria (dysphagia confirmed by VFS) will be randomized to either active (motor or sensory) or standard treatment (control group) arms.\n\nSubjects included in this clinical investigation will be evaluated at screening, 1-week, 3-months and at 12-months post treatment.\n\nThe main aim of the study will be to assess the effect of VitalStim therapy on improving the safety of swallow according to the VFS, after the treatment and at 1-year follow up, on patients with chronic post-stroke OD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Deglutition Disorders","Stroke"],"keywords":["dysphagia","VitalStim","electrical stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Will not receive any treatment procedure.
