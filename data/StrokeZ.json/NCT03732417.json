It is known that the main cause of stroke is the lack of control of cardiovascular risk factors (CRF). Strategies have been diversified for patients with severe neurological involvement, while those without or with mild involvement, susceptible to repeat a stroke, have a very heterogeneous approach.\n\nObjective: Design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the transversal telematic model of secondary prevention in patients who have suffered a stroke.\n\nMethodology: Randomized clinical trial with a control group, open and multicentre. A total of 70 patients (35 per group) will be included who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of exclusion, attended by an acute stroke in the Hospital Verge de la Cinta de Tortosa. Variables: sociodemographic and clinical, FRC, stage of change, therapeutic compliance and CV. Outcome variables: impact of the stroke using the scale (SIS-16); control of CRF, new vascular events and mortality at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, integrable in the practice and computerized clinical history (HCI). Interventions: control and education for the patient's health to promote self-care and empowerment, and enhance pharmacological compliance. The telematic model has been developed through clinical practice guides of primary care and the most recent publications on the subject referenced. Export of data directly from the HCI.\n\nAnalysis of results with the SPSS 23.0 program, using regression and survival models."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Risk Factor, Cardiovascular"],"keywords":["Nurse's Role","quality of life","adherence","risk factors","stroke","secondary prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Control group included people with ischemic or haemorragic stroke in Terres de l'Ebre, Spain."},{"label":"Telematic model treatment of patients with Stroke","description":"The intervention group included control and education for the patient's health to promote self-care and empowerment, and enhance pharmacological compliance.
