This prevalence didn't change since 15-20 years The fact is that the present undernutrition in the admission deteriorates during the hospitalization.\n\nBesides, the cerebral vascular accident (AVC) complicates the first days, in at least 50 % of the cases, the disorders of the gulp, which are a risk factor of acquired undernutrition. The nutrition holds an important place in the therapeutic coverage of the AVC. Nevertheless, the link between the undernutrition the entrance and the evolution of the AVC is at the moment only little known. The purpose is to study the impact of the undernutrition in the entrance to the hospital (undernutrition previous to the AVC), on the gravity and the evolution"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":73,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rankin score","description":"measurement of Rankin score at the entrance and at the end of hospitalisation","timeFrame":"Day 1; last day of hospitalisation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient admitted in hospital for vascular cerebral accident in 2015\n* thrombolytic treatment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* no thrombolytic treatment\n* transcient ischaemic attack","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patient admitted in hospital for vascular cerebral accident in 2015 with thrombolytic treatment","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"ZUBER Mathieu, Professor","affiliation":"GHPSJ","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph","city":"Paris","state":"Ile-de-France","zip":"75014","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000013927","term":"Thrombosis"},{"id":"D000044342","term":"Malnutrition"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000016769","term":"Embolism and Thrombosis"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000009748","term":"Nutrition Disorders"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M16376","name":"Thrombosis","asFound":"Thrombosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarct","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M24996","name":"Malnutrition","asFound":"Undernutrition","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7474","name":"Embolism","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18818","name":"Embolism and Thrombosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12374","name":"Nutrition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
