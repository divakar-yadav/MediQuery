The enrollment period is expected to last 30 months, and all patients will be followed for 12 months post procedure.\n\nRANDOMIZATION Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the embolic protection device or to a standard cannula in the operating room (OR) immediately after sternotomy and confirmation by the surgical team of the patient's suitability for the proposed intervention (CardioGard embolic protection device). Randomization will be with equal allocation and stratified by site and by procedure (i.e., isolated valve surgery or combined procedures, such as double valve or valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting, CABG). The randomization assignment will be controlled centrally and performed through a web-based data collection system that automates the delivery of the randomization codes. From the point of treatment assignment, primary efficacy will be analyzed by intention-to-treat; that is, the patients will be grouped by their assignments at randomization regardless of whether or not they actually received the treatment to which they were assigned.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION The patient population for this trial consists of patients age ≥ 60 undergoing different types of valve surgery with or without CABG via full or minimal-access sternotomy using legally marketed valve(s). Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria may be included in the study regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Delirium","Ischemic Stroke","Acute Kidney Injury","Heart Valve Disease","Coronary Artery Disease"],"keywords":["Embolic Protection","Cardiac Surgery","CardioGard"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the embolic protection device or to a standard cannula in the OR immediately after sternotomy and confirmation by the surgical team of the patient's suitability for the proposed intervention (CardioGard embolic protection device).","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The nature of the study precludes masking surgeons from treatment assignment.
