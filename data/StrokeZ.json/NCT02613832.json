These impairments favor the prolonged restriction to the bed, which may contribute with changes in respiratory function. In this context, lung re-expansion techniques are used to prevent or treat the various respiratory complications.","detailedDescription":"The survival of patients with lesions in the Central Nervous System is usually accompanied by physical and mental permanents sequelae. This impairment of cognitive status associated with motor injury favors prolonged restriction of these patients to the bed, which may contribute to the emergence of other health damages. In the clinical practice, lung expansion techniques has been used as a prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory conditions that involve volumetric reductions. However, the deficit of awareness and cooperation difficult the use of several therapeutic resources. There are few interventions that could be proposed due to no need the collaboration to be performed, such as Breath Stacking technique (BS) and Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP). The BS is characterized by execution of inspiratory cycles through a one way valve, which allows stacked volume of gas during each inspiration, until it reaches values approximate to maximum inspiratory capacity. While in the EPAP, alveolar pressure is elevated to breath against a expiratory flow resistance generated by a spring load valve. The effects on lung volume promoted BS and EPAP can be safely measured using an electrical impedance tomography (EIT). This recent imaging modality offers information about lung air volumes distribution and have a strong linear correlation with regional ventilation within the thorax.
