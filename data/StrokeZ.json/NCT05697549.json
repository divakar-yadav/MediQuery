Cognitive linguistic quick test (CLQT) and Speech Language unhelpful thoughts and belief scale (SLUTBS) will apply as an assessment. Inclusive criteria include diagnosed male and female post-stroke severe aphasia patients above 30 years of age. These participants must have high instance of unhelpful speech language thoughts and belief. Participants in inclusive criteria must not be participated in any other psychotherapy/ speech language intervention program. Participants must sign an informed consent form. Participants having a caregiver who is willing to be present during the period of intervention. Exclusive criteria include individuals below 30 years of age and patients with aphasia caused by non-stroke etiology.\n\nThe aim of the study is to check the effects of cognitive behavior language therapy on patients with post-stroke aphasia. So, it will help speech language pathologists to adopt the principles of CBLT intervention to treat aphasia that occurs as a result of aphasia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cognitive behavior language therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cognitive behavior language therapy is an extensive form of CBT.
