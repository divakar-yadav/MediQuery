Phase 1 - What is the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of therapy for adults with post-stroke communication impairment? to be followed in 2006 by Phase 2 - What are the effectiveness, costs and service user preferences, for the provision of speech and language therapy for communication difficulties experienced by people in hospital with a stroke? Methodology: Phase 1 - Qualitative (focus groups \\& individual interviews) and quantitative (pilot RCT). Phase 2 - Qualitative (focus groups \\& individual interviews) and quantitative (a pragmatic, multicentred, randomised controlled trial, stratified by diagnosis and therapist/centre, using an 'intention to treat' approach). Discrete choice experiments will be used to determine cost effectiveness.\n\nOutcome Measures: The primary outcome will be functional communicative ability. The economic analysis will estimate the incremental cost effectiveness and net benefit of the intervention group compared to the control group from a societal perspective. The qualitative study will examine service users' and carers' perspectives on the process and effects of Speech and Language Therapy or the control treatment.\n\nSample Group: Adults with dysarthria or aphasia, seen early after admission to hospital with a stroke. Exclusions: subarachnoid haemorrhage, progressive dementia, expected recovery without therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Speech or Language Impairment Following Stroke"],"keywords":["functional communicative ability","cost effectiveness","service user preferences"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"ECT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Speech and Language therapy for dysarthria and/or aphasia"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome will be functional communicative ability."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The economic analysis to estimate incremental cost effectiveness and net benefit of the intervention.
