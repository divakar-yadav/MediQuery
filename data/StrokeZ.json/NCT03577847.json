In this study, the investigators are moving the essential first diagnosis and treatment out into the community close to where the patient live, thus shortening the all important time from debut of symptoms to thrombolytic treatment improving the prognosis of stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is an acute, potentially mutilating disease. To counteract long term sequelae three factors are essential: Ultrarapid diagnosis and treatment, high quality multidiciplinary in-hospital care and optimal long term rehabilitation. Initial diagnosis and treatment has up to now been completed within the hospital domain. This study will change that: moving the essential first diagnosis and treatment out into the community close to where the patient lives thus shortening the all important time from debut of symptoms to thrombolytic treatment. We will operate a local computer tomography (CT) service in the hands of community based non-specialized health care personnel (MD and nurse) acting under direct telemetric guidance from on call hospital specialists. Thus, the investigators will show that by combining current technological advances in real time video communication with an acutely well functioning cooperation between the community and hospital health service personnel the prognosis of stroke patients is improved."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, Thrombolysis, Rural CT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Intervention group: Stroke patients investigated with rural CT scanning at HSS, Ål.
