A dysfunction of this region would result in a disorder of recognition of the orientation of objects and images that the investigators call orientation agnosia. Several isolated cases are reported in the literature but to the investigators knowledge deficit has never been systematically searched, or put into perspective compared to other neuropsychological deficits. Moreover, the precise location of the lesion responsible for such a disorder remains uncertain. The objectives of this study are (1) detect the existence of orientation agnosia in case of right parietal lesion, and (2) to improve the understanding of such a deficit allowing better management of this disorder.","detailedDescription":"Idem"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Lesions"],"keywords":["stroke","parietal lesions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patient with right parietal lesions","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological testing","Other: MRI"]},{"label":"patient with left parietal lesions","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological testing","Other: MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Neuropsychological testing","description":"Experimental test about orientation agnosia and standard neuropsychological tests.","armGroupLabels":["patient with left parietal lesions","patient with right parietal lesions"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"MRI","description":"Cerebral MRI","armGroupLabels":["patient with left parietal lesions","patient with right parietal lesions"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"orientation agnosia evaluation","description":"orientation agnosia test","timeFrame":"1 week to 6 months (average)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"associated clinical symptoms especially apraxia","timeFrame":"1 week to 6 months (average)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age between 18 and 80 years\n* french language\n* right parietal lesion on cerebral imaging (CT-scan is sufficient), including stroke,arterial malformation, isolated tumoral lesion\n* informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* previous neurological history except non complicated migraine and stabilized epilepsia without seizure since 5 years\n* previous psychiatric history except depression without hospitalization \\> one week or anxiety with maximum one anxiolytic treatment\n* drug or alcohol abuse\n* severe cranial traumatism\n* other severe chronic pathology\n* psychotropic medication other than a hypnotic or an anxiolytic at low doses without dose modification for at least one month\n* visual impairment\n* motor or sensory deficit sufficient to render impossible neuropsychological tests\n* patient without judicial or administrative liberty\n* measure of legal protection or no capable to express their consent\n* pregnancy or breastfeeding","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Olivier MARTINAUD, Doctor","affiliation":"Service de neurologie et centre mémoire de ressources et recherche","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de Rouen - Hôpitaux de Rouen","city":"Rouen","state":"Haute-Normandie","zip":"76031","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":49.44313,"lon":1.09932}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000000377","term":"Agnosia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010468","term":"Perceptual Disorders"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3417","name":"Agnosia","asFound":"Agnosia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13069","name":"Perceptual Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T241","name":"Agnosia","asFound":"Agnosia","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
