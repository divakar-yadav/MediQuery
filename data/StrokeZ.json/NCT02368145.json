Brain injury, as caused by stroke, leads to an inflammatory response in the brain which in turn can influence inflammatory and stress responses in other parts of the body outside of the brain. These responses can be measured by analyzing various substances in the blood and in the white blood cells. The investigators will measure these substances (cytokines, glucocorticoids) and compare them to the absence, presence, or degree of depression that the investigators will determine by neurological and psychological testing. The investigators will be drawing blood for this study on admission, at or around day 3, at or around day 7 and at or around day 90, which is not part of routine stroke care. The investigators will be asking subjects to participate in answering question/scales on these same days, some of these questionnaires are also not part of routine stroke care. Standard stroke care is being done other than blood drawing/participating in answering questions/scales. Approximately 25 people will be enrolled over one year.","detailedDescription":"Depression is a common long-term outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and can impede recovery, increase stroke recurrence, and influence mortality from stroke. Based on literature reviewed below, the investigators propose the novel over-arching hypothesis: that post-stroke depression (PSD) occurs in patients who show elevated production of proinflammatory immune cytokines during and/or after stroke, and at the same time present with reduced sensitivity to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids, which otherwise would be expected to have down-regulated cytokine production."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","acute stroke","post stroke depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"whole blood serum"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"• The analysis of the presence of specific inflammatory markers","description":"• Analysis of blood for the presence of Increased proinflammatory cytokines measured in blood plasma and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC),reduced sensitivity to the suppressive effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, on cytokine production and proliferation in stimulated PBMC cultures and high cortisol and ACTH levels","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"presence of depression in people with ischemic stroke","description":"Continuous measures of clinician-rated depression severity and potential co-morbid anxiety will be measured with the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales (Ham-A and Ham-D 46-48). These are widely-used and well-validated rating scales that have been used in a variety of patient populations, and will be supplemented for thoroughness with the Beck Depression Inventory. The presence and history of depression and anxiety disorders will be also be assessed using the Structured Diagnostic Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders depression and anxiety modules (SCID) 49. The SCID is a diagnostic semi-structured interview designed to assess and diagnose mental illnesses as defined by the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), which is the gold standard for diagnosis categorization in the United States.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement and identification stroke location","description":"Localization will occur through neuroimaging by either CT or MRI","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* The subjects will be male and female patients with acute ischemic stroke of the brain.
