And, the usability of the virtual reality-based hemineglect evaluation system is confirmed.","detailedDescription":"This pilot study included 50 stroke patients with right hemisphere lesion and 25 healthy people.\n\nThe normal value for each item is determined based on the result value for each item of the virtual reality (VR)-based hemineglect evaluation system in normal people.\n\nIt is checked whether there is a difference in the results measured using the VR-based hemineglect evaluation system in normal persons, stroke patients with hemineglect, and stroke patients without hemineglect.\n\nStructural validity is confirmed by examining the correlation between the measured values of the virtual VR-based hemineglect evaluation system and Korean Version of Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Behavioral Inattention Test-Conventional (BIT-C) in stroke patients with hemineglect.\n\nCheck the required time and test stability of the evaluation using the VR-based hemineglect evaluation system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke,
