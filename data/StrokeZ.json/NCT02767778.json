Patients will be stimulated with pulsed ELF-MF (75 Hz, 1,8 mT), for 120 min daily, for 5 consecutive days, starting within 48 hours from the onset of stroke.\n\nThe primary outcome will consist of reduction of the expected infarct growth at MR measured in the subacute and chronic phase. Secondary outcomes will explore clinical effectiveness, safety and tolerability of pulsed ELF-MF in acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Neuroprotection","Extremely low frequency magnetic fields"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":124,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"REAL Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive REAL pulsed ELF-MF stimulation and the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke, according to current guidelines.","interventionNames":["Device: REAL Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation"]},{"label":"SHAM Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive SHAM pulsed ELF-MF stimulation and the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke, according to current guidelines.","interventionNames":["Device: SHAM Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"REAL Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation","description":"Within 48 hours from the onset of the stroke, the enrolled patients will undergo to 120 min, daily, pulsed ELF-MF treatment for 5 consecutive days, during their hospital stay.Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation will be administrated by a rectangular, flexible coil, positioned upon the ischemic hemisphere and connected to the pulse generator (B-01; IGEA, Carpi, Italy) producing a single-pulsed signal at 75±2 Hz, with a pulse duration of 1.3 ms and a peak intensity of the magnetic field of 1.8±0.2 mT.","armGroupLabels":["REAL Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SHAM Pulsed ELF-MF stimulation","description":"SHAM pulsed ELF-MF stimulation will be administrated by a rectangular, flexible coil, positioned upon the ischemic hemisphere and connected to the pulse generator (B-01; IGEA, Carpi, Italy).
