Traditional rehabilitative therapies can help regain motor function and ameliorate disability. However, health care reimbursed rehabilitation is usually provided for up to 6 months post stroke (3 months in form of inpatient therapy and 3 months in outpatient therapy). There are increasing community and other facilities offering rehabilitation in form of conventional, recreational and alternative (Yoga, Tai-chi) therapy. However, implementation of these conventional therapy techniques in individuals with neurological disorder impairments is tedious, resource-intensive, and costly, often requiring transportation of patients to specialized facilities. Based on recent evidence suggesting significant benefits of repetitive, task-orientated training, investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative dance and gaming based virtual dance and gaming based therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling individuals with neurological impairments, compared to conventional therapeutic rehabilitation. This pilot study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on compliance and efficacy as well as performing power analysis and sample size calculation for developing it into a randomized controlled trial for extramural funding purposes. The objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility, compliance and efficacy of an alternative dance and gaming-based virtual gaming therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling individuals with neurologically impairment and compare it to that of conventional rehabilitation and also to determine the gains in community participation and integration with longer-term compliance to the dance and gaming -based intervention.","detailedDescription":"This pilot study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on compliance and efficacy as well as performing power analysis and sample size calculation for developing it into a randomized controlled trial for extramural funding purposes. Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of an alternative dance and gaming based cognitive-motor virtual reality therapy to that of a conventional rehabilitation in a clinical setting to improve physical and cognitive function of healthy adults and neurologically impaired community-dwelling individuals under both short duration high intensity and long duration intervention paradigm. The primary safety outcome would be the proportion of patients experiencing intervention-related adverse events during the study period. The primary feasibility outcome would be the total time receiving intervention (i.e. compliance). Motivation index found to correlate highly with compliance will be evaluated by the self-report Intrinsic Motivational Inventory and serve as the secondary factor. The primary efficacy outcome measures to determine improvements in physical function would incorporate main domains: Sensorimotor impairment and function (upper and lower extremity), balance control and fall-risk, cognition, cardiovascular function, and community participation and integration administered pre and post intervention (details in methods). Hypothesis 1: Investigators hypothesize that alternative dance and gaming based cognitive-motor virtual reality therapy and perturbation training would show greater efficacy through improvement in main domains of physical function (sensorimotor, balance control, cognition, fall-risk, and cardiovascular function) compared to the conventional balance training. Aim 2: To determine the compliance and gains in community participation and integration following gaming based virtual reality intervention. Hypothesis 2: With same number of sessions of both types of training, investigators hypothesize that virtual reality based interventions would show better compliance to therapy through better score on Intrinsic Motivational Inventory (IMI) than the conventional therapy. Higher IMI scores in this virtual reality intervention group will be positively correlated with the improvements in quality of life (Motor Activity Log), Community integration (CIQ) and Fall-risk reduction (Falls Efficacy and Activities-specific balance confidence scales).\n\nAim 3: To compare the compliance and effect of a short duration high intensity training (20 sessions over 6 weeks) with a low intensity longer duration (36 sessions over 12 weeks) balance training for the two types of interventions. Hypothesis 3: It is hypothesized that for both types of interventions, short duration high intensity training will be as effective for improvement in physical function as longer duration low intensity training. However, the compliance of short duration training would be greater (higher IMI score) compared to the longer duration training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Intervention provider and assessor were all blinded"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual-reality based dance group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Virtual-reality based dance training - Participants received Virtual-reality based dance training for 6 weeks using the commercially available Kinect dance game (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, U.S.A.) \"Just Dance 3\".
