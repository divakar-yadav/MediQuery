CVA is the third main cause of death and the main source of acquired handicap in adults, as a result it is now a key priority in public health and part of \" The CVA National Action Plan 2013-2014\".\n\nCopeptin is a polypeptide, by- product of Vasopressin metabolism. The increase of Copeptin plasma level, as for Vasopressin, is connected to hydric balance disorders found in cardio-vascular, renal and endocrine diseases. This link has already shown its interest in the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction and, in a more indirect way, CVA.\n\nCopeptin is associated with acute endogenous stress. It seems to have interesting potential in the diagnosis of CVA by its negative predictive value like D-dimeres in pulmonary embolism. Proadrenomedullin and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) are both associated with the prognosis of cardio-vascular diseases and could be interesting in evaluating CVA prognosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"bood test","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Biological: (for each intervention)","Other: Blood test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"(for each intervention)","armGroupLabels":["bood test"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Blood test","armGroupLabels":["bood test"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Determine the minimum level of Copeptin required to determine if the patients present with acute CVA or not.","description":"Copeptin is associated with acute endogenous stress.
