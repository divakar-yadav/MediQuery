Huge social and economic damage arising from cerebrovascular diseases raises the problem of improving medical care for strokes among the most relevant scientific and practical tasks of neurology Regulation of energy metabolism is considered a powerful tool for acute conditions relief, including those that occur due to acute impairment of cerebral blood flow. A number of adjuvant energy protector concomitant medications with systemic pharmacodynamic properties based on signaling (hormonal) and substrate mode of action of succinic acid and other mitochondrial substrates and co-factors was created for this A significant role in the rehabilitation of patients who underwent CS is assigned to the treatment of complications of care in the intensive care unit, the so-called post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which is a set of somatic, neurological, social and psychological consequences of periods in intensive care unit (ICU) conditions that bring limitations to the patient's daily activities In the Brain Institute Clinic (Ekaterinburg), the first results of the metabolic status monitoring during physical and cognitive exercise in patients with PICS were obtained. These results prove that control over metabolic state holds the promise of developing approaches to increasing exercise tolerance Taking into account the effectiveness of Cytoflavin® in treatment of acute impairment of cerebral circulation and consequences of cerebrovascular diseases, on the one hand, and its classification as a metabotropic energy corrector, on the other hand, the evaluation of Cytoflavin® medication tolerability in the integrated program of neurorehabilitation of patients with PICS after ischemic stroke presents a significant interest."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Post Intensive Care Unit Syndrome"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Post-intensive care syndrome","Cytoflavin","Rehabilitation","Metabolograph","Utilization O2","Verticalization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","description":"Patients that receive Cytoflavin® medication i/v drop infusion at a dose of 10 ml of solution for injection per 200 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution for 10 days in addition to a set of neurorehabilitation activities"},{"label":"Group 2","description":"Patients that subjected to the standard set of neurorehabilitation activities for 10 days without being prescribed Cytoflavin® medication"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Median time to achieving gravity gradient of 90°","description":"Median time (in days) to achieving gravity gradient of 90°.","timeFrame":"10 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients who achieved gravity gradient of 90°","description":"Proportion of patients who achieved gravity gradient of 90° by day 5 and 10 days of rehabilitation activities","timeFrame":"5 and 10 days"},{"measure":"Change in of oxygen consumption during 90° verticalization","description":"Change in of oxygen consumption during 90° verticalization","timeFrame":"5 and 10 days"},{"measure":"Change in the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength score","description":"Medical Research Council scale for muscle power (MRC), where 0 -
