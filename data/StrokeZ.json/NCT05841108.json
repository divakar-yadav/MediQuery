In routine training, task-oriented training is usually used for functional training of the hand, which may improve the finger grasping performance after stroke, whereby augmented therapy may lead to a better treatment outcome. Technology-supported training holds opportunities for increasing training intensity. However, most of the hand rehabilitation robots commonly used in the clinic are based on passive training mode and lacks the sensory feedback function of fingers, which is not conducive to patients completing more accurate grasping movements. The force feedback hand rehabilitation robot can make up for the above defects, but its clinical efficacy in stroke patients are not known to date. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness and added value of the force feedback hand rehabilitation robot combined with task-oriented training for stroke patients with hemiplegia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand dysfunction","Force feedback hand rehabilitation robot","Task-oriented training","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: force feedback rehabilitation robot (SEM™ Glove)"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: assisted by a therapist"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"force feedback rehabilitation robot (SEM™ Glove)","description":"In the experimental group, the therapists were asked to illustrate and demonstrate the motor points of the cylindrical grasping and spherical grasping movements, and the patients were instructed to imitate them with nonparalytic hand, while the latter patients wore SEM™ Glove were used for task-oriented training, such as inserting pegs, grasping a ball into a barrel, and drinking water exercises.

The scale ranges from '0 = normal','1','1+','2','3', and '4= worst'.

This study measures ROM of each finger, sum of five fingers flexion ROM, sum of five fingers extension ROM and total ROM of the five fingers. The ROM of each finger is the difference between the total ROM of each finger joint in the extension position and the total ROM of each finger joint in the flexion position. The sum of five finger flexion ROM is the sum of 14 finger joint flexion ROM. The sum of five finger extension ROM is the sum of 14 finger joint extension ROM. The total ROM of the five fingers is the difference between the total ROM of the extension position and the total ROM of the flexion position. The goniometer is used to measure the AROM of the affected hand first, and then the PROM.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline range of motion outcome at 4 weeks"},{"measure":"grip strength","description":"Grip strength of the dominant hand was tested using an isometric hand dynamometer in the testing position recommended by American Society of Hand Therapists(ASHT).
