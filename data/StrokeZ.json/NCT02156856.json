Insufficient stroke volume and/or cardiac output due to hypovolemia or cardiac defects play a central role in causing poor peripheral tissue oxygenation. In order to assess stroke volume, there are numerous invasive and non-invasive methods available. Up to the present date it is unknown, if these methods may by used interchangeably in patients with severe cardiac defects like aortic stenosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodynamic Monitoring","Cardiac Output","Cardiac Surgery"],"keywords":["hemodynamic monitoring","cardiac output","cardiac surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hemodynamic optimisation"},{"label":"No hemodynamic optimisation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of stroke volume (ml) before TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation) by means of (1) FloTrac, (2) transesophageal doppler echocardiography, (3) pulmonary thermodilution via pulmonary artery catheter","timeFrame":"Before Surgery;
