Whether the benefit of EVT in randomized trials could be generalized to clinical practice, especially in developing countries, remains unknown. The Registry was established to evaluate the utilization, and subsequent outcomes of EVT treated AIS patients. This study is a multi-center, prospective registry study initiated by researchers, to investigate Reco ® ,the first clot retriever in china as the primary therapyand remedies in the real world."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Artery Occlusion With Infarction (Disorder)"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","endovascular treatment","registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RECO"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional independence at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale of 0-2)","description":"The range of modified Rankin Scale was from 0 to 6. 0-No symptoms;1-No significant disability;2-Slight disability;3-Moderate disability;4-Moderately severe disability;5-Severe disability;6 -Dead.A higher score indicates worse a outcome.","timeFrame":"[90±7 days after procedure]"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 12-36 hours after the procedure","description":"Heidelberg Bleeding Classification): new intracranial hemorrhage detected by brain imaging associated with ≥4 points total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), ≥2 points in one NIHSS category, leading to intubation/ hemicraniectomy/ EVD placement or other major medical/surgical intervention, or absence of alternative explanation for deterioration","timeFrame":"12-36 hours after the procedure"},{"measure":"Time from symptom onset to recanalization","description":"Minutes","timeFrame":"From the time of symptom onset until the time of of the recanalization of the occluded artery, assessed up to 48 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recanalization rate at the end of the procedure","description":"modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) 2b-3","timeFrame":"Immediately after the procedure"},{"measure":"Recanalization rate after the first attempt","description":"mTICI score 2b-3","timeFrame":"Immediately after the first attempt of endovascular treatment"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS score immediately after the procedure","description":"difference between NIHSS score immediately after the procedure and baseline","timeFrame":"within 2 hours after the procedure"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS score 24 hours after the procedure","description":"difference between NIHSS score 24 hours after the procedure and baseline","timeFrame":"24 hours after the procedure"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS score 7 days after the procedure or at discharge","description":"difference between NIHSS score 7 days after the procedure or discharge and baseline","timeFrame":"7 days after the procedure or discharge"},{"measure":"EQ-5D 90 days after the procedure","description":"EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status.
