Approximately one in five stroke survivors report severe difficulties when listening to speech-in-noise, despite normal hearing, attributed to abnormal processing of sounds within the brain, and these individuals are more likely to experience communication difficulties in poor acoustic environments, The patient with significant auditory deficits and functional limitations may require a range of rehabilitation and remediation approaches. Several studies conclusively demonstrate substantial improvements in speech recognition in noise when using personal frequency-modulated (FM) systems. These devices are used to improve speech perception in noise in adults with neurological disorders including stroke with good immediate benefits. However, the long-term benefits of FM systems in stroke patients has not been studies. In this research study the investigators aimed to investigate the long term benefits in speech reception in noise in non-aphasic stroke patients and measure the potential improvement in unaided speech in background noise performance after 10 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Auditory Processing Disorder, Central","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"standard care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients received standard listening strategies for 10 weeks"},{"label":"intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received an assistive listening device (personal frequency modulated systems) for 10 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: personal frequency modulated systems"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"personal frequency modulated systems","description":"patients used personal frequency modulated systems for at least 4 hours daily for 10 weeks","armGroupLabels":["intervention"],"otherNames":["FM systems"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) benefit for speech in noise (reported in decibel, dB)","description":"Patients are tested in a sound attenuated booth (the crescent of sound) with nine audio stands, an equipment cabinet, and a testing station for the assessment of spatial-listening skills.
