This study will test the hypothesis that in subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic plaques, there will be a positive correlation between carotid artery 68Ga-DOTATATE PET signal and the underlying degree of carotid inflammation measured by immunohistochemical analysis.","detailedDescription":"Clinical events in atherosclerosis are largely driven by inflammation. Molecular imaging of atherosclerosis can potentially identify high-risk lesions, help guide treatment and illuminate the underlying biology of the disease. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET is the gold-standard nuclear molecular imaging technique with well-established roles in atherosclerosis imaging. However, the arterial 18F-FDG signal is non-specific, although it is related to increased macrophage activity with contributions from hypoxia and angiogenesis. Coronary artery imaging with 18F-FDG is particularly difficult, mainly due to high background myocardial cell 18F-FDG uptake, which obscures interpretation of the coronary signal. Efforts to suppress myocardial 18F-FDG uptake with dietary manipulation are challenging for patients and have limited efficacy.\n\nPET tracers currently used in cancer imaging, such as 68Ga-DOTATATE, are potentially more specific for inflammation and also lack myocardial muscle uptake. 68Ga-DOTATATE might therefore be better suited than 18F-FDG for imaging inflammation, particularly within the coronary arteries. The VISION study is a prospective, observational study designed to investigate the biology of plaque inflammation in atherosclerosis, using PET imaging with the somatostatin receptor ligand 68Ga-DOTATATE. 50 subjects with atherosclerosis will undergo sequential PET/CT imaging with 68Ga-DOTATATE and 18F-FDG, along with contrast angiography of the carotid and coronary arteries. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of excised carotid plaques will be used to validate the imaging data. If successful, 68Ga-DOTATATE imaging will offer a cheaper, more specific non-invasive measure of inflammation than 18F- FDG, particularly in the coronary arteries. This opens up the possibility of better risk stratification for patients with atherosclerosis and could provide a non-invasive platform to test the effects of novel anti-atherosclerosis drugs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atherosclerosis","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Chronic Stable Angina","Acute Coronary Syndrome"],"keywords":["Vascular inflammation","Atherosclerosis","Positron Emission Tomography","Molecular Imaging","68Ga-DOTATATE"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Carotid artery plaques"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carotid artery disease","description":"Participants with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid artery plaques"},{"label":"Coronary artery disease","description":"Participants with stable coronary artery disease or recent acute coronary syndrome"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET signal to carotid plaque inflammation","description":"This primary outcome measure is correlation between carotid artery 68Ga-DOTATATE PET signal (TBR) and the underlying degree of carotid inflammation, measured by CD68 immunohistochemistry, in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of 68Ga-DOTATATE signal between symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques","timeFrame":"Baseline (<1 month from event)"},{"measure":"Correlation of carotid artery and coronary artery 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Correlation of Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Scores to arterial 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Correlation between carotid artery 68Ga-DOTATATE autoradiographic signal and degree of carotid inflammation, measured by CD68 immunohistochemistry","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Comparison of myocardial 68Ga-DOTATATE and 18F-FDG uptake","timeFrame":"Baseline (2 scans within 1 week)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥40 years of age\n* Can provide written, fully informed consent\n* Have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke within the preceding four weeks due to carotid artery atherosclerosis; or have ≥30% carotid artery or epicardial coronary artery stenosis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Renal impairment (eGFR\\<30mls/min)\n* History of contrast nephropathy\n* Atrial fibrillation\n* Any condition, in the opinion of the investigator, which prevents the participant from lying flat during scanning\n* Women of childbearing potential\n* Inability to provide written informed consent\n* Haemorrhagic stroke within 3 months of study entry\n* Total occlusion of a culprit carotid artery\n* Any medical condition, vital sign or laboratory value that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the subject ineligible for inclusion","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The study will recruit participants with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke due to carotid artery disease, from which they have made a good functional recovery.
