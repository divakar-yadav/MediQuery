In chronic stroke patients, foot deformity such as pes equinovarus is among the most important underlying motor deficits, due to imbalance of muscle strength and activity around the ankle and tarsal joints. Both nationally and internationally, there is relative underuse of surgical treatment options, although in our clinical experience this often has the best outcome. In addition to positive clinical experiences with surgical interventions, we have experienced that before surgery, there is limited effect of gait training on gait capacity. However, we have experienced that after surgery, the restored normal ankle-foot position creates a new window for training opportunities to further improve gait capacity. Therefore, in this exploratory proof of principle study we aim to investigate the effect of surgical correction of post-stroke foot deformity on the (potential) improvement of gait capacity after gait training. Based on clinical experiences, we expect that after surgery, gait training results in a larger improvement in gait capacity compared to before the surgical intervention due to the increased possibilities to improve balance control.\n\nObjective: The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of gait training on gait capacity (stepping performance, gait adaptability and dynamic balance) before and after surgical correction of post-stroke foot deformity.\n\nStudy design: Exploratory proof of principle study with repeated-measures. Study population: Fifteen stroke patients with disabling foot deformity will be recruited from the Gait Expertise Center (LEC) of the Sint Maartenskliniek and Radboudumc.\n\nIntervention: All patients will receive two gait training interventions, each consisting of twelve one hour training sessions. The training sessions will be focussed on improving gait capacity.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcomes will be gait adaptability as measured with the Emory Function Ambulation Profile (E-FAP), stepping performance as measured with the Timed-Up-And-Go test (TUG) and dynamic balance as measured with the Margin of Stability (MoS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"gait training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Gait adaptability training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Gait adaptability training","description":"All patients will receive two gait training interventions, each consisting of twelve one hour training sessions.

For this test, a standardized ladder is placed on the floor. It consists of 17 rectangular stepping targets that gradually decrease 2 cm in length (range 64-32 cm). Participants start stepping in the largest target and walk as fast as possible to the other side, turn and hit the targets in reverse order while avoiding the ladder rungs. The instructions are to perform the test as fast as possible, without making foot placement errors. The test is timed: a faster time is indicative of a better gait adaptability. Participants perform the test four times, first twice with one foot per target and, thereafter, twice with both feet in one target. A time penalty of 0.5 s is added each time a participant makes a foot placement mistake.","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"Modified Dynamic Gait Index score","description":"Measure for gait adaptability.
