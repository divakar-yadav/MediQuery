The primary endpoint will be improvement on the Berg/Pediatric Balance Scale (BBS) as a measurement of balance and risk of falls.","detailedDescription":"The registry is designed to demonstrate the impact of Exopulse Mollii Suit on improvement and relaxation of muscles, muscle activation, local blood circulation and chronic pain relief.\n\nThe subjects will serve as their own control and the data will be collected before, during and after the treatment period. As the electrical stimulation from the suit usually is above the level of sensation, the study participant cannot be blinded to the treatment.\n\nTo prevent bias, multiple investigators will be collecting the data and only standardized and validated methods will be used. All investigators will be trained on the measurements prior to the registry start.\n\nAdditionally, all investigators are trained and certified in the Exopulse method, and the generic stimulation settings are selected according to a standardized matrix based on the subjects' age and level of impairment.\n\nRe-assessments during scheduled visits are part of normal routine and use. The decision whether the subjects will be enrolled in the registry is separated from the subject's decision to use the device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Palsy","Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Spinal Cord Injuries","Neurologic Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Exopulse Mollii Suit","description":"The registry is designed to demonstrate the impact of Exopulse Mollii Suit on improvement of muscle relaxation, muscle activation, local blood circulation and/or chronic pain relief.

A score equal to or below 45 is commonly associated with risk of fall across the literature.","timeFrame":"To be assessed at baseline, after 60 minutes stimulation (T1), after 4 weeks (T4) and at the end of the 12-week intervention period (T12)."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed Up and Go (TUG), if applicable for the patient","description":"Change in walking velocity will be assessed with TUG. Patients have to stand up from a chair when they hear the verbal instruction \"go\", walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down. Timing starts with the verbal instruction \"go' and stops when the patients return to the seated position. The score consists of the time taken to complete the test activity, measured in seconds.","timeFrame":"To be assessed at baseline, immediately after 60 minutes stimulation (T1), 4 weeks after first visit (T4) and at the end of the 12-week intervention period (T12)."},{"measure":"10 m Walk Test, if applicable for the patient","description":"The 10mWT is used to assess the change in walking speed in meters/second (m/s) over a short distance.","timeFrame":"To be assessed at baseline, immediately after 60 minutes stimulation (T1), 4 weeks after first visit (T4) and at the end of the 12-week intervention period (T12)."},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test, if applicable for the patient","description":"The change in upper motor ability will be assess with WMFT.

The FIQ evaluates the function, overall impact and symptoms of fibromyalgia over the last 7 days.\n\nThe FIQ is composed of 10 items. The first item contains 11 questions related to physical functioning - each question is rated on a 4 point Likert type scale. Items 2 and 3 ask the patient to mark the number of days they felt well and the number of days they were unable to work (including housework) because of fibromyalgia symptoms. Items 4 through 10 are horizontal linear scales marked in 10 increments on which the patient rates work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety and depression.","timeFrame":"To be assessed at baseline, immediately after 60 minutes stimulation (T1), 4 weeks after first visit (T4) and at the end of the 12-week intervention period (T12)."},{"measure":"Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, if applicable for the patient","description":"The change in back pain will be assessed with Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale.
