Objective of the study was to assess the changes in gait capabilities, muscle tone and daily activities in patients after a recent stroke who underwent a 6-week supervised rehabilitation process using exercises on the LUNA EMG neurorehabilitation robot. A total of 60 participants with impaired motor function and gait after subacute stroke were included in the study. Each patient was randomly assigned to an intervention (robot) or control group (RG or CG). All patients, except standard therapy, underwent 1 session of therapy per day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. People with RG had 30 minutes of training sessions on the Luna EMG robot, while CG received exercises on the lower limb rotor. Patients were evaluated before the start of the study, and then after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of therapy using the Ashworth scale, Rivermead mobility index (RMI), Repty functional index, Time Up and Go test (TUG) and muscle circumference on the thigh."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke,","rehabilitation,","EMG-triggered rehabilitation,","robotic-assisted movement,","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":71,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A four-week rehabilitation program (Monday to Friday) involving the hour of individual therapy and 30 minutes of therapy on the Luna EMG device.","interventionNames":["Device: Luna EMG"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"OTHER","description":"A four-week rehabilitation program (Monday to Friday) involving one hour of individual therapy and 30 minutes on lower limb rotor","interventionNames":["Device: lower limb rotor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Luna EMG","description":"The duration of the overall therapeutic intervention in both groups will be the same.","armGroupLabels":["Study Group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"lower limb rotor","description":"The duration of the overall therapeutic intervention in both groups will be the same.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Timed up and go test results","description":"the test is performed from a sitting position.
