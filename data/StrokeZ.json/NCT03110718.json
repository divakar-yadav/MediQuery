Armeo Power® (AP) is a robotic exoskeleton for rehabilitation allowing early rehabilitation treatment. The objective of our study was to determine whether AP training coupled with MV applied on antagonist muscles of the spastic upper limb (UL) can reduce the spasticity of agonist muscles. We enrolled 20 chronic post-stroke patients, who underwent 40 daily sessions of AP training. Ten subjects (group-A) received muscle MV (on triceps brachii, deltoid, and supraspinatus), whereas the other 10 (group-B) underwent a sham vibration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["robotic rehabilitation","muscle vibration","combined approach"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ArmeoP+real MV","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients underwent forty 1h Armeo-P training sessions (i.e. five times a week for eight consecutive weeks). During the first session, the device was adjusted to the patient's arm size and the angle of suspension. The working space and the exercises were selected once the UL had been fitted with the system. All the subjects in the arm received a focal belly-muscle vibration on the spastic antagonist muscles (i.e. triceps brachialis-TB, deltoid-DE, and supraspinatus-SS) during shoulder abduction and elbow extension. MV was delivered by a pneumatic vibrator powered by compressed air, wired to appropriate-muscle probe diameter (up to 2cm2). MV was set at a frequency of 80Hz and an individually adjusted vibration amplitude so that it was just below the threshold for perceiving an illusory movement.
