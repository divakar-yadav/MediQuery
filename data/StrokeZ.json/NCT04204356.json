Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques like transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have been found to improve aphasia treatment effects in post stroke patient populations such as improved naming abilities.\n\nHowever, the effect of tDCS on more functional, higher level language skills such as discourse production (i.e. story telling, giving instructions) has yet to be understood.Therefore the aim of this study is to determine the potential effectiveness of tDCS as an adjunct to speech and language therapy (SLT) to improve discourse speech production in people with post-stroke aphasia. It is hypothesised that SLT combined with tDCS will result in greater improvements in discourse language production compared to SLT on its own."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke","Language Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomly allocated to this group using a random number generator will receive a once weekly, 6-week block of language treatment with active tDCS.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Language treatment for improving discourse production","Device: Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"Sham group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants randomly allocated to this group using a random number generator will receive a once weekly, 6-week block of language treatment without active tDCS (sham)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Language treatment for improving discourse production"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Language treatment for improving discourse production","description":"All participants will receive a 6-week block of language treatment for improving verb retrieval in discourse production by a professional speech and language therapist.

There are 8 questionnaires to select from with scales that vary in relation to gender and race. Pictorial responses can be translated into numerical scores, and then documented on a summary score sheet. The questionnaire has three sections; communication, participation and well-being/emotional state. The first section looks at activities which are commonly difficult for people with aphasia such as talking and understanding. The participation section looks at how communication difficulties arising from aphasia impact the person's ability to complete tasks in everyday life such as shopping and work. The last section looks at the emotional effect of aphasia.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)","description":"HADS is a 14-item scale which assesses non-somatic anxiety and depression symptoms.
