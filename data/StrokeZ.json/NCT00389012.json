In addition, we want to determine if training programs that combine leg strength training to treadmill walking provide an additional benefit to post-stroke walking outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Impaired walking ability is a hallmark residual deficit that contributes to post-stroke walking disability . Impairment in lower extremity muscle strength is a significant contributor to decreased walking speed after stroke. No studies have combined task-specific locomotor training in combination with lower extremity strength training programs designed to improve post-stroke walking outcomes.\n\nParticipants will include individuals who are ambulatory, but walk slower than 1.0 m/sec and are at least 6 months post unilateral stroke.\n\nParticipants are stratified by initial comfortable walking speed (moderate \\>0.5 m/sec; severe \\<= 0.5 m/sec) and randomized to one of four exercise pairs: 1) body-weight supported treadmill training (BWST) and locomotor-based strength training (resistive cycling task, LBST), 2) BWST and LE muscle-specific strength training (MSST), 3) BWST and upper extremity ergometry (SHAM), and 4) LBST and SHAM. Training will occur 4 times per week for 6 weeks (24 total sessions). Exercise type in each exercise pair is alternated daily.\n\nPrimary outcomes include comfortable and fast overground walking speed, and distance walked in 6-minutes measured at baseline, after 12 and 24 treatment sessions and at a 6-month follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","hemiplegic gait","exercise therapy","physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"exercise therapy"},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"walking rehabilitation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"walking speed (meters/second)"},{"measure":"walking distance (distance walked in 6-minutes)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lower extremity Fugl-Meyer"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Score"},{"measure":"Lower extremity torque"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale"},{"measure":"SF-36"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age 18 years or older\n* 4 months to 5 years after first-time onset of a ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) confirmed by CT, MRI, or clinical criteria\n* able to ambulate at least 14 meters with assistive and/or orthotic device and one person assist (minimum Functional Ambulation Classification Level II\n* self-selected walking velocity of â‰¤1.0 meters/second\n* approval of primary care physician to participate.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* resting systolic blood pressure greater than 180mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110mmHg and/or resting heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute;\n* lower limb orthopedic conditions such as prior joint replacement or range of motion limitations;\n* spasticity management that included Botox injection (\\< 4 months earlier) or phenol block injection (\\< 12 months earlier) to affected lower extremity and intrathecal Baclofen or oral Baclofen (within past 30 days);\n* Mini-Mental State Exam score \\< 24;\n* currently receiving lower extremity strengthening exercises or gait training,\n* past participation in any study examining the effects of long term (\\>4 weeks training) body weight support treadmill training; limb loaded pedaling, or lower extremity strengthening;\n* plans to move out of the area in the next year,\n* no transportation to the study site for all evaluations and intervention sessions.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Katherine J Sullivan, PhD, PT","affiliation":"Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"David A Brown, PhD, PT","affiliation":"Department of Physical Therapy and Movement Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Sara Mulroy, PhD, PT","affiliation":"Pathokinesiology Laboratory, Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, Downey, California","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rancho Los Amigos","city":"Downey","state":"California","zip":"90242","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":33.94001,"lon":-118.13257}},{"facility":"University of Southern California","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California","zip":"90089","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":34.05223,"lon":-118.24368}},{"facility":"Northwestern University","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60611","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17895349","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Sullivan KJ, Brown DA, Klassen T, Mulroy S, Ge T, Azen SP, Winstein CJ; Physical Therapy Clinical Research Network (PTClinResNet).
