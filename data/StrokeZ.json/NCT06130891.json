The main aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated approach and its impact on motor function, sensory processing, and cognitive skills in sub-acute stroke patients, with the goal of contributing to the development of more efficient rehabilitation interventions for UL sensory-motor impairments after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is not only associated with a high mortality rate, but It also leads to major disabilities. The American Heart Association reported that nearly 75% of stroke victims have dysfunction and 15-30% of stroke survivors have severe disability. Stroke survivors often suffer from impaired motor function, sensory processing, and cognitive abilities depending on the severity and site of the lesion, severely impacting their functional independence and quality of life. About 80% of stroke survivors experience some degree of impairment in their UL which includes loss of dexterity, abnormal muscle tone, loss of coordinated movements, and diminished sensations depending upon to nature of the lesion.\n\nCognitive exercise treatment is a motor learning model that focuses on high-level cognitive function and occurs through the integration of perception-cognition-activity processes, such as motor regulation. Activation of the brain's cognitive process, which includes perception, memory, attention, language, and decision-making, is the core of cognitive training. Most studies have focused on either sensory, motor, or cognitive interventions separately, overlooking the potential benefits of simultaneously addressing these domains. This combined intervention targets not only motor skills, but also cognitive skills, sensory processing, and manual dexterity. By addressing physical and cognitive domains simultaneously, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated approach and its impact on motor function, sensory processing, and cognitive skills in sub-acute ischemic stroke patients, with the goal of contributing to the development of more efficient rehabilitation interventions for UL sensory-motor impairments after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic"],"keywords":["cognitive exercise therapy","sensory motor relearning","upper limb function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cognitive sensory motor relearning Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cognitive, sensory, and motor training","interventionNames":["Other: Cognitive sensory motor relearning"]},{"label":"Sensory Motor Relearning Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sensory and motor training","interventionNames":["Other: Sensory motor relearning"]},{"label":"Motor Relearning Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Motor training","interventionNames":["Other: Motor Relearning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cognitive sensory motor relearning","description":"Cognitive Exercises:\n\n* Orientation: Checking awareness of date, time, and weather.\n* Attention: Tasks like connecting dots or spotting differences.\n* Shape Sorting: Sorting objects by size, color, etc.\n* Calculation Training: Counting money, beads, basic arithmetic.\n* Memory: Recalling objects on a tray, numbers backward, word associations.\n\nSensory Relearning:\n\n* Discrimination: Identifying textures, shapes, sizes, and temperatures.\n* Tactile Recognition: Recognizing objects through touch.\n* Proprioception: Matching affected limb's position to unaffected limb's.\n\nMotor Relearning:\n\n* Task-Specific Training: Grasping, pouring, wiping, screwing, holding objects.\n* Progression: Increasing duration, intensity, and resistance. 45 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Cognitive sensory motor relearning Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sensory motor relearning","description":"Sensory Relearning:\n\n* Discrimination: Identifying textures, shapes, sizes, and temperatures.\n* Tactile Recognition: Recognizing objects through touch.\n* Proprioception: Matching affected limb's position to unaffected limb's.\n\nMotor Relearning:\n\n* Task-Specific Training: Grasping, pouring, wiping, screwing, holding objects.\n* Progression: Increasing duration, intensity, and resistance. 45 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Sensory Motor Relearning Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor Relearning","description":"Motor Relearning:\n\n* Task-Specific Training: Grasping, pouring, wiping, screwing, holding objects.\n* Progression: Increasing duration, intensity, and resistance. 45 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Motor Relearning Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test","description":"Changes from baseline The instrument contains 19 items grouped into 4 sub-tests: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross motor.

It consists of 72 items grouped into three sub-scales measuring tactile sensation, proprioception, and stereognosis. The Tactile Sensation subscale includes light touch, temperature, pinprick, pressure, tactile localization, and bilateral simultaneous touch. Higher scores demonstrate better somatosensory function.","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"ABILHAND questionnaire (ABIL)","description":"Changes from baseline ABILHAND is an inventory of 23 manual activities that the patient is originally asked to judge on a 3-level scale: 0 (impossible), 1 (difficult), and 2 (easy). The test explores bi-manual activities done without other human or technical help. For each question the patient provided his/her feeling of difficulty irrespective of the limb(s) actually used to do the activity. Activities not attempted in the last 3 months are not scored and encoded as missing responses.","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)","description":"Changes from baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a one-page, 30-point cognitive screening measurement scale that takes about 10 minutes to administer.
