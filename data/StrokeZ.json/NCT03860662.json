The hemiplegia table, which develops after subsiding, brings many problems along with it. Spasticity is one of these problems. Spasticity frequently leads to difficulty in the activities of daily life. It delays functional recovery, causes pain, and leads to secondary complications.\n\nThe objective of spasticity treatment minimizes the negative effects of hypertension without endangering function. Systematic medication treatment (baclofen, diazepam, dantrolen, and tizanidine) or local treatment (botulinum toxin, phenyl injection) are administered in spasticity treatment. The botulinum toxin prevents the secretion of acetylcholine in nerve endings and creates a presynaptic neuromuscular block. There are numerous studies that show that botulinum toxin is effective in spasticity.\n\nBaclofen is a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist. It passes through the blood-brain barrier and binds to the GABAb receptors of the spinal cord. Baclofen decreases spasms, clonus, and resistance to germs.\n\nVarious studies of electrophysiological reflexes are conducted to evaluate spasticity and to study neuronal circuits. The electrophysiological test is a tool used in studying the changes in spinal cord function and spinal reflexes in patients. The flexor reflex known as the recoil reflex is a polysynaptic and multisegmental reflex. It provides for avoidance and protection from internal and external stimulants that may be harmful for the body.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to research the effect of oral baclofen treatment and botulinum toxin injection treatments over the electromyographic nociceptive flexor reflex (NFR) threshold in hemiplegic patients with spasticity.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH The purpose of this thesis is to research the effect of oral baclofen treatment and botulinum toxin injection treatments over the electromyographic nociceptive flexor reflex (NFR) threshold in hemiplegic patients with spasticity.
