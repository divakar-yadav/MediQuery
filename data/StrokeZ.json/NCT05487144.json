Phase 2 of the study is the 8 week intervention implementation.Participants will access the V.E. community from their homes on a computer with broadband internet. During the first four weeks of the intervention, participants will be required to come into the V.E. at least once per week for at least one hour. For the last four weeks, V.E. participation is strongly encouraged, but not required. The content in the V.E. will focus on psychosocial health and stroke recovery, and the messaging in the VE will be updated bi-weekly to encourage retention and engagement. Group meetings led by the study PI, a psychologist, or another trained member of the research team at least once a week will be offered. During the intervention period, VE-specific data will be collected continuously. Phase 3, will include a survey and a focus group interview via online platform.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of participants enrolled in the study","description":"This will be defined as the number enrolled divided by the number of eligible individuals screened","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline of last participant )"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of participants who complete the study","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline of last participant )"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of participants who complete the data collection forms","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline of last participant )"},{"measure":"Usability as assessed by the perceived usefulness score","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Usability as assessed by the perceived ease of use scores","description":"This has 10 items, each scored form 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree), higher score meaning higher perceived ease of use","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Usability as assessed by the number of times the participants log in","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Usability as assessed by the time spent in the environment in minutes","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Acceptability as assessed by the number of VE Meetings attended","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Acceptability as assessed by the number of VE objects manipulated","description":"Objects manipulated are the resources interacted with","timeFrame":"post intervention (8 weeks form baseline)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in perceived social support as assessed by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)","description":"This is a 12 item scale , each question is scored from 1(very strongly disagree) to 7(very strongly agree) for a maximum score of score of 84, a higher number indicating more social support","timeFrame":"Baseline, post intervention (8 weeks after baseline)"},{"measure":"Change in post stroke depression as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (PHQ-9)","description":"This is a 9 item questionnaire, each scored from 0(not at all) to 3(nearly every day), a higher number indication g more depression","timeFrame":"Baseline, post intervention (8 weeks after baseline)"},{"measure":"Change in anxiety as assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score","description":"This is a 7 item questionnaire, each is scored from 0(not at all) to 3(nearly every day) a higher number indicating more anxiety","timeFrame":"Baseline, post intervention (8 weeks after baseline)"},{"measure":"Change in loneliness as assessed by the UCLA loneliness scale scores","description":"This is a 20 item questionnaire, each one is scored form 1(never) to 4(always).
