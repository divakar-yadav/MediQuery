After initial assessment, the participants will be randomly assigned in 4 groups (the treatment or control) with approx.20 participants in each group.\n\nIn all participants, the following parameters will be assessed: medical records, stroke characteristics, sleep characteristics, cardiovascular circadian rhythms and blood samples for the evaluation of circadian molecular biomarkers at baseline and 14 days after inclusion. Stroke outcomes will be reassessed at 3-month follow-up.\n\nThe following associations will be assessed:\n\n* the role of blue light exposure and melatonin treatment for stroke outcome\n* the role of blue light exposure and melatonin treatment in the modulation of sleep parameters in acute stroke\n* the association of molecular biomarkers of circadian rhythms with stroke outcome (the difference in neurological and functional deficit from admission to 14 and 90 days after study inclusion), with stroke characteristics (stroke subtype and neuroimaging stroke parameters, routine protocol) and with sleep characteristics.\n* the association of sleep characteristics with stroke outcome (the difference in neurological and functional deficit from admission to 14 and 90 days after stroke) and with stroke characteristics (stroke subtype and neuroimaging stroke parameters, routine protocol)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute","Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm"],"keywords":["circadian misalignment","neuroplasticity","melatonin","light therapy","circadian disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"patients will be randomized into 4 parallel groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Blue light exposure + Melatonin treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will receive the combination of blue light exposure according to the protocol described by Killgore et al.
