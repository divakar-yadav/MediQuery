Data will be collected from stroke patients from Government Mian Munshi hospital (DHQ) and Riphah Rehabilitation center. A consecutive sampling technique will be use which is based on 6 months' time period. TIS (Trunk Impairment Scale), BBS (Berg Balance Scale), 10 MWT (Meter Walk Test) will be used as a tool to collect the data. SPSS 21 version will be used for data entry and analysis.\n\nThis study will provide the effects of PNF patterns training on the trunk control, balance, and gait ability in chronic stroke patients. All possible patients will be taken using random sampling. Single plane training and diagonal pattern training will use. The subjects will randomly assign to the experiment group (diagonal pattern training) and the control group (single plane training). Diagonal pattern training will modified with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique's chopping and lifting pattern to create 10 movements.\n\nInformed consent will be taken from all patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["stroke","Gait Disorder","Balance; Disorder,"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"total 30 subjects will be randomly assigned to the experiment group (diagonal pattern training) and the control group (single plane training).Diagonal pattern training will be modified with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique's chopping and lifting pattern to create 10 movements.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"diagonal pattern training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"diagonal pattern training group will involve performance of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique's chopping and lifting pattern to create 10 movements.","interventionNames":["Other: diagonal pattern training"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"in control group patients will perform movements in single plane","interventionNames":["Other: single plane training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"diagonal pattern training","description":"patients will receive proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique's chopping and lifting pattern to create 10 movements.","armGroupLabels":["diagonal pattern training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"single plane training","description":"patients will receive single plane training of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation in control group","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Trunk Impairment Scale","description":"This test is used to assess balance and function of trunk in stroke patients","timeFrame":"Six months"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"To assess whole body balance","timeFrame":"Six months"},{"measure":"10 Meter Walk Test","description":"To assess dynamic mobility","timeFrame":"Six months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Chronic stroke patients whose onset of stroke was at least 6 months to two years\n* Ability to maintain an independent standing posture for 30s, ability to walk 30m alone indoor.\n* Patient with the ability to communicate enough and to understand oral instructions given by the therapist.\n* Patients who were not using assistive devices\n* Patients receiving drug therapy of internal medicine for the alleviation of spasticity.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unconscious patients.\n* Patients undergone Spine surgery.\n* Patients with Hemi neglect.\n* Sensory ataxia or cerebellar ataxia.\n* Coronary heart disease (CHD) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\n* Cardio respiratory problems.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"zeest hashmi, MSNMPT","affiliation":"Riphah International University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Riphah International University","city":"Islamabad","state":"Fedral","zip":"44000","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":33.72148,"lon":73.04329}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"30791703","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Van Criekinge T, Truijen S, Schroder J, Maebe Z, Blanckaert K, van der Waal C, Vink M, Saeys W.
