For several years patients with OSA have an increased likelihood of having irregular heartbeats. This study will determine how often patients with OSA have irregular heartbeats. This study will also define which OSA patients are most likely to have irregular heartbeats.\n\nThe participant is being asked to be in the study because the participant has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Arrhythmia","Stroke, Cardiovascular"],"keywords":["sleep apnea","arrhythmia detection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":86,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cardiac event monitor","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will under go evaluation with a two week cardiac event monitor.","interventionNames":["Device: The Lifestar Act III"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"The Lifestar Act III","description":"The Lifestar Act III is a chest-worn continuous Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and arrhythmia detector.
