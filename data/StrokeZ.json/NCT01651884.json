Traditional tDCS has recently been modified to deliver current to more specific locations in the brain. This new delivery method is called high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS). It is not known whether traditional tDCS (more diffuse current delivery) or HD-tDCS (more focal current delivery) will be the better approach for enhancing treatment outcomes. To answer this question, computerized speech-language treatment will be administered during the application of the different forms of brain stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Aphasia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Anomia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-Definition tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: HD-tDCS (Soterix)"]},{"label":"Sponge tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (Neuroconn)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"HD-tDCS (Soterix)","description":"Subjects will be given individualized dose (number of electrodes and electrode placement) through High-Definition electrodes to target fMRI determined targets","armGroupLabels":["High-Definition tDCS"],"otherNames":["Soterix Medical High-Definition M x N stimulator","Soterix Medical HDTargets"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (Neuroconn)","armGroupLabels":["Sponge tDCS"],"otherNames":["Neuroconn"]}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. one-time ischemic stroke in the left hemisphere\n2. greater than 6-months post-stroke onset\n3. between 25 and 80 years of age\n4. aphasia diagnosis (as determined by pre-treatment language-based testing)\n5. right-handed (before the stroke)\n6. native speaker of English\n7. ability to provide informed written or verbal consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. clinically reported history of dementia, alcohol abuse, psychiatric disorder, traumatic brain injury, or extensive visual acuity or visual-spatial problems\n2. factors contraindicative of tDCS administration (sensitive scalp, previous brain surgery)\n3. prior history of epileptic or unprovoked seizures occurring during the previous 12 months.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Julius Fridriksson, PhD","affiliation":"University of South Carolina","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001037","term":"Aphasia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000013064","term":"Speech Disorders"},{"id":"D000007806","term":"Language Disorders"},{"id":"D000003147","term":"Communication Disorders"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4042","name":"Aphasia","asFound":"Aphasia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3865","name":"Anomia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15554","name":"Speech Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10513","name":"Language Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6064","name":"Communication Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
