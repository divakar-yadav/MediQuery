Due to the brutality of stroke and increasingly shorter in-hospital lengths of stay, patients and their families must adapt quickly to the patient's new health functioning and the new caregiving and support role for family members.\n\nPeer support could be an innovative and inexpensive approach to addressing these issues. Peer-helpers are patient-partners who put their experiential knowledge from life with the disease at the disposal of other patients to offer them social and emotional support in the management of the disease in connection with care, social and community structures. Group peer support programs face organizational challenges and fail to address the full range of patient needs for stroke home visits. Individualized and more flexible support could better meet the needs of patients. Our hypothesis is that individual peer support improves quality of life and patient empowerment during the discharge period compared to usual practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Peer support"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For 6 months after discharge, patients in the intervention group will benefit from peer support by a trained patient (number and frequency of contacts defined according to the patient's needs).\n\nThe intervention aims to improve the patient's ability to manage his or her situation and meet his or her needs upon discharge at home, including identifying and seeking for the necessary health or social resources","interventionNames":["Other: Peer support"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients included in the control group before intervention will receive the usual practices.
