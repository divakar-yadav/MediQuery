Prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. This study specifically aims to emulate a prospective surveillance of the effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) vs. a comparator, warfarin, in older adults with atrial fibrillation and different frailty status. This program will be enhanced by incorporating a novel claims-based frailty index, which has been shown useful in assessing how the benefits and harms of drug therapy vary by frailty.","detailedDescription":"Data sources of use for this study are: Medicare Database, Optum Database, and MarketScan Research Database. All data from years 2013-2020 (available data may vary depending on the database) will be analyzed in the study.\n\nThis study follows a sequential cohort monitoring design. The monitoring analysis will include 1) retrospective analysis of available data (2013-2018) at the time of first analysis (April 2021) and 2) prospective analysis of new data (2019-2020) as they become available to the researchers. Within each database and by frailty status (frail vs non-frail), the investigators will emulate annual updating of data by creating a propensity score (PS)-matched cohort of new users every 1-year interval. Each sequential cohort will be followed for development of the outcomes of interest. At the end of each interval, time-to-event data from all sequential cohorts will be pooled for outcome analysis. The surveillance will be performed by frailty status (frail vs non-frail) at the time of drug initiation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Frailty","Anticoagulant-induced Bleeding","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Warfarin","description":"New users of warfarin","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]},{"label":"Dabigatran","description":"New users of dabigatran","interventionNames":["Drug: Dabigatran"]},{"label":"Rivaroxaban","description":"New users of rivaroxaban","interventionNames":["Drug: Rivaroxaban"]},{"label":"Apixaban","description":"New users of apixaban","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban"]},{"label":"Edoxaban","description":"New users of edoxaban","interventionNames":["Drug: Edoxaban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin","description":"Initiation of warfarin, identified using prescription fill in pharmacy claims","armGroupLabels":["Warfarin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dabigatran","description":"Initiation of dabigatran, identified using prescription fill in pharmacy claims","armGroupLabels":["Dabigatran"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rivaroxaban","description":"Initiation of rivaroxaban, identified using prescription fill in pharmacy claims","armGroupLabels":["Rivaroxaban"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"Initiation of apixaban, identified using prescription fill in pharmacy claims","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edoxaban","description":"Initiation of edoxaban, identified using prescription fill in pharmacy claims","armGroupLabels":["Edoxaban"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients with composite events of stroke or systemic embolism","description":"Stroke OR systemic embolism, identified by relevant diagnoses in the claims data","timeFrame":"January 2013 -
