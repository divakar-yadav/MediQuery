A series of complementary, overlapping clinical trials and development activities will validate and optimize the use of robot-assisted upper limb therapy for neuro rehabilitation.\n\nWe have developed a robotic system that assists or resists elbow and shoulder movements in three dimensional space. In addition to unilateral exercise modes, a novel bimanual mode enables hemiparetic subjects to practice mirror image upper limb exercises.","detailedDescription":"Randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. MIME incorporates a PUMA 560 robot that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral, and combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular","Hemiplegia","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1 hour/day of mechanically-assisted upper limb therapy","interventionNames":["Device: Robot-assisted therapy"]},{"label":"2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"1 hour/day of upper limb therapy that includes exposure to, but no manipulation by the robot","interventionNames":["Device: Traditional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot-assisted therapy","description":"1 hour/day of mechanically-assisted upper limb therapy","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Traditional therapy","description":"1 hour/day of upper limb therapy that includes exposure to, but no manipulation by the robot","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer score","timeFrame":"end of training, 6-month follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nStroke patients\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nUnable to follow instructions; medically unstable.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Charles Burgar, MD","affiliation":"Central Texas Veterans Health Care System","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Central Texas Veterans Health Care System","city":"Temple","state":"Texas","zip":"76504","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":31.09823,"lon":-97.34278}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Acute Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
