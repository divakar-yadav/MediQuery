Variety of interventions are adopted to improve muscle strength after stroke. These include progressive resistance training, specific task training or functional training, functional electrical stimulation and high intensity aerobic exercises","detailedDescription":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) is a relatively new treatment approach for stroke recovery. TDCS is a neuromodulation method which involves application of weak direct current stimulations over the scalp via electrodes. It could induce plasticity via modulation of resting membrane potential and modification of spontaneous discharge rate.\n\nTDCS has been shown to have beneficial effects on mobility, muscle strength, motor learning, lower limb function, balance, gait, functionality and walking ability in post stroke patients. TDCS appears to be a promising intervention for stroke patients however its effects are not significant if used in isolation. Thus, it should be used as an adjunct to some other treatment.\n\nReview of available literature indicates TDCS can be a good option in short and intermediate run but its effects in the long run have not been studied yet. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge there is little literature available about the long-term effects of TDCS on muscle strength in subacute stage. Therefore, this study is designed to test the long-term effects of TDCS stimulation on subacute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Strength","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"receive Anodal TDCS with spongy electrodes applied to the M1 (supplementary motor area) of the skull which corresponds to C3 and C4 on the 10/20 EEG system.

It is an important part of assessment in many patient groups including patients with stroke, spinal cord injury, neuropathy and other neurological and musculoskeletal conditions. The patient can be scored by 5 grades where grade 5 is the patient completes full ROM against maximum resistance from therapist, grade 4 is patient completes full ROM against moderate resistance, grade 3 is patient completes full ROM against gravity, grade 2 is completion of ROM with gravity eliminated, grade 1 is flickering of muscles when movement is attempted and grade 0 is when there is no palpable contraction or flickering. A review on the validity and reliability of MMT reported ICC values of up to 0.96 suggesting it is a reasonably valid tool to assess muscle strength The assessment will be made at baseline, fourth and eighth week","timeFrame":"8th week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"BBS is used to objectively determine a patient's ability to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks.

The maximum score is 56 indicating normal function. A score of 41 to 56 indicates mild risk fall, 21 to 40 indicates medium risk fall and 0 to 20 indicates high risk fall.
