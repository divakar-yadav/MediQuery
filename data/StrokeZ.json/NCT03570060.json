In this prospective work, the investigators will rely on the Dijon Stroke Registry, which collects extensive clinical data for each patient hospitalized for a stroke. As part of this registry, patients are seen 6 months after stroke to assess their clinical status. This clinical follow-up will allow us to judge the evolution of the AF diagnosed during the acute episode at a distance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Blood sample","description":"2 ml of blood for testing for serum biomarkers (IL-6, GDF-15, soluble ST-2 soluble, osteoprotegerin, galectin 3)"},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Long term ECG monitor","description":"Fitting and removal of a long term ECG monitor (SpiderFlash, LivaNova)"},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Monitoring ECG","description":"Recording of automatic ECG monitor results (CSM Philips IntelliVue MP50 system)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation during continuous monitoring in a Stroke unit within six months of stroke.","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient who had an ischemic stroke defined according to WHO criteria and hospitalized in the Stroke Unit at the Dijon University Hospital.\n* Patient 18 years of age and older\n* Patient who has given oral consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Person not affiliated to a national health insurance scheme\n* Protected adult\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding woman\n* Patient refusing to participate in the study\n* Transfer planned after the stay in the Stroke Unit to a department outside the Dijon University Hospital, not allowing for the long term screening with an external ECG monitor\n* History of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter\n* Patient wearing a pacemaker or defibrillator with an atrial lead","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Hospitalized patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Charles GUENANCIA","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0380293535","email":"charles.guenancia@chu-dijon.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Dijon Bourgogne","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Dijon","zip":"21079","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Charles GUENANCIA","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0380293535","email":"charles.guenancia@chu-dijon.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35911547","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Garnier L, Duloquin G, Meloux A, Benali K, Sagnard A, Graber M, Dogon G, Didier R, Pommier T, Vergely C, Bejot Y, Guenancia C.
