These 3 components of the procedure are carried out simultaneously. Each subject will be evaluated pre- and post-treatment with several clinical tests of functional movement. The hypotheses of this project are that the AMES+rTMS and AMES+tDCS procedures are safe and will enable most of the stroke patients to recover finger extension.","detailedDescription":"This protocol is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a procedure for treating chronic (\\>1 year post) stroke patients who still cannot move the hand affected by the stroke. The treatment involves: (1) assisted hand movement by a mechanical device, (2) mechanical vibration applied to the surface of the forearm, and (3) stimulation of the brain with either transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcortical direct current stimulation (DCS). Subjects receiving TMS during treatment are expected to respond more fully (i.e., increased volitional EMG) in the treated hand compared to those receiving DCS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Plegia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Plegia","Upper Extremity","rTMS","tDCS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AMES therapy with rTMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Each subject will participate in 30 therapy sessions over a 10- to 15-week period.
