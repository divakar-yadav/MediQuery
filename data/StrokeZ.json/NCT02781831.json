It is anticipated that robot-assisted gait rehabilitation in combination with standard hospital based rehabilitation will achieve significantly better gait outcomes than standard hospital based rehabilitation alone.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in most developed countries world wide with one-third of the surviving patients from stroke fail to regain independent walking ability. Robot-assisted gait rehabilitation that is able to deliver high intensity and consistent repeatability in a safe and controlled environment are gaining traction and advocators for its inclusion as part of the routine post-stroke rehabilitation program. However, despite the recent technological advances in the development and design of better robotics, the exact benefit of the robot-assisted therapy over traditional rehabilitation remain sparse and unclear. It is therefore the aim of the proposed project to fulfil this important gap in our clinical knowledge by comparatively investigate the clinical feasibility and efficacy of a recently developed HIWIN Robotic Gait Training System (MRG-P100) against the traditional rehabilitation program with an emphasis on the determination of functional recovery and the appropriate gait adaptation of such robotic system for stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient with stroke receiving standard hospital based rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Procedure: Standard rehab"]},{"label":"Robot-assisted Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient with stroke receiving standard hospital based rehabilitation as well as robot-assisted gait rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Device: Robot-assisted gait rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Standard rehab","description":"Standard hospital based rehabilitation for patients with stroke","armGroupLabels":["Standard Rehabilitation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot-assisted gait rehabilitation","description":"An extra 30 minutes of robot-assisted gait rehabilitation after receiving standard hospital based rehabilitation for patients with stroke","armGroupLabels":["Robot-assisted Rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment, lower extremity subscale","description":"Lower limb function as measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment, lower extremity subscale","timeFrame":"Assessing change from baseline after 1 month of intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Categories","description":"Categorizes patients according to basic motor skills necessary for functional ambulation","timeFrame":"Assessing change from baseline after 1 month of intervention"},{"measure":"10 Meters Walking Test","description":"Assesses walking speed in meters per second over a short duration","timeFrame":"Assessing change from baseline after 1 month of intervention"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"testing a participant's static and dynamic balance abilities","timeFrame":"Assessing change from baseline after 1 month of intervention"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go test","description":"Assess a participant's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance","timeFrame":"Assessing change from baseline after 1 month of intervention"},{"measure":"Kinetic and Kinematic Gait Analysis","description":"The temporo-spatial and kinematic gait parameters of the participants will be assessed using a Vicon Motion Analysis System with kinetic data collection through a force plate.","timeFrame":"Assessing change from baseline after 1 month of intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
