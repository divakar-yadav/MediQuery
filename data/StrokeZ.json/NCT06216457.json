Consecutive \"Code Stroke\" screening NCCTs and CTAs will be processed with the Methinks technology. This is a prospective observational study, but no clinical decisions will be made based upon the Methinks results.\n\nThere are 3 Cohorts: Group 1, LVO; Group 2, ICH; Group 3 Controls.\n\nConsecutive Code Stroke subjects will be enrolled. Group 1 and Group 2 will be followed through Day 7 or Discharge, whichever is sooner. Group 3 will be followed only through the Code Stroke work-up. Only minimal demographics and clinical information will be collected, with all NCCT and CTA images processed with Methinks software collected.\n\nInformed consent forms (ICF) will be waived, as approved by the IRB."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke, Acute","Brain Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1: LVO","description":"Subjects with Methinks NCCT algorithm detecting ICA, M1, and M2 occlusions.","interventionNames":["Device: AI software for Stroke"]},{"label":"Group 2: ICH","description":"Subjects with Methinks NCCT algorithm detecting ICHs.","interventionNames":["Device: AI software for Stroke"]},{"label":"Group 3: Controls","description":"Subjects with final diagnosis confirmed not to be Stroke (i.e. stroke mimic) or any type of stroke not determined to be: LVO (ICA, M1 or M2) or ICH.","interventionNames":["Device: AI software for Stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"AI software for Stroke","description":"AI Software for Non-Contrast Head CT (Computed Tomography) and CT Angiography, utilized for Code Stroke screening, notification and triage.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1: LVO","Group 2: ICH","Group 3: Controls"],"otherNames":["Methinks AI Software"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the following Methinks AI modules:","description":"1.
