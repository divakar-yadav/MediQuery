Immunosuppression markers are associated with the occurrence of medical complications (infections), whereas inflammatory markers are associated with worse functional prognosis.\n\nThis prospective study tries to validate in acute stroke patients the prognostic usefulness of a panel of immune biomarkers that have previously been associated with various clinical outcomes. The immune biomarkers will be assessed at admission, at day 1 after admission and at day 90. The assessed immune biomarker panel includes:\n\n* Serum cortisol levels.\n* Serum interleukin (IL)-10 levels.\n* Proportion of circulating B lymphocytes (CD3-CD19+ cells).\n* Monocyte surface expression of TLR4, HLA-DR, CD86, and VLA-4.\n* Ex - vivo production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in monocytes after stimulation with LPS.\n* Proportion of each of the circulating monocyte subpopulations (CD14highCD16-, CD14highCD16+, and CD14dimCD16+).\n\nThe identification of beneficial and harmful immune responses in cerebral ischemia will allow the prediction of the clinical course of the patients and will be helpful in designing immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies for acute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","immune biomarkers","stroke-associated infection","functional outcome","prediction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Whole blood, serum and plasma."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":132,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke","description":"Patients with an ischemic stroke admitted within 6 hours of symptom onset, with a minimum severity in the NIHSS of 3 and treated with systemic or intraarterial thrombolysis"},{"label":"Healthy subjects","description":"Age-matched individuals free of acute neurological injury"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Predictive immune score for favorable outcome","description":"To establish a predictive immune score for functional outcome.
