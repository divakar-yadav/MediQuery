The study participants will also be randomly assigned the order to sleep either under normoxia or IH exposure. The experiments will be separated from one another with an interval of sufficient drug and IH exposure washout period. The venous blood samples and urinary samples will be collected for the vascular biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea of Adult","Hypoxia, Brain","Sleep Apnea","Sleep Disorder","Stroke","Blood Pressure","Endothelial Dysfunction","Oxidative Stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CBF Lowering and Normoxia Sleep","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Study participants will take drug lowering Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and sleep under room air i.e. normoxia exposure.","interventionNames":["Drug: Drug Lowering Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Normoxia Sleep"]},{"label":"CBF Lowering and IH Sleep","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study participants will take drug lowering Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and sleep under Intermittent Hypoxia (IH) exposure.","interventionNames":["Drug: Drug Lowering CBF and Intermittent Hypoxia Sleep"]},{"label":"Placebo and Normoxia Sleep","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Study participants will take Placebo that has no effect on Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and sleep under room air i.e. normoxia exposure.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo and Normoxia Sleep"]},{"label":"Placebo and IH Sleep","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Study participants will take Placebo that has no effect on Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and sleep under Intermittent Hypoxia (IH) exposure.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo and Intermittent Hypoxia Sleep"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Drug Lowering Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Normoxia Sleep","description":"The study participants will take Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) lowering drug and sleep under Normoxia Exposure","armGroupLabels":["CBF Lowering and Normoxia Sleep"],"otherNames":["Cerebral Blood Flow changes and Normoxia Sleep"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Drug Lowering CBF and Intermittent Hypoxia Sleep","description":"The study participants will take Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) lowering drug and sleep under Intermittent Hypoxia (IH) Exposure","armGroupLabels":["CBF Lowering and IH Sleep"],"otherNames":["CBF changes and Intermittent Hypoxia Sleep"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo and Normoxia Sleep","description":"The study participants will take Placebo and sleep under Normoxia Exposure","armGroupLabels":["Placebo and Normoxia Sleep"],"otherNames":["Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) with Placebo in Normoxia Sleep"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo and Intermittent Hypoxia Sleep","description":"The study participants will take Placebo and sleep under Intermittent Hypoxia (IH) Exposure","armGroupLabels":["Placebo and IH Sleep"],"otherNames":["CBF with Placebo in Intermittent Hypoxia Sleep"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in cerebral blood flow and ventilatory chemoreflexes","description":"The relationship between changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and ventilatory chemoreflexes (acute hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses) before and after sleeping under normoxia and intermittent hypoxia exposure among healthy human study participants.","timeFrame":"~18 months (from the starting time of recruiting study participants)"},{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow responses and ventilatory chemoreflexes during sleep","description":"The relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes and ventilatory chemoreflexes (acute hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses) during sleep under normoxia and intermittent hypoxia exposure among healthy human study participants.","timeFrame":"~18 months (from the starting time of recruiting study participants)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in reactive oxygen species and vascular biomarkers","description":"The changes in vascular biomarkers such as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species and exosome analysis or urinary prostaglandins before and after sleep under normoxia and intermittent hypoxia exposure with cerebral blood flow changes.","timeFrame":"~24 months (from the starting time of recruiting study participants)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy adults\n* 18 -
