Therapeutic agents are administered at intervals of 4.5 to 2 hours after onset of clinical signs. Overall administration of anticoagulant agents will test 72 hours.\n\nRandomized patients will be divided into three groups. The first group of patients will receive heparin intravenously at the beginning of 2500 UI bolus intravenously, followed by intravenous pump 1000 UI / h (18-20 IU / kg / hr) to reach 2-2.5 times the baseline aPTT. After 24 hours, patients will receive the group Nadroparin subcutaneously in the therapeutic dose.\n\nSecond group of patients will be administered subcutaneously Nadroparin the therapeutic dose as recommended.\n\nThe third group of patients are those who will receive placebo intravenously and 24 hours after receiving nadroparin subcutaneously in the therapeutic dose.\n\nAll patients will receive after 24 hours of starting treatment 100 mg of aspirin per orally.\n\nFor initiation of treatment will be assessed:\n\n* Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, inclusion, exclusion criteria\n* Sign the informed consent and patient randomization\n* Laboratory parameters: glucose, creatinine, GGT, K, Na, Cl, blood count, basic coagulation\n* Women of childbearing age (pregnancy test)\n* History, clinical presentation, medical history, basic internal review of the status (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, etc.).\n* Initial CT examination of the brain\n* EKG\n* USG sections of extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries\n* special hematology factors\n\nIf a patient meets all the necessary criteria, he may be given the test substance. During the first 24 hours will be monitored at regular intervals vital functions.\n\nAfter 24 hours, each patient received subcutaneous Nadroparin the therapeutic dose and also 100 mg of aspirin per orally.\n\nIn the interval from 24 to 30 hours of starting treatment the patient will be made:\n\n* Control CT brain\n* EKG\n* Basic coagulation\n* Reduction to stop treatment for newly identified haemorrhage or severe and extensive focal cerebral ischemia by CT scan\n* special hematology factors\n\n  72 hours, 7, 30 and 90 days after starting treatment, the patient's clinical evaluation using the Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Barthel Index.\n\nSafety endpoints: mortality, adverse side effects, bleeding"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Heparin","Nadroparin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Heparin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient receiving Heparin","interventionNames":["Drug: Heparin","Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Nadroparin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient receiving nadroparin","interventionNames":["Drug: Nadroparin","Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receiving placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Heparin","Drug: Nadroparin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Heparin","armGroupLabels":["Heparin","Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nadroparin","armGroupLabels":["Nadroparin","Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Heparin","Nadroparin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety of nadroparine or heparin","description":"Safety - incidence of intracranial hemorhage","timeFrame":"DAY 3,7,30,90"},{"measure":"Efficacy of nadroparine or heparin","description":"Efficacy -level of improvement measured by mRS, and NIHSS","timeFrame":"DAY 3,7, 30, 90"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ischemic stroke\n* female or male gender\n* mRS (modified Rankin Scale) 0-1 (min one month before the event)\n* NIHSS ≥ 6 and ≤ 25\n* Age: 18-80 years\n* initiation of therapy in the interval from 4.5 to 24 hours from onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke\n* focal neurological deficit of at least 30 min, which was significantly obviously does not disappear before treatment\n* patient will participate voluntarily and signed informed consent.
