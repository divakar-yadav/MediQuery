The current study aims to develop a novel, short-term, high-dose repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) based intervention to improve post-stroke cognitive problems. This study will test the safety as well as changes in cognitive function and brain activation with the administration of an accelerated rTMS protocol in chronic stroke.","detailedDescription":"The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether a repetitive high-dose form of non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising and safe treatment for stroke-related cognitive difficulties. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved treatment for depression, and is used commonly to treat people for their depression. In studies of rTMS for depression and other disorders, individuals have experienced improved cognitive function. Thus, we are testing here whether cognitive function in individuals with chronic stroke could be improved by rTMS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rTMS","cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"All participants would receive open-label treatment for approximately eight, 3-minute sessions of intermittent theta burst rTMS on each of three days within a seven-day span.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dose 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants would receive open-label treatment for approximately eight, 3-minute sessions of intermittent theta burst rTMS on each of three days within a seven-day span.
