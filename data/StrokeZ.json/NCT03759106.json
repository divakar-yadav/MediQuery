Importantly, loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors, with a significant long-term impact on activities of daily living, leisure activities and work. The capacity for recovery following a stroke depends on several factors, including the extent of the initial neurological damage, spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation, with possible recovery even years after the stroke. Unfortunately, accessibility of much needed rehabilitation services poststroke often remains limited, both in terms of intensity and duration, as reported in a recent report on post-stroke rehabilitation services in Quebec. Recent evidence suggests that homebased telerehabilitation (TR) is a viable approach for upper limb training post-stroke when rehabilitation services are not available. Similarly, the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care update for 2013 recommends home-based patient monitoring be used when frequent monitoring is needed and face-to-face visits are not available. Hence, the investigators have developed and propose to examine the use of the VirTele system for people who have suffered a stroke who are no longer receiving rehabilitation services The VirTele system allows upper limb rehabilitation using exergames with ongoing off-line monitoring combined with online monitoring and coaching based on the self-determination theory.","detailedDescription":"More specifically, the primary objective of the RCT is to provide preliminary evidence regarding efficacy of the VirTele program for upper limb motor control recovery in chronic stroke. Secondary objectives are to: i. Determine the effect of the VirTele program on upper limb function, quality of life and motivation; ii. Determine the feasibility of using the VirTele program with users at home (e.g. adherence, safety, technical difficulties, facilitators and barriers); iii. Explore the role that shared decision-making and empowerment play in exercise program adherence and progression, and in behavior modification for upper-limb use.\n\nThis study will also provide evidence of feasibility for conducting a larger-scale RCT comparing different technologies and interventions for chronic stroke rehabilitation.\n\nA single-blind (evaluator) two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed for this study with participants who have had a stroke randomly allocated to: (1) 8-week training with the VirTele system.i.e. treatment group or (2) 8-week written home exercise program provided by a clinician (GRASP), i.e. exercise control group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Virtual reality","telerehabilitation","Stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No Intervention: Usual care","type":"OTHER","description":"All study participants in the control group will receive an 8-week written home exercise program (e.g. GRASP) , i.e. the usual care discharge home program.","interventionNames":["Other: home written exercise program"]},{"label":"Experimental: Telerehabilitation system","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the experimental group will receive 8 weeks home exercise program using a virtual reality (VR) and telerehabilitation system.
