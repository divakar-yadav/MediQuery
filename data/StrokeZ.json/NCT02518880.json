In this context, cardiac output (CO) is a key value to estimate the human cardiovascular system.\n\nThe main objective of this experiment is to determine the effects of parabolic flight on intravascular volume, and how these changes modulate the complex haemodynamics induced by the parabolas."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy Volunteers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Plasma volume measurements","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: Parabolic flight","Other: plasma volume measurements"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Parabolic flight","armGroupLabels":["Plasma volume measurements"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"plasma volume measurements","armGroupLabels":["Plasma volume measurements"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"haemoglobin concentration","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* healthy volunteers (men or women),\n* aged from 18 to 55,\n* affiliated to a Social Security system,\n* who accept to take part in the study,\n* who have given their written stated consent,\n* who already participated in parabolic flights (even in the same campaign)\n* All subjects will pass a medical examination similar to a standard aviation medical examination for private pilot aptitude.
