The tCES has been applied in clinical trials related to rehabilitation research in recent years, and the safety and effectiveness have also been established. However,the existing tCES products effect on the whole brain networks and lack special waveforms. Therefore, we aim to develop a wearable tCES with high definition and special waveforms in this study. This novel stimulation system will result in more precise and focal stimulation of selected brain regions with special waveforms to display better neuromodulation performance. We expect that the novel high-definition tCES (HD-tCES) combined with the upper extremity rehabilitation can shorten the duration of rehabilitative periods, improve stroke patients' activity of daily living, reduce the care burden of patients' family, and subsequently decrease the cost of health care insurance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, Transcranial electrical stimulation, Upper-limb rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HD-tCES & upper extremity rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experiment group will receive HD-tCES combined with upper extremity rehabilitation of affected side.","interventionNames":["Device: HD-tCES","Other: Upper extremity rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Sham HD-tCES & upper extremity rehabilitation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham control group will receive sham HD-tCES combined with upper extremity rehabilitation of affected side.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham HD-tCES","Other: Upper extremity rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"HD-tCES","description":"The positions of the lesion side primary motor cortex were defined as C3/C4 according to the international 10-20 system of electroencephalograms.
