Group 2 of study participants will use the Manumeter but receive no feedback and will be given the current standard-of-care, a booklet describing a home exercise program for increasing upper extremity exercise. The investigators hypothesize that study participants who interactively monitor functional activity with the Manumeter will improve their upper extremity function significantly more."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Manumeter with interactive feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study participants will receive an experimental manumeter and interactive feedback from the manumeter to monitor and motivate their upper extremity functional activities.","interventionNames":["Device: Manumeter"]},{"label":"Manumeter without interactive feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study participants will receive an experimental manumeter but receive no feedback from the manumeter, and will be given the current standard-of-care for increasing upper extremity exercise booklet to perform at home.","interventionNames":["Device: Manumeter"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Manumeter","description":"A manumeter is a first-of-its-kind magnetic sensor to wirelessly detect hand and arm movement in a socially acceptable and easy to don package.
