This trial will provide critical mechanistic data to improve the understanding of placebo in stroke clinical trials, as to solve methodological and ethical dilemma in research designs, and to improve its clinical outcomes. It aims to investigate whether placebo in isolation (open and hidden) has a specific neural signature in stroke subjects. For this purpose, the investigators plan to recruit 56 chronic stroke participants, that will be randomized using blocked randomization in a 2:2:2:1 proportion to one of the following groups, respectively: 1) open placebo (OP) alone (16 subjects); 2) sham rTMS alone (16 subjects); 3) no intervention (16 subjects); or 4) active rTMS alone (8 subjects). All four groups will undergo 2 weeks of daily intervention visits (10 sessions)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["stroke","placebo"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active rTMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The participant will receive a session of low frequency rTMS to the contralesional primary motor cortex.
