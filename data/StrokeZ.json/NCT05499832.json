For this purpose, 156 adult participants experiencing an acute ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion with incomplete reperfusion with residual occlusions after MT will be randomly assigned to receive 3mg intra-arterial (IA) TNK or best medical treatment. Recruitment will occur at 20 academic tertiary stroke care centers in Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Germany and patients are followed up for 90 days after the index event. Showing superiority for reperfusion outcomes would have a major impact on the future management of stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":156,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Best Medical Treatment (standard of care)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients will receive standard of care as per current ESO guidelines."},{"label":"Intra-arterial Tenecteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive intra-arterial administration of Tenecteplase using a standard approved microcatheter.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Patients randomized to IA treatment will receive IA TNK via a standard approved microcatheter positioned as close as possible to the residual occlusion site or as distal as possible in the originating vessel if multiple residual occlusions exists.","armGroupLabels":["Intra-arterial Tenecteplase"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early reperfusion of the residual intracranial occlusion(s)","description":"Defined by reperfusion improvement on angiography images","timeFrame":"25 minutes after randomization"},{"measure":"Late reperfusion of the residual intracranial occlusion(s)","description":"Defined by complete reperfusion on perfusion imaging","timeFrame":"24 hours ±6 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Degree of disability or dependence assessed by the modified ranking scale (mRS) (shift analysis)","description":"mRS","timeFrame":"90 days+/-15 days"},{"measure":"Normalized change in National Institute of Health Score Scale (NIHSS)","description":"NIHSS","timeFrame":"24 hours +/- 6 hours post-randomization"},{"measure":"Change in National Institute of Health Score Scale (NIHSS)","description":"NIHSS","timeFrame":"90 days +/- 15 days post-randomization"},{"measure":"Quality of life as assessed by the EuroQol 5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L)","description":"EuroQol 5D-3L","timeFrame":"90 days +/- 15 days"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality","description":"Mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Informed consent\n* Age ≥18 years\n* Clinical signs consistent with an acute ischemic stroke\n* Patient had an initial large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation defined as intracranial ICA, M1 or M2.\n* Patient has undergone endovascular stroke treatment\n* Onset to randomization no later than \\< 345 minutes after symptom-onset/last-seen well.\n* Incomplete reperfusion defined as\n\n  1.
