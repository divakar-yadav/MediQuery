Secondary outcome parameters include quality of life and depression.","detailedDescription":"Neuropsychiatric consequences of brain ischemia play a critical role in shaping long-term stroke outcome. Unfortunately, however, as of now, clinical research and clinical practice have not adequately addressed this growing challenge. A good case in point is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms may increase the risk of cardiovascular events (Sumner et al., 2015). Moreover, unbeknownst to most clinical neurologists, a significant portion (approximately 25%) of their stroke patients develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within the first year post-event. PTSD-related symptoms after an acute coronary syndrome increase the risk of recurrent cardiac events and mortality (Edmondson et al., 2012). Similarly, stroke-induced PTSD has been linked with worse long term stroke outcome, in particular, recurrent stroke, greater disability, non-adherence to medications, and comorbidities (Goldfinger et al., 2014; Kronish et al., 2012).\n\nFor a period of 22 months, all stroke patients treated at the Charité Medical Center will be screened retrospectively 9-13 months after a first-ever ischemic stroke (\\~2000). All eligible patients will be contacted by mail 9-13 months after their hospital stay with the request that they complete the questionnaires. The mailing will also include an information statement, the consent form, as well as a stamped return envelope."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ptsd","stress","traumatization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":636,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Questionnaires","description":"Psychological questionnaires: BTQ, IES-R, 7-items-short Screening scale, BDI, SF-36"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke-induced PTSD","description":"Stroke-induced PTSD will be measured using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R).","timeFrame":"9-13 months after stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Trauma exposure","description":"Prior trauma exposure before the infarct is ascertained with the 10-item Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ).","timeFrame":"9-13 months after stroke"},{"measure":"Lifetime PTSD","description":"The occurrence of PTSD symptoms in the study subjects' lifetimes is assessed using the 7-item Short Screening Scale for DSM IV PTSD.","timeFrame":"9-13 months after stroke"},{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Functional outcome is measured with the SF-36","timeFrame":"9-13 months after stroke"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Depression","description":"depressive symptoms are assessed with the BDI (Beck's Depression Inventory)","timeFrame":"9-13 months after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n1.
