But warfarin has its disadvantages such as risk of bleeding and the requirement of frequent INR monitoring. The underuse of warfarin is a prominent problem in China. In our study, patients with cardioembolic stroke were treated with hirudin plus aspirin or warfarin. The aim of our study was to compare efficacy and safety of hirudin plus aspirin and warfarin in secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardioembolic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cardioembolic stroke","Hirudin","aspirin","warfarin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":239,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hirudin plus aspirin","description":"14 days after stroke onset, patients in the hirudin plus aspirin group received natural hirudin 0.75g, three times a day and aspirin 100mg, once daily.","interventionNames":["Drug: hirudin plus aspirin"]},{"label":"Warfarin","description":"14 days after stroke onset, patients in warfarin group were given an initial dose of 1.25mg of warfarin,once daily. 3 days later, INR of patients was checked every three days and the dose of warfarin was adjusted until reach the target range of 2 to 3.
