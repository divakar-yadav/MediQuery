The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.\n\nScores: With the component of upper extremity (max 4 scores), wrist (max 10 scores), passive joint motion (max 8 scores) and joint pain (max 8 scores), the total or maximum scores is the sum of all the component which is 30 and the minimum is 0. The score for a normal person is 30 scores. The higher the score indicates the better the condition of the subject.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Motor Assessment Scale (MAS)","description":"Introduction: Motor function that are related to wrist and forearm are measured using the Motor Assessment Scale. The Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) is a performance-based scale that was developed as a means of assessing everyday motor function in patients with stroke. In MAS, task 1 and 3 in the hand movement sub-component assessment were accessed (MAS-Hand), as the two task is the most related component to the tested movement.\n\nScore: The total or maximum scores is 2, and minimum scores is 0. In this scale, the higher the score indicates the better the condition of the subject. The score for a healthy person is 2.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Introduction: The spasticity level of wrist is measured by using Modified Ashworth Scale. It measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching. This measure will only measure the wrist component, as forearm component is not included in this scale.\n\nScoring: The total or maximum scores for the subscale is 4 and the minimum is 0 score. Higher scores indicates the higher the tone, lower score indicates less tone. 0 score indicates normal tone and no increase in tone, while 4 scores indicate affected part rigid in flexion or extension. All the scores will be summed.\n\nProcedure: The measuring procedure starts by holding the elbow as straight as possible at forearm pronated. Then, the patient's wrist is moved from maximum possible flexion to maximum possible extension. The test is performed up tp maximum of 3 times to avoid the influence of the effect of stretch.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Forearm's Active Range of Movement","description":"Forearm's active range of motion is a measurement to identify how far the person's joints range can move in pronation-supination by moving with their own effort.
