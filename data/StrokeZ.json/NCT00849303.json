Patients are randomized to receive intensive in-patient multiprofessional rehabilitation at different time points. One group will receive rehabilitation immediately after an acute care at the neurological clinic (8 days) and one group 5 weeks after the insult. Patients practise walking every workday for 60 min (actual 30min) either on a treadmill or on a gait trainer for four weeks, and receive also other physiotherapy. In addition to selected parameters measuring brain plasticity, detailed assessments of functional abilities including motor ability and quality of life will be performed. A novel tool, MR-image navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is utilized in assessing cortical excitability in relation to stroke, time, rehabilitation, and recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","gait","timing","transcranial magnetic
