Spasticity may be associated with pain and contractures, caused by muscle weakness, reduced muscle length and volume that add to the disability.Treatments of spasticity comprise physical therapy, pharmacological agents and surgical treatment. Recently, a systematic review concluded that transcutaneous, electric nerve stimulation may have beneficial effects on spasticity and activity performance after stroke, which lends support to the new treatment method Mollii, which will be evaluated in this study.The Mollii suit provides electric stimulation through multiple electrodes places in a tight fitting suit. This study relates to the clinical trials performed at the University department of rehabilitation medicine at Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm and comprises an initial study of effects on spasticity (\"Mechanical substudy\") and a following, exploratory treatment trial (\"Clinical substudy\") in patients with spasticity after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Spasticity is a common manifestation of lesions of central motor pathways, such as after stroke, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury and in cerebral palsy and is associated with increased impairments and disabilities. Spasticity may be associated with pain and contractures, caused by muscle weakness, reduced muscle length and volume that add to the disability.Treatments of spasticity comprise physical therapy, pharmacological agents and surgical treatment. Recently, a systematic review concluded that transcutaneous, electric nerve stimulation may have beneficial effects on spasticity and activity performance after stroke, which lends support to the new treatment method Mollii, which will be evaluated in this study.The Mollii method has been developed by Inervetions, which is a small Swedish med-tech company, and represents an innovative approach for non-invasive electro-stimulation to reduce spasticity and improve motor function. The theoretical background of this treatment method primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e. that sensory input from a muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle. Thus, the application of Mollii aims at stimulating a muscle, e.g. the anterior tibial muscle of the lower leg in order to reduce reflex mediated over-activity, i.e. spasticity, in calf muscles by inducing reciprocal inhibition."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity, Muscle","Stroke","Electric Stimulation Therapy"],"keywords":["Spasticity","Stroke","Functioning","Disability","Intervention","electrical stimulation therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Mechanism substudy: explorative single group design with three different stimulation paradigms provided to all participants by double blinded randomisation.\n\nClinical substudy: explorative single group design.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention in a Mechanism and a Clinical substudy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanism substudy: 3 trial sessions ( electrodes set to 1) 20 Hz, 2) 30 Hz, 3) 0 Hz (placebo).

The passive resistive force of the wrist or ankle is recorded by a force transducer. The force is then analyzed off-line and the total resistance is separated into mechanical and a neural components using a neuro-biomechanical computerized model. NeuroFlexor neural component reflecting stretch reflex mediated resistance, represents the main outcome. The NeuroFlexor hand (used in mechanism and clinical substudy) and foot module (used in mechansim substudy only) is a valid method that quantifies and distinguishes the genuine spasticity and the mechanical contributions (viscoelastic and soft tissue components) of the resistance opposing a passive stretch.","timeFrame":"Mechanism study: To assess change, NeuroFlexor data is recorded before, during and 10 minutes after treatment at each session.
