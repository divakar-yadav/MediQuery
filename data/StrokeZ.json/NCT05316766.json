After this, they will undergo a 12 sessions treatment for 4 weeks in groups of three, randomly distributed for a control group and experimental group. At the end of the intervention, participants will be assessed in the same manner as before the intervention. One month after the end of the intervention, participants will be assessed for follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Social Interaction","Self Efficacy","Stroke","Motor
