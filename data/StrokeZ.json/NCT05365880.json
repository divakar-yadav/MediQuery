Current literature lacks randomized controlled studies regarding the efficacy of different treatment modalities for acute post-stroke headache; additionally, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of acute post-stroke headache. Sphenopalatine ganglion block is a non-invasive procedure where an anesthetic agent is injected into the nares, reaching the SPG to relieve pain and autonomic features. This treatment has been effective in a variety of headache types but to our knowledge has not been studied in acute post-stroke headache."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Headache","Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Post-Stroke Headache","Sphenopalatine Ganglion (SPG) block"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Liquid Lidocaine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The investigational treatment is 1.5 mL of aqueous 2% lidocaine.","interventionNames":["Drug: Liquid Lidocaine"]},{"label":"Sham Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The placebo arm is 1.5mL of aqueous of saline.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Liquid Lidocaine","description":"The investigational treatment is 2 mL of aqueous 2% lidocaine.","armGroupLabels":["Liquid Lidocaine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"The active placebo comparator will be provided to participant.","armGroupLabels":["Sham Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Number of Migraine Headaches During Treatment Phase","description":"Evaluate the efficacy of Lidocaine delivered to SPG, based on the use of rescue medication and number of headache in headache diary","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numeric Pain Rating Scale","description":"The quantitative scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning \"no headache at all\" and 10 meaning \"the worst possible headache.\"","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Adverse effect","description":"Bitter taste, nose bleeding, throat discomfort","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18 years or older;\n2. hospitalization at the University of Utah Hospital with a diagnosis of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; confirmed acute post-stroke headache by treating physician;\n3. meets at least one of the following International Classification of Headache Disorder-3 (ICHD-3) criteria: 6.1.1.1 (Acute Headache Attributed to Ischemic Stroke), 6.2.1 (Headache attributed to non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage), 6.2.2 (Acute headache attributed to non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage); received at least one medication for headache during hospitalization.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
