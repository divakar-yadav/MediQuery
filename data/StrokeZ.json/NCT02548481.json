After a meeting, 13 multidisciplinary experts have discussed, adjusted and a new complete tool (BESTA) had been created in order to evaluate the different states of aphasia.\n\nThe goal of this study is the validation and the standardization of this new BESTA tool."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":395,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BESTA scale","description":"BESTA scale is administered at T0, T1 (3 months) and T2 (1 year)","interventionNames":["Other: BESTA scale"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"BESTA scale","description":"BESTA scale is administrated at T0, T1 and T2.","armGroupLabels":["BESTA scale"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"validity of concomitant criterion at T0 versus LAST","description":"T0: the gold standard was determined by the expert group is the LAST screening tool.\n\nThe tool to be evaluated is the BESTA at T0.
