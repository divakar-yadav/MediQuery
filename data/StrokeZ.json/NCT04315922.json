However clinical data on the gut-brain axis, and its chronic characteristics, is sparse. Additional investigations in the context of ischemic stroke regarding the relationship between dysbiosis and functional changes of the microbiome, as characterized by the metabolome, are still required. The StrokeMicroBiomics study will offer insight into these mechanisms and offer new potential targets for therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe primary objective is the characterisation of gut dysbiosis in ischemic stroke patients in the acute phase after stroke and during a 3 month follow-up period.\n\nThe secondary objectives include the identification of dysregulated gut microbiome metabolites and key immune cell populations in addition to the clinical progression of the study participants during the 3 month follow-up period after disease onset.","detailedDescription":"Results of experimental, preclinical studies suggest that microbiome-targeted may improve stroke outcome as well as stroke-related comorbidities. Yet, clinical trials describing the extent and time course of microbiome changes after stroke are currently not available. Moreover, the impact of post-stroke dysbiosis on metabolic changes and the systemic immunity are unexplored.\n\nTherefore, the primary objective of this trial is the characterization of gut dysbiosis progression in ischemic stroke patients during a 3 month follow-up period .\n\nThe secondary objectives include the identification of dysregulated gut microbiome metabolites and key immune cell populations in addition to the clinical progression of the study participants during the 3 month follow-up period after disease onset.\n\nIn order to elucidate the differential impact of lesion size on immune and microbiome homeostasis, separate patient cohorts with mild and severe stroke will be studied.\n\nFurthermore, to control for the effects of temporary focal neurological deficits and stress induced microbiome and immune changes, patients with stroke mimics and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are being recruited to the control group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
