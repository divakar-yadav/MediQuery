Clinical studies have demonstrated that the CI patients with DM had a poor prognosis compared with those without DM. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that patients with DM had abnormalities in cerebral vessels, nerves and functions, similar with the findings in mice models. In this study, with multi-modal MRI technologies, investigators tend to observe structural and functional changes of the brain in both DM and non-DM CI patients and assess their neural rehabilitation using clinical scales in the following 6 months. Investigators also expect to find out dynamic changes of brain structure and function, to reveal the weights of factors including brain blood vessels, nerves and function remodeling related with stroke recovery, as well as the potential mechanism in CI patients with DM."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke","Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["cerebral infarction","diabetes","rehabilitation","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diabetic stroke"},{"label":"Non-diabetic storke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (dead)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"National Institute of Health Stroke Score","description":"scores ranging from 0 to 42 (the higher the score, the greater the function deficits)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"score ranging from 0 (totally dependent) to 100 (completely independent)","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. ﬁrst-ever ischemic stroke;\n2. single infarct in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery;\n3. no evidence of hemorrhagic infarction;\n4. age greater than 18 years;\n5. admission between 3 and 7 days after stroke onset;\n6.
