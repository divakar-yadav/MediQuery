The secondary endpoint is the fall risk at one year.\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS: in the intervention group, a significant reduction in the number of total fall is expected, together with decreases indicators of utilization of acute health services because of falls. At three months, it is expected a significant improvement of functioning (motor functions, activity and participation) and health quality indicators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fall","Aging","Parkinson Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["Accidental falls","Clinical trial","Aged","Parkinson's Disease","Stroke","Exercise","Education"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":366,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Interdisciplinary interventions","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Multicomponent interventions\n\n* On-site supervised group exercise program (11 weeks)\n* Educational / behavioral sessions addressing specific behavioral and environmental risk factors for falls delivered by trained health professionals (11 sessions in total)\n* Home visits for suggestion and implementations of safety interventions aiming at reducing environmental hazards\n* Home-based exercise program: Personalized multi-factorial interventions: patients will have geriatric, neurology and physiatrist outpatient referrals to assess and treat individual risk factors.\n\nPersonalized multi-factorial interventions.
