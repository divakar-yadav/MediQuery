In fact, only 5% of adults regain full arm function after stroke, and 20% regain no functional use. Hence, alternative strategies are needed to reduce the long-term disability and functional impairment from upper limb hemiparesis.\n\nTo solve problems concerning upper limb dysfunction related to stroke, various treatment methods have been used in several previous studies. Rhythmic auditory stimulation has been reported as an effective intervention for improving movement in the affected extremities of stroke patients.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no mentioned previous studies evaluating the effect of rhythmic auditory cueing with bilateral arm training using functional exercises on upper extremity impairment in patients with stroke in Egypt are reported. So, this study aims to determine the effect of rhythmic auditory cueing with bilateral arm training on upper limb functions in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia, Spastic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rhythmic Auditory Cueing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group (B): Patients in this group will receive the same designed physical therapy program given to the control group in addition to auditory cueing during bilateral arm training using the metronome.","interventionNames":["Other: Rhythmic Auditory Cueing","Other: Bilateral arm training","Other: Conventional physical therapy program"]},{"label":"Bilateral arm training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this group will receive a standard physical therapy program in addition to Bilateral arm training.","interventionNames":["Other: Bilateral arm training","Other: Conventional physical therapy program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rhythmic Auditory Cueing","description":"Patients will perform the same movement sequence in time with the metronome beat.
