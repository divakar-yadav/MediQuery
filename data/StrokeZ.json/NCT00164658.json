The hypothesis to be tested is that patients who are provided with personalized prevention messages based on an assessment of their family history of disease will be more motivated to make behavior changes and use preventive health services than patients who do not have their family history assessed and who receive only generalized (not personalized) prevention messages. An additional hypothesis, tested when participants see their primary care physician during the study, is that providing a copy of the graphical family history, risk and prevention messages to the patient's physician will increase delivery of recommended preventive services (screening, referral, and health habit advice).\n\nThe study will consist of enrolling approximately 8360 patients aged 35-65 years who attend primary care practices that are part of research networks affiliated with the three research centers. The practices will be randomized into two groups. Patients in practices randomized to Group 1 will complete a pre-test and the family history tool, and will receive personalized prevention messages based on their level of familial risk and current risk behaviors. After six months, Group 1 patients will complete a post-test. Patients in Group 2 will complete the pre-test and receive standard prevention messages (appropriate for sex) about maintaining good health and preventing disease. After 6 months Group 2 patients will complete the post-test and the family history tool. The pre- and post-test will include assessment of risk factors, use of medical services (especially preventive services), interest in modifying health behaviors, risk perceptions, etc. The analysis will compare changes in health behaviors between patients in Groups 1 and 2 and will also examine differences by familial risk strata (average, moderate, high)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Heart Disease","Stroke","Diabetes","Breast Cancer","Ovarian Cancer","Colorectal Cancer"],"keywords":["family history","familial risk","behavior change"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Familial risk assessment and personalized prevention messages"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in stage of adoption of health behaviors and referral for additional screening and follow up for high risk participants at 6 month post evaluation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary care physicians' provision of preventive services in response to family medical history."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* member of participating primary care practice network\n* able to provide informed consent\n* able to complete data assessment tools in English\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosis of CHD, stroke, diabetes, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or colorectal cancer\n* currently pregnant\n* evidence of cognitive impairment","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Louise S Acheson, MD, MS","affiliation":"Case Western Reserve University Department of Family Medicine & CWRU/UHC Comprehensive Cancer Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Wendy S Rubinstein, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Suzanne M O'Neill, MA, MS, PhD","affiliation":"Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Mack T Ruffin IV, MD, MPH","affiliation":"University of Michigan","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Evanston Northwestern Healthcare (ENH) internal medicine, family practice, and OB/GYN practices","city":"Evanston","state":"Illinois","zip":"60201","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.04114,"lon":-87.69006}},{"facility":"American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network (AAFP-NRN).","city":"Leawood","state":"Kansas","zip":"66211","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.96667,"lon":-94.6169}},{"facility":"Great Lakes Research into Practice Network (GRIN)","city":"Ann Arbor","state":"Michigan","zip":"48109","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.27756,"lon":-83.74088}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25901453","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wang C, Sen A, Plegue M, Ruffin MT 4th, O'Neill SM, Rubinstein WS, Acheson LS; Family Healthware Impact Trial (FHITr) Group; Family Healthware Impact Trial FHITr Group.
