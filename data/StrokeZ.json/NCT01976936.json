The primary outcome of this Phase 2 study will be musculoskeletal and hepatic toxicity, defined by clinical and laboratory criteria, with a 3-month follow-up period (Â± 1 week). Secondary outcomes will include neurological outcome (National Institute of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale), functional outcomes (Barthel Index), and handicap (modified Rankin scores). Effects on inflammatory markers and lipid levels will also be assessed.","detailedDescription":"This is a phase 2 randomized, blinded and controlled safety study in patients with ischemic stroke. The time window for enrollment will be within 0-24 hours of symptom onset. For patients who are found with the stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke occurred the last time that the patient was known to be normal. All patients will be identified by the stroke acute care team in the emergency room of the participating centers, or in some cases, on the floor services of the hospital (i.e., for patients with stroke occurring in hospital). If preliminary data indicate that the patient meets eligibility criteria the patient (or legally authorized representative) will be approached about participation in the study, and consent obtained. Surrogate consent will be allowed at centers at which this is permitted according to regulations. Patients who are consented through a surrogate and subsequently regain capacity, will be approached and reconsented to continue in the study.\n\nThe intervention chosen for this trial is either (1) placebo for patients not taking a statin at the time of admission OR lovastatin 80 mg in place of their regular statin for patients taking a statin (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin) at time of enrolment VERSUS (2) oral lovastatin at dosage of 640 mg daily for 3 days. The time of first dose will be considered time 0. Patients will be administered the total daily dose in four daily divided doses (i.e., QID schedule). After the initial 3 days of acute dosage, all patients will receive statin therapy at the discretion of their treating physician."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rhabdomyolysis","Jaundice"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rhabdomyolysis","Jaundice"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":164,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Dose Lovastatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High dose lovastatin (640 mg daily for three days) will be administered orally","interventionNames":["Drug: High Dose Lovastatin"]},{"label":"Low Dose Lovastatin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Lovastatin 80 mg daily for three days will be administered orally to patients who were taking statin therapy at the time of enrolment","interventionNames":["Drug: Low Dose Lovastatin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo will be administered orally to patients who were NOT taking statin therapy at the time of enrolment","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Low Dose Lovastatin","description":"80 mg daily for 3 days","armGroupLabels":["Low Dose Lovastatin"],"otherNames":["Mevacor"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo for 3 days","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["microcrystalline cellulose"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"High Dose Lovastatin","description":"640 mg daily for 3 days","armGroupLabels":["High Dose Lovastatin"],"otherNames":["Mevacor"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Increase in Liver Function Tests (LFTs)","description":"Primary safety outcome: the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of major hepatic toxicity within 7 days of treatment onset or the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of rhabdomyolysis within 7 days of treatment onset.\n\nThe primary safety outcome will be defined as:\n\nLiver toxicity: LFT increase at any time point \\> 3X upper limit of normal or development of jaundice, otherwise unexplained coagulopathy, or other clinical evidence of hepatitis or liver failure;\n\nor\n\nMuscle toxicity: An increase in CK (Creatine Kinase) at any time point \\> 10 X upper limit of normal, or clinical evidence of muscle pain or weakness not related to the stroke and associated with CK \\> 5 X upper limit of normal.","timeFrame":"90 Days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Score on NIH Stroke Scale","description":"Measure of neurological outcomes.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Barthel Index Score","description":"Measure of functional outcomes.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin scores","description":"Measure of handicap.","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
