arm, post-approval study enrolling the following study population:\n\n* Subjects with neurological symptoms and \\>= 50% stenosis of the common or internal carotid artery by ultrasound or angiogram (visual estimate), or\n* Subjects without neurological symptoms and \\>= 80% stenosis of the common or internal carotid artery by ultrasound or angiogram (visual estimate)\n* The endpoint for the 1500 subjects enrolled will be a 30-day composite of death, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI).\n* For the 500 subjects with 12 month follow-up, the endpoint will be a composite of stroke, death and MI at 30 days and ipsilateral stroke at 12 months (31-365 days)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Disease","Carotid Stenosis","Stroke","Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["Carotid
