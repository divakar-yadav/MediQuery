This 5 years follow-up study will focus on serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms in Chinese population and its correlation to these diseases.","detailedDescription":"Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes, anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. Since its 1995 discovery, Ad has garnered considerable attention for its role in diabetic and cardiovascular pathology. Clinical observations have demonstrated the association of hypoadiponectinemia in patients with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. There is growing evidence supporting Ad can act as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injury. This 5 years follow-up study will focus on serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms in Chinese population and its correlation to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["adiponectin","cardiovascular diseases","cerebrovascular diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"NONE_RETAINED","description":"blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"volunteer"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with major adverse events","description":"Major adverse events included but were not limited to death during the study caused by cardiovascular events or cerebrovascular events.","timeFrame":"5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"blood routine, glucose and lipid profile; ECG;","description":"the tests mentioned above will be taken once per year","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms","description":"serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms will be monitored once per year.","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* available for 5 years of follow-up study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Death caused other than cardiovascular and cerebralvascular diseases till the study ends\n* Floating Population\n* Pregnancy, lactation, or child bearing women\n* Tumor\n* Active hepatic disease or hepatic dysfunction, or AST/ALT \\> 1.5UNL\n* Severe renal dysfunction(Scr \\> 3 mg/dl or 264Î¼mol/L)\n* Patients with any condition which, in the investigator's judgment, might increase the risk to the subject for any adverse event or abnormal laboratory finding","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"volunteer","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ling Tao, M.D Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86-15002955798","email":"lingtao2006@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Xijing Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Xi'an","state":"Shaanxi","zip":"710032","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Ling Tao, M.D Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86-15002955798","email":"lingtao2006@gmail.com"},{"name":"Ling Tao, M.D Ph.D","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":34.25833,"lon":108.92861}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31182031","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Gao C, Zhao S, Lian K, Mi B, Si R, Tan Z, Fu F, Wang S, Wang R, Ma X, Tao L.
