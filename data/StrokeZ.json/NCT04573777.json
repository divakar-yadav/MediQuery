Those trials (FOURIER and ODYSSEY) enrolled almost 50,000 patients and showed that PCSK9 inhibition therapy is safe and effective. The investigators hypothesize that PCSK9 inhibition lowers the rate of stroke by reducing atherosclerotic plaque, which would be particularly beneficial for patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, who have the highest rate of recurrent stroke of any stroke mechanism."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Intracranial
