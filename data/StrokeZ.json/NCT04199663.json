Associations between Socioeconomic Status (SES) and secondary preventive actions (SPAs) throughout the first year is studied and assessed as possible mechanisms underlying the increased risk of a first recurrent hard cardiocvascular (CV) outcome, recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (rASCVD), in patients with low Socioeconomic Status during long-term follow-up (2006-2018)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Socioeconomic Status","Secondary Prevention","Myocardial Infarction","Cardiovascular
