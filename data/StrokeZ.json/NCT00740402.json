Inclusion criteria: chronic stroke, single stroke event, lesion in anterior circulation, right handed subjects, MEEM over 23 points. The task consisted in a maze paradigm, made by pencil and paper, with the non affected side for EG and left upper extremity for CG. The instruction was given to the subjects to complete the task as fast as possible. The study consisted in three phases: acquisition (AQ)with 30 trials, transfer (TR, short retention (R1)and long term retention (R2 both with 5 trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"NONE_RETAINED","description":"no biospecimens are to be retained"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TIME","description":"time (in seconds)","timeFrame":"3 times in a week (acquisition, transfer an retention phase)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"error","description":"number of mistakes made by the subjects","timeFrame":"3 times in a week (acquisition, transfer an retention phase)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age between 40 and 65\n* Injury in territory of movement earlier, as shown by examination of image and finding medical neurologist\n* Time of injury over 6 months\n* Single vascular event\n* Right handed, by applying the Inventory of Dominance Side of Edinburgh Mini mental with scores over 23 points\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aphasia of understanding\n* Instability clinic\n* Other neurological diseases associated (Parkinson's disease, dementias, Alzheimer)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients after stroke","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Camila Torriani, doctor","affiliation":"University of Sao Paulo","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Center of Metropolitan United","city":"SÃ£o Paulo","country":"Brazil","geoPoint":{"lat":-23.5475,"lon":-46.63611}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
