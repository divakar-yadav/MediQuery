They will arrive to our lab four or six times. They will perform VO2 test and heat tolerance test (HTT) in different conditions.","detailedDescription":"16 healthy young male volunteers will participate in the study, 8 smokers and 8 non-smokers. They will arrive to our lab four or five times. During their first visit they will go through a VO2 max test in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness, and their physiological efficiency. During their second visit all subjects will go through the same test after exposure to nicotine. During the smokers' third visit they will go through the same test, after exposure to cigarette smoking. During the non-smokers third visit and the smokers fourth visit - they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test without prior smoking. During the fifth visit the smokers will go through an exercise heat tolerance test after exposure to cigarette smoking. During the smokers' sixth visit and the non-smokers fourth visit they will go through an HTT after exposure to nicotine."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cigarette Smoking"],"keywords":["smoking","exercise","heat tolerance","heat stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"smokers","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This arm consists of smokers.","interventionNames":["Drug: Nicotine","Other: cigarette smoking"]},{"label":"non-smokers","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"non-smoking participants in the study","interventionNames":["Drug: Nicotine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nicotine","description":"both groups will be given nicotine lozenges before a VO2 test and a HTT.","armGroupLabels":["non-smokers","smokers"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"cigarette smoking","description":"the smokers will smoke 2 cigarettes before a VO2 exam and a HTT.","armGroupLabels":["smokers"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Heat tolerance","description":"The test is performed in a climatic chamber at a temperature of 40oC and 40% relative humidity.
