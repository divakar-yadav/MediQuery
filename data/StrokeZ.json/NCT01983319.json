Furthermore the purpose is to highlight changes in GABA activity more than 3 months after stroke and its importance for effect of tDCS and CIMT combined with tDCS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CIMT + active anodal tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects in this group will be trained with constraint-induced movement therapy for the hand (10 consecutive sessions Monday- Friday) while concurrently receiving active anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation 1,5 mA for 30 min.","interventionNames":["Device: active anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)","Behavioral: Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)"]},{"label":"CIMT + sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects in this group will be trained with constraint-induced movement therapy for the hand (10 consecutive sessions Monday- Friday) while concurrently receiving sham transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: sham transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Behavioral: Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)"]},{"label":"Healthy control subjects","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"20 healthy age-matched control subjects will undergo MRI spectroscopy of the brain."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)","description":"Anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation 1.5 mA in 30 minutes with CIMT","armGroupLabels":["CIMT + active anodal tDCS"],"otherNames":["tDCS","Non invasive brain stimulation","transcranial stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","description":"sham transcranial Direct Current Stimulation 30 min with CIMT","armGroupLabels":["CIMT + sham tDCS"],"otherNames":["placebo stimulation"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)","description":"2 weeks of CIMT","armGroupLabels":["CIMT + active anodal tDCS","CIMT + sham tDCS"],"otherNames":["CIMT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Upper Limb function","description":"The motor function assessment will be done with: Wolf Motor Function Test","timeFrame":"Baseline and posttest (an average of 2 weeks from baseline)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) activity","description":"Assessment of GABA activity using MRI spectroscopy.
