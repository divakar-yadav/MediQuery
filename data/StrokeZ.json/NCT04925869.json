In Cayenne, in the absence of a NU, strokes are managed directly in the emergency room by 24-hour telemedicine provided by the neurovascular team at the Besançon University Hospital. The vascular neurologist can perform a clinical examination remotely in a dedicated examination room and has access to magnetic resonance imaging by image transfer. The Tours and Besançon university hospitals each have a regional reference NU. The coordinating investigator of the study is the head of the neurology department of the Tours University Hospital, currently on an extended mission in Cayenne. The initial emergency management of a person with stroke who is hospitalized is comparable between the three regions studied.\n\nEpidemiological studies show disparities in stroke mortality and vascular risk factors between French regions. The stroke mortality rate in French Guiana in 2013 (72 per 100 000 population per year) was twice that of metropolitan France. The standardized prevalence rate of diabetes in French Guiana is 7.1% of the population compared with 4.4% in metropolitan France, and the prevalence of hypertension is twice as high among women in the French Guiana West Indies compared with metropolitan France. There are twice as many obese persons (BMI\\>30) in Guyanese women compared with metropolitan France.\n\nWe propose a prospective observational study based on the following hypothesis:\n\nThe average age of stroke occurrence, its type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), the vascular territories involved, the vascular risk factors, and the pre-hospital and intra-hospital management times will be superimposable between two metropolitan regions but different in French Guyana."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The hospitals of Besançon","description":"Adult patients with MRI-confirmed CVA admitted to the hospitals of Besançon","interventionNames":["Other: Observational study"]},{"label":"the hospitals of Cayenne","description":"Adult patients with MRI-confirmed CVA admitted to the hospitals of Cayenne.","interventionNames":["Other: Observational study"]},{"label":"the hospitals of Tours","description":"Adult patients with MRI-confirmed CVA admitted to the hospitals of Tours.","interventionNames":["Other: Observational study"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Observational study","description":"Observational study","armGroupLabels":["The hospitals of Besançon","the hospitals of Cayenne","the hospitals of Tours"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Describe the types of CVA and assess their risk factors on clinical, radiological and biological evidence","description":"Clinical assessment of stroke (NIHSS score) and systematic collection of vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, emboligic heart disease) Suspected mechanism (TOAST).
