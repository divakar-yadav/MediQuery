It is direct by Dr. Stephanie DeLuca and based on the principles surrounding ACQUIREc Therapy.\n\nACQUIREc Therapy is an evidenced-based approach to pediatric constraint-induced movement therapy, which refers to a multi-component form of therapy that is focused on helping children who have asymmetric motor abilities between the two sides of the body. Historically, ACQUIREc Therapy has the unimpaired or less impaired upper extremity constrained (by a cast or a splint) while also receiving active therapy from a specially trained therapist who shapes new skills and functional activities with the child's more impaired upper extremity but who is also a licensed Occupational or Physical Therapist (OT/PT). Therapy dosages are high much higher than tradition OT or PT - often lasting many hours per day, up to 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 2-4 weeks.\n\nInvestigators have developed further treatments based on the same principles of intensive services combined with behavior shaping for other areas of the body that are also affected by weakness (e.g., the leg and trunk) also, but which usually do not involve constraint. These have been more generally labeled ACQUIRE Therapy.\n\nAll forms involve intensive, play-based therapy for children with asymmetric motor impairments of the arms and hands. The primary focus of treatment is to facilitate the acquisition of new motor skills in the child's weaker body parts through high levels of intensive therapy using scientifically-based behavioral guidelines. Therapy is also delivered in naturalistic environments.\n\nACQUIREc Therapy as a treatment method has been tested in two randomized controlled trials, and a specific manual for its implementation has been developed. Dr. (s) Ramey and DeLuca previously founded a similar clinic, The Pediatric Neuromotor Research Clinic, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham where Dr. DeLuca directed the research clinic for 13 years and oversaw the implementation of the ACQUIREc Therapy treatment protocol in more than 400 cases.\n\nThis research will involve analyzing and interpreting the clinical data of children going through clinical procedures at the FBRI VTC Neuromotor Research Clinic. All participation is voluntary and no children will denied services if families choose not to participate."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neuromotor Impairments","Cerebral Palsy","Microcephaly","Autism","Trauma, Brain","Acquired Brain Injury","Pediatric Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Children and Adults with Cerebral Palsy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ACQUIRE Therapy"]},{"label":"Children and Adults with Microcephaly","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ACQUIRE Therapy"]},{"label":"Children and Adults with other Neuromotor Impairments","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ACQUIRE Therapy"]},{"label":"Children who have had a stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ACQUIRE Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"ACQUIRE Therapy","description":"Intensive therapy services combined with operant conditioning during treatment delivered by trained OT or PTs","armGroupLabels":["Children and Adults with Cerebral Palsy","Children and Adults with Microcephaly","Children and Adults with other Neuromotor Impairments","Children who have had a stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Emerging Behaviors Scale","description":"This is a measure of the number of skills a child uses from a set of 31 typical used on a daily basis","timeFrame":"up to 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assisting Hand Assessment","description":"This is a measure of bimanual arm and hand use","timeFrame":"Within 1 week prior to treatment and Within 1 week after treatment"},{"measure":"Pediatric Motor Activity Log","description":"This is a parental report about a child's ability to use an impaired arm and hand on a daily basis","timeFrame":"Within 1 week prior to treatment and Within 1 week after treatment"},{"measure":"Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2","description":"This is a measure of a child's motor abilities in comparison to typical development","timeFrame":"Within 1 week prior to treatment and Within 1 week after treatment"},{"measure":"The Bayley Motor Scales of Infant Development -III","description":"This is a measure of a infants's motor abilities in comparison to typical development","timeFrame":"Within 1 week prior to treatment and Within 1 week after treatment"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Video Assessments","description":"Videos of play and therapy sessions","timeFrame":"Within 1 week prior to treatment, during treatment, and Within 1 week after treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neuromotor Impairment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* fragile health","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"3 Months","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Individuals with neuromotor impairment who want to try and gain motor skills and function","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Stephanie DeLuca, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"540-526-2098","email":"stephdeluca@vt.edu"},{"name":"Laura Bateman","role":"CONTACT","phone":"540-526-2033","email":"laurapb2@vtc.vt.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Stephanie DeLuca, PhD","affiliation":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Fralin Biomedical Research Institute - VTC","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Roanoke","state":"Virginia","zip":"24016","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Stephanie DeLuca, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"540-526-2098","email":"stephdeluca@vt.edu"},{"name":"Laura Bateman","role":"CONTACT","phone":"540-526-2033","email":"Laurapb2@vtc.vt.edu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.27097,"lon":-79.94143}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29258560","type":"DERIVED","citation":"DeLuca SC, Wallace DA, Trucks MR, Mukherjee K.
