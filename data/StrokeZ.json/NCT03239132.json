The hypothesis is that the breath-based meditation will lead to decreases in the severity of symptoms of PSD, post-stroke anxiety (PSA), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and decreases in plasma IL-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines post-intervention in stroke survivors with PSD and their informal caregivers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":71,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Breath-based meditation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will receive 4 group sessions of breath-based meditation over 4 weeks, as well as meditation educational materials.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Breath-based meditation","Behavioral: Meditation educational materials"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control will receive meditation educational materials.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Meditation educational materials"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Breath-based meditation","description":"The experimental group will receive 4 group sessions of breath-based meditation over 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Breath-based meditation"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Meditation educational materials","description":"Meditation educational materials","armGroupLabels":["Breath-based meditation","Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by number screened per week","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by proportion of those eligible who enroll to the study","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by number of participants who completed the study","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by number of participants who adhered to the protocol","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by number of participants who completed all study assessments","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Post-Stroke Depression as assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D-R 10)","timeFrame":"baseline, immediately after intervention ends, 4 weeks after intervention ends, 8 weeks after intervention ends"},{"measure":"Post-Stroke Anxiety as assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-AD)","timeFrame":"baseline, immediately after intervention ends, 4 weeks after intervention ends, 8 weeks after intervention ends"},{"measure":"Levels of plasma IL-1 family pro-inflammatory cytokines","timeFrame":"baseline, immediately after intervention ends, 4 weeks after intervention ends, 8 weeks after intervention ends"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke survivors will be included if they speak English, can provide written informed consent, have a history of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic, or transient ischemic attack within the past 8 weeks, have a Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) total score of 16 or greater suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms, and currently live at home.\n* Informal caregivers will be included if they are speak English, can provide written informed consent, and self-identify as a first-time informal caregiver of a stroke survivor. -\n* To reflect standard practice, stroke survivors and their informal caregivers will be eligible to participate in the study regardless of whether they are currently receiving anti-depressant medications; however, the dose must have been stable for at least one month prior to recruitment into the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke survivors will be excluded if they currently reside outside of the home (e.g., rehabilitation center).\n* Stroke survivors and their informal caregivers will be excluded if they have severe cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cutoff score of 20), active psychosis, or bipolar disorder; if they currently abuse substances; or if they are acutely suicidal.
