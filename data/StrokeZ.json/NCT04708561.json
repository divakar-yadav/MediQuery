The main objective is to examine whether the therapy improves understanding of the stories worked on in the sessions. We also explore whether the observed progress is maintained one month after the end of treatment and whether it is generalized to neuropsychological tests, video material, and the participants' daily lives.\n\nThis therapy will be administered to four individuals with brain lesions, for six weeks, at the rate of two weekly sessions of one hour."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Right Hemispheric Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Brain-injured participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speech and language therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Speech and language therapy","description":"The intervention focuses on understanding the thoughts of the characters.

At the end of each story, the participant should explain what the characters want to mean by their statement.\n\nTo help the participant in his understanding of the character's intention, he will be asked:\n\n1) To mention as many intentions as possible that can be associated with the target statement presented out of context (eg: \"it's hot here\" that can be interpreted literally, ironically, as a lie or a request) and to imagine contexts in connection with interpretation; 2. Analyze the relevant elements of the context (environment, the relationship between the characters, knowledge of the characters); 3.
