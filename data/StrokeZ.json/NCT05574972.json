Patients with carotid artery stenosis will be assigned to either the Timing Carotid Stent or Carotid Wallstent. Each treated patient will be followed and assessed for 12 months after randomization. The hypothesis to be tested is that the safety and effectiveness of the Timing Carotid Stent is not inferior to the Carotid Wallstent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Carotid Artery Stenosis","Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":178,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Timing Carotid Stent","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Timing Carotid Stent"]},{"label":"Carotid Wallstent","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Carotid Wallstent"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Timing Carotid Stent","description":"all the participants in this group will be performed with Timing Carotid Stent","armGroupLabels":["Timing Carotid Stent"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Carotid Wallstent","description":"all the participants in this group will be performed with Carotid Wallstent","armGroupLabels":["Carotid Wallstent"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Experienced Major Adverse Events (MAE) at 30 days","description":"MAE defined as any death, stroke, or myocardial infarction through 30 days post-index procedure","timeFrame":"30 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Stent Technical Success","description":"Stent Technical Success defined as successful implantation of a Carotid Stent","timeFrame":"Procedural"},{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Procedure Success","description":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Procedure Success","timeFrame":"Procedural"},{"measure":"Target Lesion Revascularization","description":"Any clinically driven revascularization procedure that is performed to increase the luminal diameter inside or within 5 mm of the previously treated lesion","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"In-Stent Restenosis","description":"≥50% diameter stenosis within the stented lesion or within 5 mm proximal or distal to the stent at follow-up evaluation","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Ipsilateral ischemic stroke","description":"Any ipsilateral ischemic stroke through 1 year post-index procedure","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"mRS score change","description":"mRS score change through 1 year post-index procedure","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
