Aim of present study is to explore whether the combination of these two approaches might enhance their positive effects on motor recovery. Safety and efficacy of this combination will be assessed within a proof-of-principle, double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) will be delivered at left ear, in order to improve the response to the following robot-assisted therapy. Patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic chronic stroke will be randomized to robot-assisted therapy associated with real or sham tVNS, delivered for 10 working days. Change in Fugl-Meyer has been chosen as primary outcome, while changes in several quantitative indicators of motor performance extracted by the robot as secondary outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","hemorrhagic chronic","non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation","robot-assisted rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic therapy and real tVNS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group receives REAL vagus nerve stimulation during robotic rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation"]},{"label":"Robotic therapy and sham tVNS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group receives SHAM VNS during robotic rehabilitation.
