An Early and appropriate charging anyone with stroke is essential to reduce mortality, reduce dependency and promote recovery of autonomy. Intravenous fibrinolysis in patients with cerebral infarction (NINDS 1995), is reserved for a small proportion of highly selected patients. It therefore remains a significant therapeutic challenge, especially for patients with against-indications to fibrinolysis or in whom there is no immediate benefit. For twenty years of mechanical devices have been developed to remove, as quickly as possible, the cause of intracranial arterial occlusion and allow restoration of blood flow before brain damage is irreversible.\n\nNTF The protocol is part of the evaluation process of our clinical practices recommended by the National Health Authority (HAS), in the specific context of mechanical thrombectomy performed in French centers of interventional neuroradiology working with neurovascular units (A V)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Artery
