Physicians from 24 hospitals in Beijing underwent a standard secondary prevention training of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases by professional training, instruction manuals, stratification management software. In order to improve the persistence of taking preventive secondary medicine, IS patients from these 24 hospitals received healthy education through manuals and Digital Video Disc about health education during hospitalization and acquired secondary preventive knowledge of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases through regular health education messages during 6 months after discharge. Patients with IS from other 6 hospitals were used as a control, and no such intervention was given to them.\n\nTelephone follow-up was performed at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the onset of cerebral infarction, during which the use of antiplatelet and statins drugs and recurrence of IS were recorded. Patients who took antiplatelet drugs or statins at three follow-ups were regarded as persistent antiplatelet drugs or statins taking within one year after the onset of the disease. The main prognostic indicator was the recurrence of IS and persistence of antiplatelet and statins medication within 1 year, and the main purpose was to explore the impact of persistent statins and antiplatelet medication use on IS recurrence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Medication Persistence"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","Medication Persistence","outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3111,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"multiple health education interventions","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The group will receive health education manuals and Digital Video Disc (DVD) during hospitalization and regular text message during 1 year after discharge.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: multiple health education interventions"]},{"label":"conventional health education","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The second group will receive conventional health education during hospitalization except health education manuals, text message and Digital Video Disc (DVD)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: multiple health education interventions"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"multiple health education interventions","armGroupLabels":["conventional health education","multiple health education interventions"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients who continued taking antiplatelet drugs at three months after stroke onset, and proportion of patients who continued taking statins drugs at three months after stroke onset.","description":"Medication persistence at 3 months.
