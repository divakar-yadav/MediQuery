Stroke patients with apraxia will either receive a real stimulation or a sham stimulation (placebo) for 10 minutes at a time on 5 consecutive days during their in-patient stay in a rehabilitation center. Additionally, motor tasks are performed before and after the stimulation. The effect of the weak current stimulation on motor function is assessed 3-4 days after the last stimulation and 3 months after enrollment.","detailedDescription":"Despite the high incidence of the motor cognitive deficit apraxia after left-hemispheric stroke, evidence-based therapies do not exist. This randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) investigates whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an add-on therapy during neuro-rehabilitation can ameliorate apraxic deficits in patients with left hemisphere stroke. Therefore, anodal tDCS is applied over the parietal cortex of the left, lesioned hemisphere with an intensity of 2 mA for 10 minutes at a time on 5 consecutive days in combination with motor tasks before and after the stimulation. The effect of the stimulation is compared to a sham stimulation. Moreover, application of a pre-programmed study mode ensures a double-blind study design (patient and investigator). The performance in the apraxia test KAS (Cologne Apraxia Screening) 3-4 days after the last stimulation, compared to baseline, serves as primary endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints are evaluated using various apraxia tests, motor tests and neuropsychological tests 3-4 days after the last stimulation and 3 months after enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Apraxia"],"keywords":["tDCS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":117,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anodal tDCS at an intensity of 2 mA is applied for 10 minutes at a time on 5 consecutive days.
