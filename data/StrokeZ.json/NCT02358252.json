To earlier predict patients occurring dizziness during the tilt table test, this study utilized a self-developed integrated intelligent biosensor system to assist clinical staff efficiently and immediately assessing stroke patients with orthostatic hypotension. Further purposes were to survey the relationship between the orthostatic hypotension and heart rate variability (HRV) and find the predicted models of orthostatic hypotension."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Heart Rate Variability","orthostatic hypotension","stroke","integrated intelligent biosensor system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Orthostatic hypotension","description":"Collection of information of body mass index, modified Ashworth scale, maximal voluntary contraction(MVC), heart rate variability(HRV).\n\nTilt table test was used in this study to identify if the subjects with or without orthostatic hypotension."},{"label":"Non-orthostatic hypotension","description":"Collection of information of body mass index, modified Ashworth scale, maximal voluntary contraction(MVC), heart rate variability(HRV) Tilt table test was used in this study to identify if the subjects with or without orthostatic hypotension."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)","description":"measure subject's HRV, every 3 mins during the Tilt table test","timeFrame":"Baseline: before Tilt table test, resting position, measure HRV with 3 minutes interval, totally 7 HRVs were measured"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are first time to get stroke.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* unstable physiological conditions, serious joint spasticity, use cortisol or calming drugs, other neurological diseases","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"stroke patients","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"TaSen Wei","affiliation":"Changhua Christian Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Changhua Christian Hospital","city":"Changhua","zip":"500","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":24.07327,"lon":120.56276}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000007024","term":"Hypotension, Orthostatic"},{"id":"D000007022","term":"Hypotension"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000054971","term":"Orthostatic Intolerance"},{"id":"D000054969","term":"Primary Dysautonomias"},{"id":"D000001342","term":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9762","name":"Hypotension","asFound":"Hypotension","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9764","name":"Hypotension, Orthostatic","asFound":"Orthostatic Hypotension","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27671","name":"Orthostatic Intolerance","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4333","name":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27669","name":"Primary Dysautonomias","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
