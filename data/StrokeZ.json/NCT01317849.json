All patients presenting to one of the participating neurologists or general physicians within one months of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or TIA (eye or brain) are eligible for this trial. Eligible patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive multi-vitamins or placebo. The primary outcome event is the composite event \"stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from any vascular cause\", whichever occurs first. Our target is to recruit a total of 8,000 patients over the two years with a median follow-up of 3 years. Recruitment to the trial began in July 2011 and is planned to continue until December 2013. The investigators aim to complete final follow-up by the end of 2016."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["folic acid","B vitamins","secondary prevention","stroke","randomized controlled trial","homocysteine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"vitamin supplements","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Folic Acid","Drug: Vitamin B6","Drug: Vitamin B12"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Folic Acid","description":"0.8mg","armGroupLabels":["vitamin supplements"],"otherNames":["folate"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin B6","description":"10mg","armGroupLabels":["vitamin supplements"],"otherNames":["Pyridoxine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin B12","description":"500ug","armGroupLabels":["vitamin supplements"],"otherNames":["Cyanocobalamin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"0.8 mg","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"10mg","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"500ug","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent stroke","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Death due to other vascular causes","timeFrame":"3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TIA","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Revascularization procedures","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Dementia","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Depression","timeFrame":"3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients presenting within one months of ischemic stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or TIA\n* Homocysteine level ≥ 15μmol／L\n* Agree to take study medication;Be geographically accessible for follow-up\n* Provide written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Other cause of ischemic stroke (cardioembolism; stroke of other determined etiology, and stroke of undetermined etiology according to TOAST subtypes) or hemorrhagic stroke (intracranial vascular malformations; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; trauma and bleeding disorders etc)\n* Use of vitamin supplements containing folate, B6 or B12\n* Pregnancy or women of child-bearing potential who are at risk of pregnancy\n* Limited life expectancy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gang Zhao, MD","affiliation":"the Department of Neurology , Xijing Hospital","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Xijing Hosptial","city":"Xi'an","state":"Shanxi","zip":"710032","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":34.25833,"lon":108.92861}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23490255","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Liu X, Shi M, Xia F, Han J, Liu Z, Wang B, Yang F, Li L, Wu S, Wang L, Liu N, Lv Y, Zhao G.
