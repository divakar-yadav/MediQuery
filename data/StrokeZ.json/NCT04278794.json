Sixty percent of these older adults (\\> 65 years) will return to their homes after a stroke and will require ongoing rehabilitation. About 92% of older adults have two or more chronic conditions. These patients often require services from a number of providers in a number of settings and are therefore, susceptible to fragmented health care when transitioning from hospital to home. New interventions are needed to improve the quality of care as patients move from hospital to home after a stroke. The proposed research project will examine the impact of a new intervention on patient/caregiver health, patient/caregiver and provider experience and costs, compared to usual health care services. The new intervention will be coordinated by a system navigator and consists of four core components: 1) development of a comprehensive discharge plan, 2) up to 6 home visits (supported by phone calls) by an interprofessional outpatient team, 3) monthly case conferences including the interprofessional care team who will discuss and focus on the patient's goals and care needs, and 4) linkages to other healthcare and community services. This multidisciplinary project will build on our previous study, which provided the groundwork for further study of this new intervention.","detailedDescription":"The overall purpose of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to adapt, implement and evaluate a novel person- and family-centred Transitional Care Stroke Intervention (TCSI) for older adults (\\> 55 years) with stroke and multimorbidity (\\>2 chronic conditions) and their caregivers. The TCSI is a theory- and evidence-based 6-month intervention designed to improve the health, experience, and quality of transitioning from hospital-to-home for this vulnerable population. An effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I design will be used, which will focus primarily on examining the effectiveness of the TCSI on quadruple aim outcomes: (i) patient and caregiver health outcomes, (ii) patient and caregiver experience, (iii) provider/manager experience, and (iv) patient healthcare service use costs, and will also evaluate implementation outcomes (e.g., barriers, facilitators, fidelity). Our earlier pre-post study provided evidence to support the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the TCSI on reducing hospital readmissions and emergency department visits (for any cause). These improvements were achieved at no additional cost. The key components of the TCSI in this earlier study included home visits supported by telephone calls by an interprofessional team (IP), patient-centered care planning, and care coordination/recruitment. The following enhancements to the TCSI will be included in the trial: 1) integrating the navigator role across the care continuum, 2) testing the TCSI with a larger sample and more rigorous (RCT) design, 3) enhancing patient self-management, and 4) evaluating the impact of the intervention on caregiver health outcomes and experience. These improvements alongside the inclusion of additional evaluation measures will enable rigorous evaluation of the TCSI and position it for future scale-up and spread"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Older adults","Multimorbidity","Transitional care","Virtual care","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I design.","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Study patients will be blinded to their group allocation.
