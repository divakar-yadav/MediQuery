The main intervention measures included: 1) non-invasive ventilator treatment, generally at least once every night and typically not exceeding continuous daily usage.; 2) attention to feeding and sleeping positions, with a recommended sleeping position of lateral recumbent and the head of the bed raised by 20-30°; 3) swallowing function training, such as tongue muscle stretching training, assisted anterior jaw protrusion training, lemon ice stimulation to the soft palate, pharyngeal wall, etc., generally 5 days per week, twice per day, 5-20 minutes each time; 4) pulmonary ultrashort wave therapy, generally at least 2-3 times a week, and not more than once a day; 5) physical therapy, such as intensive training for gross motor functions including lifting the head, turning over, sitting, crawling, standing, etc., generally 3-5 days per week, 1-2 times per day, 5-20 min each time.","armGroupLabels":["the control group","the experimental group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intermittent Oro-esophageal Tube Feeding","description":"The specific procedure was as follows: the infant was placed in a semi-recumbent or sitting position with the head fixed. Before each feeding, the infant's oral and nasal secretions were to be cleared. An intermittent oro-esophageal tube was appropriately lubricated with water on the head part. The professional medical staff held the tube and slowly inserted it through one side of the mouth into the upper part of the esophagus. The depth of insertion depended on the patient's age and height. After each feeding, the tube was immediately removed, and the patient was held upright for at least 30 minutes in case of reflux.","armGroupLabels":["the experimental group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Nasogastric Tube Feeding","description":"Nasogastric Tube Feeding were used for feeding to provide nutritional support. Each feeding was administered by a nurse using the infant's mother's breast milk through the tube. The amount of each feeding varied from 20 to 100 ml depending on the age of the infant, with feedings given every 2 to 3 hours, approximately 10 times per day. The duration of each feeding procedure ranged from 10 to 20 minutes. The total daily intake ranged from 200 to 1000 ml. Each tube was kept indwelling for 5 to 7 days. When the tube needed to be replaced, it was removed after the last feeding of a day and a new tube was to be inserted through the other nostril on the following morning to continue the nutritional support.","armGroupLabels":["the control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Social Functioning Scale","description":"The Social Functioning Scale includes multiple subscales, and the score range is generally 0-100.
