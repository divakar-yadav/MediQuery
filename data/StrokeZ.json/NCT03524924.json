Efficacy and safety of edoxaban will be assessed in a cohort of very elderly patients (≥80 years of age) with NVAF. A secondary analysis will correlate outcomes with frailty defined according to SHARE-FI (not-frail, pre-frail or frail).","detailedDescription":"Aim of the study To assess the efficacy and safety of edoxaban in a cohort of very elderly patients (≥80 years of age) with NVAF.\n\nEdoxaban has never been tested in elderly frail patients. In both sexes, there is a non-linear association between age and frailty. A secondary analysis according to frailty assessment (not-frail, pre-frail or frail) will be also performed.\n\nStudy Design Observational prospective cohort study including patients of ≥80 years of age with a new diagnosis of NVAF. Edoxaban 60 mg (or 30 mg for patients with CrCL 15 - 50 mL/min or with body weight ≤ 60 kg) will be administered to all patients. All participants will be stratified according to frailty, as assessed by SHARE-FI score, to non-frail, pre-frail, and frail.\n\nStudy Population Patients of both sexes, of ≥80 years of age with a new diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation and without contraindications to Edoxaban.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe following events will be included as outcomes:\n\n* arterial ischemic events (TIA or stroke documented a CT scan; documented systemic embolism)\n* major bleeding events (according to the ISTH definition)\n* clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNM), defined as bleeding that did not meet the definition of major bleeding, but considered clinically significant (including spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeding or rectal bleeding; macroscopic haematuria or urethral bleeding requiring medical attention; skin haematoma \\>25 cm2; and gingival bleeding or spontaneous ear-nose-throat bleeding lasting ≥5 min) and/or resulted in discontinuation of study medication18.\n* death (divided into cardiovascular death, fatal bleeding and other causes of death).\n\nFollow up Follow-up visits will be performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months to assess adherence and compliance to therapy, evaluation of relevant blood test and clinical assessment.\n\nTemporary discontinuation of edoxaban for a planned surgical intervention will be allowed.\n\nPatients will be followed until the occurrence of a first outcome event, permanent discontinuation of edoxaban or the end of follow-up period, whichever comes first."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","elderly","edoxaban","frailty","SHARE-FI","Stroke","Major bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"24 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"non-frail","description":"Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI) score Female: \\< 0.3151361243 Male: \\< 1.211878526"},{"label":"pre-frail","description":"Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI) score Female: 0.3151361243 to \\< 2.1301121973 Male: 1.211878526 to \\< 3.0052612772"},{"label":"frail","description":"Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI) score Female: 2.1301121973 to \\< 6 Male: 3.0052612772 to \\< 7"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cumulative incidence of arterial ischemic events, major bleeding, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding","description":"Cumulative incidence of arterial ischemic events (stroke/TIA and systemic embolism), major bleeding according to ISTH definition, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (bleeding not meeting major bleeding criteria but considered clinically significant).","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 24 months"},{"measure":"Death","description":"Divided into cardiovascular death, fatal bleeding and other causes of death","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation of frailty, as measured with Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe - Frailty Instrument, with the cumulative incidence of stroke/TIA, systemic embolism, major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding.","description":"Patients will be divided into 3 groups according to frailty measured with Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe - Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI) which provides 3 patient categories (non-frail, pre-frail and frail).\n\nA score of \\< 0.3151361243 defines non frail female patients;
