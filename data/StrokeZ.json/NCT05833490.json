Clinical trials of stroke rehabilitation have examined the therapeutic utility of several neuromodulatory devices to improve efficacy of motor training. However, there is limited knowledge on the effects of sensory-based priming techniques using repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) post stroke. This project focuses on understanding the effect of rPMS on motor skill performance in persons with stroke.","detailedDescription":"The central hypothesis of this study is that rPMS is a suitable priming technique for enhancing motor skill performance in individuals with stroke. The investigators plan to test our hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aim:\n\nTo determine whether rPMS can facilitate lower limb's motor skill performance more than sham rPMS in individuals with stroke.\n\nHypothesis: The effect of stimulation on lower limb's motor skill performance will be measured using a visuomotor tracking task at different time points: baseline, immediately after, at 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after stimulation. Individuals with stroke during the rPMS condition will demonstrate greater motor skill performance following rPMS and will be able to sustain the enhanced performance at 30 and 60 minutes after the stimulation, compared to sham condition.\n\nThis study will improve our understanding of the effects of rPMS, thus encouraging the use of a single session of rPMS as a priming tool to enhance motor skill performance. The proposal is important as it is the first to study the time course effects of rPMS on lower limb's motor skill performance in stroke populations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["rPMS","motor skill performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"participants will be blind to the experimental condition.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory-based priming","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive rPMS at 10% above motor threshold with the coil placed on the Tibialis Anterior muscle belly. rPMS parameters will be: 40 trains, intermittently (3) seconds on, (19) seconds off, with an intensity \\~10% above motor threshold.","interventionNames":["Other: Repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS)"]},{"label":"Sham Priming","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive sham rPMS at a very low intensity with the coil placed on the dorsal part of the foot. rPMS parameters will be: 40 trains, intermittently (3) seconds on, (19) seconds off, with an intensity at 5% of maximum stimulator output.","interventionNames":["Other: Sham Priming"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS)","description":"Repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS) is an external device that delivers repetitive pulsed magnetic fields of sufficient magnitude, will be applied on the tibialis anterior muscle belly at \\~ 10% of motor threshold, in order to induce neural action potentials in the lower extremities.","armGroupLabels":["Sensory-based priming"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham Priming","description":"Sham Priming using the Repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS), it will be applied on the dorsal part of the foot with a minimal intensity at 5% of maximum stimulator output, that is of insufficient magnitude to induce changes in the muscle or nerves of lower extremities.","armGroupLabels":["Sham Priming"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor skill performance","description":"The investigators will assess motor skill performance by asking the participants to track a computer-generated sinusoidal target with ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion in a custom-built ankle-tracking device.
