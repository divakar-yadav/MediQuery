High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for WML. WML are therefore key lesions in the causal chain linking vascular factors and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHowever, it has not been shown that lowering BP could limit the progression of the WML in people with cognitive impairment.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis of slowing progression of WML by lowering BP in patients with memory complaints with a moderate to high grade of WML on brain MRI.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: PROBE (Prospective randomized open blinded end-point) trial. Blind reading of both MRI for every patient in each group. After stratified randomization on age, sex and center, patients will be assigned to two strategies:\n\n* Reinforced Group (RG): enhanced strategy aiming at a systolic BP \\<135 mmHg;\n* Usual Group (UG): usual strategy based on the usual routine care.\n\nSAMPLE SIZE: patients will be enrolled (410 in each arm) in 12 Memory Resources and Research Center (CMRR) with access to 1.5 T or more MRI.\n\nCONDUCT OF THE STUDY:\n\nDuration of the inclusion period: 96 months and 2 weeks. Patient participation duration: 36 months + 6 months max Total study duration: 11 years. Clinical and para-clinical evaluation: MRI as part of research at the beginning of the study and before the end of the study at 36 months + 6 months max (primary endpoint); Clinical evaluation of neuropsychological tests at the beginning of the study and yearly ; walking speed measurement single leg stance balance test ; repeated BP measurements; monitoring of neurological signs and symptoms; blood test at the beginning of the study (electrolytes, lipid profiles, fasting blood glucose, if not existing); MRI if not existing for validation of the inclusion criterion and performed in the ordinary course."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Stroke","Antihypertensive Agents","Arterial Pressure","Memory Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":820,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"blood pressure lowering algorithm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"enhanced strategy aiming to reduce systolic blood pressure to \\<135 mmHg","interventionNames":["Other: blood pressure lowering algorithm"]},{"label":"usual strategy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"usual strategy based on the usual care of routine care","interventionNames":["Other: usual strategy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"blood pressure lowering algorithm","description":"The treatments used in the \"enhanced strategy\" arm are those proposed by national (HAS2013, SFHTA2013) and international (ESH 2013) recommendations, according to their Marketing Authorization and Summary of Product Characteristics : Diuretics, beta-blockers, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Calcium Channel Blockers Throughout the study, choice of drugs in each therapeutic class is left on the investigator's initiative.
