In fact, administration of fluid to improve cardiac output is the mainstay of hemodynamic resuscitation. However, not all patients respond to fluid therapy, and excessive fluid administration is harmful. Therefore, the vascular filling strategy requires a thorough hemodynamic evaluation.\n\nMany predictive tools for fluid responsiveness have been validated in adults, and are based on heart-lung interaction in ventilated patients. Up to now, respiratory variation in aortic blood flow peak velocity, measured by transthoracic or transoesophageal cardiac echocardiography, is the only variable shown to effectively predict fluid responsiveness in children.\n\nHowever, the use of these methods does not allow continuous monitoring (trans-thoracic echocardiography) or is not easily achievable in current practice (trans-esophageal echocardiography). In addition, these monitoring tools require learning and inter- and intra-individual variability is not negligible, ranging from 1% to 20%.\n\nThe Pressure Recording Analytical Method, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, is an uncalibrated pulse contour analysis, installed in the Mostcare® system, that allows a continuous estimation of the stroke volume and thus of the cardiac output, by the relationship between the area under the curve of the systolic portion of the arterial blood pressure curve and the dynamic impedance of the cardiovascular system.\n\nThe goal of this study is to assess the ability of dynamic cardiovascular variables measured using Mostcare® to predict fluid responsiveness in pediatric surgical critical care patients, sedated, intubated and ventilated, in prone position, by comparing the changes in stroke volume (SV), induced by a volume expansion (VE), measured by trans-thoracic echocardiography. For the purpose of the study, responders (Rs) to VE are patients showing an increase in SV measured using transthoracic echocardiography of at least 15% after VE."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypovolemia","Hemorrhage","Fluid Responsiveness"],"keywords":["Volume expansion in children","Mostcare® device","Fluid responsiveness","Stroke volume","Transthoracic cardiac echocardiography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients less than 6 months old","description":"Patients less than 6 months old admitted to the pediatric surgical ICU of the Necker-Enfants Malades university hospital and for whom volume expansion is indicated.","interventionNames":["Other: Mostcare® device","Other: Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound"]},{"label":"Patients between 6 and 12 months old","description":"Patients between 6 and 12 months old admitted to the pediatric surgical ICU of the Necker-Enfants Malades university hospital and for whom volume expansion is indicated.","interventionNames":["Other: Mostcare® device","Other: Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound"]},{"label":"Patients between 1 and 6 years old","description":"Patients between 1 and 6 years old admitted to the pediatric surgical ICU of the Necker-Enfants Malades university hospital and for whom volume expansion is indicated.","interventionNames":["Other: Mostcare® device","Other: Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound"]},{"label":"Patients between 6 and 10 years old","description":"Patients between 6 and 10 years old admitted to the pediatric surgical ICU of the Necker-Enfants Malades university hospital and for whom volume expansion is indicated.","interventionNames":["Other: Mostcare® device","Other: Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mostcare® device","description":"The Moscare® system is connected to the patient monitoring devices.
