Many stroke survivors may suffer from long-term sequelae of stroke such as hemiplegia. The effects of rehabilitation therapy are limited. The development of new treatment strategies is essential. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method to stimulate the focal area of the brain for restoring brain function. The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of rTMS on the motor recovery in patients with hemiplegic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tradtional Theta burst stimulation (TBS) rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) rTMS to contralesional hemisphere based on a previous study (Huang et al., 2005)","interventionNames":["Device: Traditional Theta burst stimulation (TBS)"]},{"label":"Modified TBS rTMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive modified cTBS rTMS to contralesional hemisphere based on a previous study (Nyffeler et al., 2006)","interventionNames":["Device: Modified TBS rTMS"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive sham cTBS rTMS to contralesional hemisphere.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham rTMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Traditional Theta burst stimulation (TBS)","armGroupLabels":["Tradtional Theta burst stimulation (TBS) rTMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Modified TBS rTMS","armGroupLabels":["Modified TBS rTMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham rTMS","armGroupLabels":["Sham rTMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Keyboard tapping test","description":"Participants will be asked to tap a key of a computer keyboard as fast as possible in five seconds.
