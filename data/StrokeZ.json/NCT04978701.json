Therefore, we planned to explore the predictive value of human microbiome and its metabolites in stroke prognosis through a multicenter cohort study","detailedDescription":"This study was designed as a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study. 2000 patients with AIS will be enrolled continuously through multiple centers. Oral swabs, feces (the day after admission, 1 month, 3 months after the onset of disease) and blood samples (the day after admission, 3 months after the onset of disease) will be collected. After the onset of the disease (1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months), outpatient/telephone follow-up will be conducted to evaluate the neurological function scores of the patients, and the recurrence of stroke and other cardio-cerebrovascular events will be recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke, microbiome,
