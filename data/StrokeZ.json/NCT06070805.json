It may contribute to poor prognosis in a number of ways, including its effect on platelet function. We aimed to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of depression on the occurrence of cardio-cerebral vascular events (CCVE) and dysfunction of arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) in MHD patients.\n\nIn this study, MHD patients were recruited and divided into depression and non-depression groups using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) in this prospective cohort study. Their clinical and laboratory indicators were collected and the occurrence of CCVE and DAVF were recorded through clinical follow-up, and analyzed, and the differences and possible influencing factors of CCVE and DAVF occurrence were assessed between the two groups of patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardio-cerebral Vascular Events","Arteriovenous Fistula Dysfunction"],"keywords":["maintenance hemodialysis patients","depression","cardio-cerebral vascular events","arteriovenous fistula dysfunction","platelet"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":286,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non-depression group","description":"The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) will be applied to assess the depressive status of all enrolled patients.
