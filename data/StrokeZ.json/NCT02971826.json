The REVIVETM SE is a device designed to restore the brain perfusion in patient with an intracranial artery occlusion. The REVIVETM Se device is not widely use in Europe and in France. The objective of this study is to assess the interest of using this device in the standard care of ischemic stroke in the radiology unit of the hospital Pierre Wertheimer, Lyon. The medical care will not be modified but data will be collected in order to determine whether or not this device is useful for the practice of the radiology unit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","thrombectomy","REVIVETM SE","MRI","Computed Tomography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Thrombectomy using the REVIVETM SE device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Thrombectomy using the REVIVETM SE device in patient with an ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Device: REVIVETM SE thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"REVIVETM SE thrombectomy","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy using the REVIVETM SE device in patient with an ischemic stroke due to an intracranial arterial occlusion","armGroupLabels":["Thrombectomy using the REVIVETM SE device"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"number of patients with a TICI score of 2b or 3 just after the thrombectomy","description":"The TICI score is a grading system which evaluate the degree of reperfusion as seen on arteriography","timeFrame":"up to 2 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of the other devices use during the thrombectomy (Gidewire, catheter, etc.)","description":"Review of the medical report which collected the devices used","timeFrame":"up to 2 days"},{"measure":"Number of other procedures to treat the patient (thrombolysis, thromboaspiration, etc)","description":"Review of the medical report which collected the acute treatments","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Time to obtain the appropriate recanalization (TICI 2b or 3)","description":"Time of recanalization reported by the investigator on the medical report","timeFrame":"At the end of the procedure -
