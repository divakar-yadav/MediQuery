There will be one single test occasion, during which 6 test trials will be performed in random order. Deep pressure will be applied by means of a Johnstone air splint, that will be (1) not inflated, (2) inflated constantly, or (3) inflated intermittently. Each of these 3 inflation conditions will be performed twice, i.e. with and without a non-hemiplegic arm movement (triggering hypertonia at hemiplegic side)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Deep Pressure","Muscle Activity","General Relaxation","Stroke","Hypertonia, Muscle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"uninflated -
