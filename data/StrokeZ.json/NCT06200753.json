However, the potential benefits of EVT beyond this time window remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, the investigators established a TRACK-LVO Late linked cohort, specifically designed to investigate the outcomes of EVT in patients with LVO presenting beyond 24 hours from last known well.\n\nThis cohort includes patients from the TRACK-LVO registry who received either EVT or best medical treatment (BMT) beyond 24 hours from symptom onset. The cohort focuses on patients with LVO in the anterior circulation, confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the EVT group. To maximize the sample size in the BMT group, the investigators also included patients with LVO confirmed using transcranial Doppler and carotid ultrasonography, in addition to the aforementioned imaging modalities.\n\nConsistent with the TRACK-LVO registry, LVO is defined as an occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) , M1 and/or M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), A1 and/or A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), any segments of vertebral artery (VA), basilar artery (BA), or P1 and/or P2 segments of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA).\n\nThe investigators collect comprehensive patient information, including baseline demographic profiles, imaging characteristics such as ischemic core volume and FVH-DWI mismatch, CT/MR perfusion parameters, and treatment-related complications, for both EVT and BMT groups. For patients in the EVT group, the investigators also obtained detailed information on the EVT procedure and angiographic images.\n\nBy establishing this cohort, the investigators aim to provide high-level evidence to guide the treatment of a subgroup of stroke patients who present beyond the current guideline-recommended time window for EVT. The findings will contribute to determining the superiority of EVT over BMT in ischemic stroke patients with LVO and extended time from symptom onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endovascular Thrombectomy","Large Vessel Occlusion","Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke, Endovascular Therapy,"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular therapy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Best medical treatment","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical Thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mechanical Thrombectomy","description":"Mechanical Thrombectomy: A stroke treatment method involving the use of a device to extract a blood clot from the blood vessels, restoring blood flow and reducing brain damage.\n\nIschemic Post-conditioning: After thrombectomy, a procedure involving inflating and deflating a balloon in situ for four cycles of 2 minutes each, reducing reperfusion injury and minimizing neural damage.\n\nSelective Hypothermia: Administering cold saline either intra-arterially or within the cerebral sinus to lower brain temperature, mitigating ischemia-induced injury.","armGroupLabels":["Best medical treatment","Endovascular therapy"],"otherNames":["Ischemic post-conditioning","Selective Hypohermia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified ranking scale (mRS) at 90 days","description":"A 0-6 scale running from perfect health without symptoms to death.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"any hemorrhagic transformation on subsequent imaging associated with a neurological decline of at least 4 points increase on the NIHSS score","timeFrame":"72 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at 90 days","description":"The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4.
