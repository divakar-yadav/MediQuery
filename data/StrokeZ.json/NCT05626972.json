The logistic advantage of a single bolus infusion of TNK (compared to 1-h infusion of tPA) would markedly reduce the needle-to-groin and Door-in- door-out time. The implementation of a quality improvement package (QIP) in the TNKCAT trial would directly improve the quality and efficiency of the Health Care System. In addition, an improvement of transfer models would reduce the cost of unnecessary transfers, together with the fact that TNK is up to 50% less expensive than tPA, makes the TNKCAT in firm line with the sustainability strategy of the National Health Care system.\n\nOutcomes: The aim of the present study is to determine the safety and efficacy of TNK (0.25mh/kg) compared to tPA (0.9 mg/kg) in patients with Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) suspicion, candidates for thrombectomy, in both Mothership and Drip-and-Ship scenarios.\n\nStudy Duration: 2 years. Patients will participate in the trial for 3 months.\n\nStudy design: Multicentre, prospective, randomized open-label blinded endpoint (PROBE) phase III study in acute stroke patients with LVO suspicion within 4.5 hours of stroke onset, candidates for EVT. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard dose tPA (0.9 mg/kg) or TNK (0.25mg/kg) before EVT.\n\nClinical, imaging and outcome data will be collected at baseline, 24-36 hours, day 3, day 5 and day 90.\n\nEstimated enrollment: 500 patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","large vessel occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Clinical outcome at day 90 will be obtained by centralized telephone call of the mRS in a blinded manner by certified personnel of the Catalan Stroke Program.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase (TNK)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Drug: Alteplase (tPA) Dose: 0.9 mg/kg Route: Intravenous (IV) infusion","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Alteplase (tPA)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Drug: Tenecteplase (TNK) Dose: 0.25 mg/kg Route: Intravenous (IV) bolus injection","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard dose tPA (0.9 mg/kg) or TNK (0.25mg/kg) before endovascular therapy (EVT)","armGroupLabels":["Alteplase (tPA)","Tenecteplase (TNK)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale score at 3 months","description":"Shift analysis of the modified Rankin scale score at 3 months","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Mortality rate","description":"Mortality at 3 months","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and neurological deterioration","description":"Symptomatic ICH defined as intracerebral haemorrhage (PH2) within 36 hours of treatment, combined with neurological deterioration leading to an increase of ≥ 4 points on the National institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) from baseline, or the lowest NIHSS value between baseline and 24 hours.","timeFrame":"24 -36hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rates of mRS 0-1 at 3 months","description":"Modified Rankin scale score (0-1) rates","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Rates of mRS 0-2 at 3 months","description":"Modified Rankin scale score (0-2) rates","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Rates of pre-interventional recanalization","description":"Recanalization rate","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"Dramatic clinical recovery before endovascular treatment (EVT)","description":"Dramatic clinical recovery before EVT (Improvement in \\> 8 points in the NIHSS score or NIHSS score \\< 2 before groin puncture)","timeFrame":"before the procedure"},{"measure":"First pass TICI 3, final TICI 2b-3","description":"Rates of first pass TICI 3, final TICI 2b-3","timeFrame":"immediately after the procedure"},{"measure":"Distal embolization during EVT","description":"Rates of distal embolization during EVT","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"Needle-to-groin times and DIDO times","description":"Differences in needle-to-groin times in Mothership patients and in DIDO times in Drip-and-Ship patients.","timeFrame":"immediately after the procedure"},{"measure":"Time metrics between TNKCAT and non-TNKCAT centers","description":"Differences in time metrics between TNKCAT and non-TNKCAT centers","timeFrame":"at the end of the study"},{"measure":"Final infarct volume on follow up CT","description":"Differences in final infarct volume on follow up CT","timeFrame":"24-36 hours follow up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients eligible to undergo intravenous thrombolysis (tPA or TNK) within 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke.\n* Suspicion of Cerebral vascular occlusion on brain imaging.\n* Age \\>18 years old\n* Men and women (women with child-bearing potential are excluded, unless pregnancy test negative/ confirmed menstrual period/ postmenopausal or hysterectomy).\n* A new focal disabling neurologic deficit consistent with acute cerebral ischemia.\n* Informed consent obtained from subject or acceptable subject surrogate (i.e. next of kin, or legal representative), or Differed Inform Consent (DIC) to avoid any delay in the initiation of iv thrombolysis.
