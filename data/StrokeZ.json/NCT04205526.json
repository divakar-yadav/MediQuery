The overall goal of this multi-center feasibility trial is not to demonstrate that rTMS is effective, but to demonstrate that each site can recruit the assigned number of patients within a certain period, perform the stimulation procedure in conjunction with the protocol-specified physiotherapy intervention, complete the therapy protocol and enter complete datasets for each patient into the CanStim database. A secondary aim is to identify potential weaknesses of the consensus protocol that may need to be modified before performing a larger scale trial testing for the efficacy of the intervention.","detailedDescription":"Rehabilitation is critical for reducing stroke-related disability. Although intensive physiotherapy improves function after a stroke, the frequency and intensity of therapy in a standard clinical rehabilitation session is insufficient to invoke these changes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe, non-invasive method of stimulating the human brain. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) may have the potential to enhance the brain's ability to re-learn specific functions and reduce the amount of standard therapy required to achieve certain functional gains after stroke. Although two recent multicenter studies have begun to test the benefits of applying rTMS during stroke rehabilitation, large scale clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of rTMS for post-stroke functional motor recovery are lacking. The use of rTMS interventions in stroke rehabilitation trials has been limited by a lack of consensus regarding the optimal protocol for the clinical application of TMS in stroke populations. The Canadian Platform for Trials in Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (CanStim) is a national platform that aims to facilitate multicenter clinical trials for non-invasive brain stimulation interventions to augment recovery from stroke. As a first step, CanStim investigators convened a multidisciplinary team of experts in rTMS from institutions across Canada to form the CanStim Consensus Working Group and develop consensus recommendations for a protocol to deliver rTMS as an adjunct to standard therapy in a national stroke rehabilitation clinical trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Feasibility Study"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The only individual that will be unblinded is the person administering the rTMS.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":49,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sub-acute stroke patients will be randomized to receive actual rTMS treatment. 1Hz rTMS will be applied over contralesional M1 at an intensity of 120% resting motor threshold once daily for 30 minutes (approximately 1800 pulses) for a total of 15 sessions.","interventionNames":["Device: Active rTMS"]},{"label":"Sham control","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sub-acute stroke patients randomized to receive sham rTMS.
