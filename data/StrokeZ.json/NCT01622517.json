During the first part, the investigators propose to develop a fully automated system (RAPID) for processing of CT Perfusion (CTP) images that will generate brain maps of the ischemic core and penumbra. There will be no patient enrollment in part one of this project.\n\nDuring the second part, the investigators aim to demonstrate that physicians in the emergency setting, with the aid of a fully automated CTP analysis program (RAPID), can accurately predict response to recanalization in stroke patients undergoing revascularization. To achieve this aim the investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of 240 consecutive stroke patients who will undergo a CTP scan prior to endovascular therapy. The study will be conducted at four sites (Stanford University, St Luke's Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Emory University/Grady Hospital). Patients will have an early follow-up MRI scan within 12+/-6 hours to assess reperfusion and a late follow-up MRI scan at day 5 to determine the final infarct."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":201,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS Score","description":"A \"favorable clinical response\", defined as an 8-point or more improvement on the NIH score when comparing the baseline score to the 30-day score or a 30-day NIH score of 0-1, will be the primary endpoint for the study","timeFrame":"30 Day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Score","description":"90 day modified Rankin Score 0-2, 90 day modified Rankin distribution, and 90 day Rankin Score 0-1","timeFrame":"90 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. be 18 or older;\n2. have a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke and a score of 5 or more points on the NIHSSS;\n3. be scheduled to undergo intraarterial (IA) therapy for acute hemispheric stroke (either as primary therapy or as adjuvant therapy following intravenous tPA treatment);\n4. be scheduled to have a standard CT including perfusion imaging and CT angiography of the circle of Willis (CTA) prior to IA therapy;\n5. begin intra-arterial thrombectomy within 90 minutes of completion of the CT scan and within 18 hours of symptom onset.
