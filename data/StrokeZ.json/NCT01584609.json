Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke who have evidence of a large vessel (2.5mm or greater in diameter) occlusion in the cerebral circulation will be assigned to either the Penumbra System with the Separator 3D or the Penumbra System without the Separator 3D. Each treated patient will be followed and assessed for 3 months after randomization. Up to 230 evaluable patients at up to 50 centers presenting with acute ischemic stroke in vessels accessible to the Penumbra Separator 3D System for revascularization within 8 hours of symptom onset. The hypothesis to be tested is that the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the Separator 3D for the revascularization of large vessel occlusion is not inferior to the Penumbra System alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke From Large Vessel Occlusion"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","large vessel occlusion","mechanical thrombectomy","revascularization","Penumbra System","Separator 3D"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":198,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Penumbra System with Separator 3D","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Penumbra System with Separator 3D"]},{"label":"Penumbra System alone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Penumbra System alone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Penumbra System with Separator 3D","description":"The Separator 3D is an additional Separator with a new tip configuration for the Penumbra System.","armGroupLabels":["Penumbra System with Separator 3D"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Penumbra System alone","description":"The Penumbra System® is a new generation of neuro-embolectomy devices specifically designed to remove thrombus through aspiration.The treatment paradigm of this System involves the introduction of the Reperfusion Catheter through a guide catheter into the intracranial vasculature, and guided over an appropriate guidewire to the site of primary occlusion.
