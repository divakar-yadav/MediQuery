Stroke can have adverse effects on oral care and health. Little is known about current oral care practices in stroke care settings.","detailedDescription":"For a variety of related reasons, stroke can adversely affect oral care. Physical impairment, coordination, sensory or cognitive deficits may accompany a stroke and can impact on independent oral care. Post-stroke alterations in facial muscle mass or movement and sensory problems may result in poorly controlled dentures.\n\nDysphagia can contribute to oral care concerns in a number of ways. Oral intake of fluids may be restricted to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, which in turn can contribute to xerostomia. Nutritional supplements, often prescribed, are high in sugar and may predispose to caries. Furthermore, because of swallowing impairment, pharmacological interventions are often administered in syrup consistency, which is sugar-based, and may also predispose to caries. Reduced swallowing ability causes ineffective clearance of bacteria and debris from the mouth leading to caries and infection.\n\nSome pharmacological interventions in stroke care are known to have oral side effects. Oxygen therapy frequently administered in acute stroke management is known to cause mucosal drying and blistering. The absence of normal chewing patterns as a result of pain, physical or sensory impairment can also reduce salivary function. Xerostomia also causes pain, taste disturbance, chewing, and swallowing difficulties.\n\nSpeech and denture retention is also affected by inadequate saliva. This, in turn, increases plaque formation, predisposes to opportunistic oral infections, periodontal disease, and caries, conditions which place the individual at greater risk of pain, tooth loss and tooth substance loss. Chronic periodontal infection is currently being tentatively linked with the incidence of the stroke itself, while others have demonstrated a relationship with other systemic diseases including pneumonia and cardiovascular disease.\n\nHealthcare-led oral care is a complex intervention and comprises a number of elements. These include assessment, accessing further assistance as required, and the use of appropriate equipment and cleaning methods. Knowledge is also required to assess and apply oral care at an individual level."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gingivitis","Periodontitis","Dental Hygiene"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Assessment of Oral care as per patient personal choice","description":"We just inquire from patients or attendants about products used, the timing for oral care."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of Dental Hygiene","description":"assessment of dental hygiene will be done with ROAG scale","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Dental care tools survey","description":"ask about tools for dental care in stroke units","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient with diagnosed case of stroke\n* Both gender will be included.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a known case of bleeding diathesis.\n* patient not willing to participate\n* patient with known head and neck cancer and oral pathology","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with Stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Muhammad Hassan, MD","affiliation":"Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University","city":"Islamabad","state":"Capital","zip":"44000","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":33.72148,"lon":73.04329}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"Data will be shared at reasonable request."}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000005891","term":"Gingivitis"},{"id":"D000010518","term":"Periodontitis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010510","term":"Periodontal Diseases"},{"id":"D000009059","term":"Mouth Diseases"},{"id":"D000009057","term":"Stomatognathic Diseases"},{"id":"D000007239","term":"Infections"},{"id":"D000005882","term":"Gingival Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13117","name":"Periodontitis","asFound":"Periodontitis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M8693","name":"Gingivitis","asFound":"Gingivitis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13109","name":"Periodontal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11709","name":"Mouth Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11707","name":"Stomatognathic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9973","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6058","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8684","name":"Gingival Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
