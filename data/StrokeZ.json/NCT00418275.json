In the United States, it is estimated that more than 400,000 patients are discharged each year from hospitals after a stroke. The loss of these patients from the work force and the extended hospitalization they require during recovery make serious economic impact. In Taiwan, Cerebrovascular disease is the second cause of death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Recombinant Human Plasminogen Activator (HTUPA)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major neurological improvement measured by NIHSS at 24 hours after treatment. \"Major neurological improvement\" is defined as 4-point improvement in the NIHSS measurement."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major neurological improvement measured by NIHSS at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days after treatment."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects with cerebral ischemia at any location producing a serious measurable deficit by NIHSS scale and who received study medication within 5 hours after the onset of the symptom.
