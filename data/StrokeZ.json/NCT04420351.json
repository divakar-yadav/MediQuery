TRUST is a prospective multicenter, randomized, blinded-endpoint study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Urokinase Thrombolysis for patients with minor stroke.","detailedDescription":"China is currently faced with the heaviest stroke burden due to the tremendous population and susceptibility to cerebrovascular disease. As has been assessed, deaths caused by cerebrovascular disease are three times of cardiovascular disease. Within whole population with cerebrovascular disease, minor stoke have taken a significant part of the disease burden. Thus the population with minor stoke is one of the most important parts in efficient prevention of cerebrovascular disease. According to phase I and II data from national stoke registration in China, 35.25% to 42.23% cases were minor ischemic strokes. However, in clinical practice, the minor ischemic stroke patients are likely to be ignored and some might have poor prognosis. As has been demonstrated by a number of studies, up to one third of the acute non-disabling ischemic stroke without in-time thrombolysis may suffer from disabling or death at 90-day follow-up.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of thrombolysis compared usually with placebo, including the Third International Stroke Trail ( IST-3, rt-PA to placebo, patients within 3 hours after attack, with blood pressure lower than 185/110mmHg and NIHSS≤5)，National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study（ NINDS, rt-PA to placebo, patients with mild ischemic stroke recognized by 5 different definitions）.\n\nUrokinase is a kind of non-selective plasminogen activator, urokinase acted as effective catalyzer in the transferring of both free and protein-binding plasminogen to plasmin, thus inducing thrombolysis. As one of the widely used medication for intravenous thrombolysis in China, urokinase has been suggested the the efficacy and safety for ischemic stroke. With easier availability and lower price, urokinase has provided a promising alternation to patients who need thrombolysis in China, especially in less developed areas. The Chinese guideline for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke 2018 has recommended urokinase as an alternation in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6-hour time window as well, if rt-PA is not available or affordable. However, randomized and multicenter clinical trial of urokinase thrombolysis for minor stroke is still vacant, which couldn't provide more persuasive evidence.\n\nTRUST is a prospective multicenter, randomized, single-blind evaluation study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Urokinase Thrombolysis for patients with minor stroke. The trail will enroll a total of 1002 minor stroke patients within a 6 hour time window with a NIHSS score ≤5 at the time of randomization. Randomization will be 1:1 to Urokinase Thrombolysis (experimental) or Antiplatelet agents (control). Patients will receive 1 million units urokinase dissolved by 100ml saline through intravenous infusion within 30min or oral antiplatelet agents. All patients will undergo CT or MRI before treatment and will undergo the second CT within 36 hours after treatment. Patients will be followed up at 36h, 7d and 90 days. The primary outcome measures including the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale(mRS) of 0 or 1 at 90-day follow-up and the patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours. Secondary outcome measures cover new vascular events, the Progress of MRS score, Neurological impairment, Daily function evaluations, Quality of life assessments, Overall mortality and Adverse events and severe adverse events within 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Minor Stroke"],"keywords":["Thrombolysis","Urokinase","Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1005,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Urokinase thrombolysis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients of intervention group will receive 1 millions units urokinase dissolved by 100 saline through intravenous infusion within 30 minutes.","interventionNames":["Drug: Urokinase thrombolysis"]},{"label":"Antiplatelet treatment","type":"OTHER","description":"The control group will receive antiplatelet agents as decided by the physicians according to Chinese guideline for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke 2018","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin;Clopidogrel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Urokinase thrombolysis","description":"The patients of intervention group will receive 1 millions units urokinase dissolved by 100 saline through intravenous infusion within 30 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Urokinase thrombolysis"],"otherNames":["Urokinase"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin;Clopidogrel","description":"The control group will receive antiplatelet agents as decided by the physicians according to Chinese guideline for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke 2018.","armGroupLabels":["Antiplatelet treatment"],"otherNames":["Antiplatelet treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale(mRS) of 0 or 1 at 90-day follow-up","description":"mRS has 0-6 points, the higher the worse outcome.","timeFrame":"90 Days"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours","description":"Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 36 hours","timeFrame":"36 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with new vascular events","description":"Proportion of patients with new vascular events within 90 days(Ischemic stroke / hemorrhagic stroke / TIA / myocardial infarction / vascular death)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"MRS score","description":"To evaluate the progress of MRS score","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The ratio of patients with MRS 0-1 during the last visit in two groups","description":"mRS has 0-6 points, the higher the worse outcome.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) score","description":"Neurological impairment in two groups (changes in NIHSS score at 90-day follow-up).
