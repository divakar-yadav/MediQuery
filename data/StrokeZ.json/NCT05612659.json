The working Hypothesis is tsDCS and/or tES will enhance frontal theta oscillations as recorded on EEGs and improve task performance compared to sham stimulation.\n\nResults from this project can potentially lead to the development of a new research tool for assessing neuromodulation strategies to treat mental disorders and their comorbidities. It will also uncover the neural correlates of cognitive deficits in PSD and provide feasible biomarkers associated with treatment response in support of a larger clinical."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial Electrical stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive transcranial electrical stimulation.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Transcranial Electrical stimulation"]},{"label":"Transcutaneous direct current stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive Transcutaneous direct current stimulation","interventionNames":["Procedure: Transcutaneous direct current stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Transcranial Electrical stimulation","description":"Noninvasive electrical stimulation of lateral frontal cortex.","armGroupLabels":["Transcranial Electrical stimulation"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Transcutaneous direct current stimulation","description":"Noninvasive electrical stimulation of the T10 spinal column.","armGroupLabels":["Transcutaneous direct current stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EEG oscillations","description":"Theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations in the mid frontal EEG","timeFrame":"change from baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Behavior","description":"Response time in a multi source interference task","timeFrame":"during procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
