The study was conducted with 69 stroke patients (34 in the intervention group and 35 in the control group) and their caregivers. In the study, data were collected before discharge and three months after discharge. Discharge training and telephone counseling (one week after discharge and once a month for three months) were given to the caregivers of the patients in the intervention group.","detailedDescription":"This study, which was planned as a randomised controlled study, was conducted university hospital neurology clinic in Turkey. A total of 80 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomised to either the intervention and control groups.\n\nIn this study, Patient Information Form, Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index were used to collect data about patients, while Caregiver Information Form and Caregiver Burden Scale were used to collect data about caregivers Pre-tests were applied to patients and caregivers in the intervention and control groups before discharge. After the pre-tests were applied to the caregivers in the intervention group, discharge training was given."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Caregiver Burnout"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Interventional (Clinical Trial)","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Discharge training and telephone counseling","interventionNames":["Other: Discharge training and telephone counseling"]},{"label":"No Intervention: Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Routine care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Discharge training and telephone counseling","description":"The discharge training was given by using different teaching methods in the form of verbal expression, demonstration, and question and answer.
