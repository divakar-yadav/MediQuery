Because all PWA have word retrieval deficits, this project will test if greater language gains can be achieved by supplementing anomia intervention with excitatory brain stimulation to the left hemisphere and will evaluate associated functional brain changes to aid the optimization of neural reorganization to facilitate language processing.","detailedDescription":"Aphasia is a language impairment that commonly occurs following brain damage (e.g., stroke). While language rehabilitation can yield improved language functioning, treatment outcomes vary greatly across individuals. In chronic aphasia, language gains occur through the brain's inherent ability to reorganize (i.e., neuroplasticity).\n\nWhile Speech-language therapy (SLT) can target various language skills and modalities, the most pervasive deficit across all persons with aphasia (PWA) is difficulty with word finding. Thus, aphasia treatment often includes some form of intervention focused on improving naming abilities. As with language function in general, naming abilities in PWA seems to be associated with left hemisphere recruitment, particularly with the viable tissue at the rim of the lesion (perilesional areas). This project investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment (i.e. word-finding treatment).\n\nThis study investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory tDCS stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment. This project will provide novel mechanistic understanding of changes in functional brain connectivity in persons with post-stroke aphasia and how connectivity relates to treatment outcomes.\n\nThe aims of this study are as follows:\n\nAim 1. To investigate the benefits of using broad transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve word retrieval in persons with aphasia (PWA). Aim 2. To study functional brain changes related to this treatment. Aim 3. To examine behavioral and neural re-organization correlates related to treatment outcomes.\n\nAll participants will complete the following 3 components: (1) Baseline Assessment, (2) Interventions (i.e., SLT with active tDCS \\& sham tDCS , and (3) Outcome Testing (i.e., Behavioral \\& Brain Imaging). During the first week, each participant will complete all of the Neuropsychological Testing Battery and the first round of the outcome measures as pre-testing before starting SLT. Then the participant will complete 2 weeks of SLT accompanied with either active tDCS or sham tDCS. Once the SLT is completed, the participant will complete round 2 of outcome testing (i.e., post-testing for 1st SLT phase and pre-testing for 2nd SLT phase). Then, the participant will complete another 2 weeks of SLT but with the other tDCS condition. Once SLT is completed, the participant will complete round 3 of outcome testing (i.e., post-testing for 2nd SLT phase). Lastly, the participant will complete round 4 of outcome testing (i.e., follow-up)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Active tDCS versus sham tDCS will be masked to the participants","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active tDCS (with Speech-Language Treatment)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"tDCS Stimulation Dose: 1.5 mA for 20-mins","interventionNames":["Device: Active Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation with SLT"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS (with Speech-Language Treatment)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"No tDCS stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation with SLT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation with SLT","description":"Soterix Medical 1Ã—1 transcranial Direct Current Stimulator for Clinical Trials (1x1 tDCS-CT).\n\nExcitatory stimulation to the left hemisphere will be achieved through a 1x1 montage utilizing two carbon-rubber electrodes and 5x7 EASY pad sponges (A-tDCS \\[excitatory\\]left target; C-tDCS \\[inhibitory\\]right hemisphere).
