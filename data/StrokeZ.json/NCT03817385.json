Nowadays, utilizing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and robotic machines to assist walking training for stroke patients has been applied to clinic widely. While less studies have compared intervention efficacy for stroke patients between rTMS and robotic training. This study aimed to compare effect of rTMS and robotic training for lower-extremity function and gait in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study will include subjects occurring stroke within 3 months. All groups will receive traditional rehabilitation. The subjects will be allocated randomly in three groups which are traditional rehabilitation (Group A), robotic training (Group B), and rTMS (Group C) respectively, with 35 people per group. The group B will be intervened 5 times per week and the group C will receive 10 times rTMS intervention during 4 weeks. At post-intervention and eighth weeks after intervention, basic examination will be executed including basic information, history, Mini-mental State examination, Short -Form 36, Modified Ashworth Scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment, static and dynamic motion examination, ultrasound assessment and examination of cardiorespiratory. Two-way mixed ANOVA will be used to analyze the differences of three groups and times."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Transcranial magnetic stimulation","Robotic gait
