The French National Authority for Health recommends Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) either in combination with Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT), or alone, after failure of IVT or in case of contraindication to IVT, within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe objective is to determine the factors predicting good functional recovery at 3 months in order to establish the typical profile of the \"good responder\" patient to MT and to evaluate functional recovery at 3 and 12 months (mRS ≤ 2) according to the modality of MT (depending on whether it is performed during the day or at night), the age of the patients, the equipment used for MT, the type of anaesthesia, as well as the impact of the metrics from the radiological evaluation in the patient's management. patient management.","detailedDescription":"The management of cerebral infarction (CI) is a real public health issue. There are 120,000 hospitalizations of CI patients per year in France. It is the leading cause of acquired disability and the second leading cause of dementia. Since 2015, the scientific community has demonstrated the benefits of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in the treatment of patients with CI. The French National Authority for Health (HAS) recommends MT either in combination with intravenous (IV) thrombolysis, or alone, after failure of IV thrombolysis or in case of contraindication to IV thrombolysis, within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\nBased on previous studies, the HAS has extended its recommendations for the treatment of patients (with occlusion of large vessels of the anterior cerebral circulation) whose onset of symptoms or last seen asymptomatic is between 6 and 16 hours, and may even extend up to 24 hours depending on strict inclusion criteria.\n\nThese previous clinical trials have shown the remarkable efficacy of MT in CI patients under the age of 80. There are no clear recommendations for MT in patients over 80 years of age, and further research is needed to improve the safety of MT.\n\nFurther research is needed to improve patient selection in the elderly. Today, predictive factors impacting on functional recovery such as age, blood glucose, and NIHSS neurological severity score have been evaluated. However, no association between these factors during the course of treatment has been established to determine the clinical and radiological characteristics that define the standard profile of \"good responders\" to MT.\n\nThe cohort is a continuation of the data previously collected in a database of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL). This database reports a complete follow-up (clinical, imaging and MT procedure data) of patients, from admission to 3 months after their hospitalisation. Some results have already been published."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic
