Thrombolysis failure by the administration of rt-PA is frequent, in particular in proximal occlusion. Experimental studies suggest that neutrophils could play an important role in the thrombus development via the organization of a network (NET) within the thrombus. Targeting this network of NET could, in addition to the fibrinolysis, increase the rate of recanalisation and thus improve the neurological prognostic after a cerebral infarct.\n\nThe aim of the research is to Study of the biochemical and histological composition of the stemming thrombi of cerebral thrombectomies with in vitro analysis of the sensibility in the thrombolysis induced by rt-PA +/- Desoxyribonuclease I (DNase I)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarct"],"keywords":["Neutrophil Extracellular Traps"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":125,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation coefficient between biochemical and histological composition of the thrombus and the sensibility in the in vitro fibrinolysis and the origin of the thrombus.","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient over 18\n* Having a cerebral infarct consecutive to a wide calibre arterial occlusion\n* taken care for mechanical thrombectomy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient benefiting from a legal protective measure\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding woman\n* Opposition of the patient to participate in the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Cerebral infact after wide calibre arterial occlusion","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Arturo CONSOLI, MD","affiliation":"Hopital Foch","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Bertrand LAPERGUE, MD","affiliation":"Hopital Foch","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hopital Foch","city":"Suresnes","zip":"92150","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.87143,"lon":2.22929}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarct","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","asFound":"Cerebral Ischemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
