During these 6 months there will be 2 clinical follow up visits, one telephone control and one visit to evaluate compliance regarding medication.","detailedDescription":"Design TALOS is an investigator-initiated, national multicenter randomized- and placebo-controlled, double blind trial testing citalopram in acute ischemic stroke.\n\nRandomization Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either citalopram or placebo. Treatment allocation is double-blinded based on computer-generated algorithm via a dedicated website. Patients whose treatment is stopped within 31 days after inclusion will be replaced.\n\nIntervention and follow-up Patients randomized to citalopram will receive oral treatment with 20 mg tablets (10 mg if age ≥65 and/or reduced liver function) for 6 months with telephone contact after 2 weeks and 3 months and follow-up visits at 1 and 6 months. If patients develop depression dosage is initially doubled, followed by an additional control to evaluate effect and, if necessary, shifted to open-label antidepressant treatment. After 6 months, treatment will either stop or switch to open-label antidepressants at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nSubstudy 120 of patients will begin treatment within 12 hours after treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. These patients will receive a standard acute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with additional perfusion and angio sequences. The 24-hour control scan will be done using MRI instead of conventional CT.\n\nData monitoring When 300 patients have been included in the trial, an interim analysis will be performed. The unblinded results of this analysis will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Stroke","SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)","Serotonin","5-HT (5-Hydroxytryptamine)","Neuroprotection","MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)","Platelet","CT (computerized tomography)","Post Stroke Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":642,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention Drug: Citalopram","interventionNames":["Drug: Citalopram"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention Drug: Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Citalopram","description":"Citalopram 10-40 mg per day administered orally","armGroupLabels":["Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"],"otherNames":["Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors","SSRI","Seropram®","Cipramil®"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"1/2-2 tablets per day with no intrinsic drug activity","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["inactive drug","inactive medicine","inactive substance"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Vascular death, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)/stroke and myocardial infarction (combined)","description":"Myocardial Infarction: STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) and NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Functional status at 6-months","description":"Functional status at 6-months, measured by the modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Vascular death","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Death of any cause","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"TIA/stroke","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Bleeding","description":"Using the Global Utilization Of Streptokinase And Tpa For Occluded Arteries definition for bleeding (GUSTO)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","description":"STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) and NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Disability/dependence","description":"Using the modified Rankin Scale and the Barthel Index (BI)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Physical activity","description":"Using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Cognitive and organic cerebral impairment","description":"Using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Fatigue","description":"Using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Post-stroke depression","description":"Using the Major Depression Inventory test (MDI), Global depression scale (self and clinician and Hamilton Depression Scale -
