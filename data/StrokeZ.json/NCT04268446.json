Balance assessment systems test (BESTest) The balance assessment systems test developed by Horak consists of 6 sub-sections that evaluate the systems related to balance; 1) biomechanical limitations, 2) stability limit, 3) postural responses, 4) intuitive postural adjustments, 5) sensory orientation and 6) walking. It consists of 36 tests in total. Each question is rated between 0-3. The highest score that can be obtained is 108. Low test scores show that the balance is disturbed. BESTest has been found to be reliable among raters evaluating a cohort of individuals with and without various neurological diagnoses. In studies conducted, it was stated that BESTest is reliable when compared to other scales evaluating balance.\n\nThe necessary permissions have been obtained from the authors for Short BESTest, whose validity and reliability features will be tested, and the translation process to Turkish has been completed and the survey has been finalized. The basis for the use of special tools such as the scale is to prove the usability of the tool in the sample group to which it will be applied. The first step for this is the translation stage from the original language to the other language.\n\nAt the stage of translation into Turkish, two experts who knew a good level of English translated the questionnaire from English into Turkish. These translations have been translated back into Turkish by two native speakers of English and distant medical subjects. In addition, these translations were re-examined by the researchers and turned into a single form. This form was sent to five specialists in the field, checking the content and compliance with Turkish was evaluated. With the opinion of experts, the scale was finalized.\n\nThe study will include individuals over 40 years of age who have been diagnosed with an ischemic or hemorhagic stroke, who applied to the Kırıkkale University Faculty of Medicine Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["brief BESTest","stroke patients","Turkish version"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Test","description":"It is a 14-item scale that evaluates the tasks used in daily life activities.Standing up without support, standing without support, sitting without support, standing up, transfers, standing with feet, standing with legs while standing, reaching out while standing, picking up from the ground, looking back, 360 degree rotation, firm side standing on the stool, one foot standstill and standstill functions are evaluated.Each item is planned between 0-4; 0 is unable to fulfill the task, 4 is to fulfill the task successfully. The total score of the test is between 0-56.0-20 points: wheelchair dependent, 21-40: assisted walking, 41-56: means independent ambulation.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Functional Reach Test","description":"Subjects will asked to stand comfortably, to make a fist, and to raise their arm until it was parallel to the yardstick (position 1). The placement of the end of the third metacarpal along the yardstick will recorded. Subjects will then asked to reach as far forward as they could without losing their balance (position 2), and the position of the end of the third metacarpal along the yardstick will again recorded. No attempt will make to control the subject's method of reach, but if he will touch the wall or took a step during the maneuver, that trial will consider invalid and repeated.","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"Time Up and Go Test","description":"This test is applied to assess the risk of falling and mobility.This test starts with the individual leaving the chair without receiving arm support by giving the go command while sitting in a chair.The distance of 3 meters is asked to return and sit again in the chair.The elapsed time is recorded in seconds.","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"10 Meter Walk Tests","description":"Walking speed are measure by timing subjects over 10 meters with a stopwatch.
