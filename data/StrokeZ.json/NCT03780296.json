The prototype used is still in the early developing stage. The purpose of this research study is to develop a prototype of altered Microsoft Kinect Software and determine its use in improving the function of the study subjects' weaker extremities. The altered software will allow a viewing of the mirror image of the involved limb as it is moved. However, the image that is viewed will reflect normal movement even if the limb cannot move normally. By viewing normal movement of the weaker limbs the \"mirror neuron\" network in the brain will become activated and will ultimately improve the function of the weaker side."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke","Hemiplegia","Hemiparesis","Paralysis"],"keywords":["Kinect","Rehabilitation","Virtual reality","Mirror therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single group pre-test/post-test design","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real-Time Action Observation with augmented Kinect","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 30 minutes of the augmented kinect software in real-time undergoing an exercise protocol involving seated upper extremity exercises, seated lower extremity exercises and standing upper extremity exercises.","interventionNames":["Device: Real-time action observation with augmented Kinect"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Real-time action observation with augmented Kinect","description":"Participants will receive 30 minutes of the augmented kinect software in real-time undergoing an exercise protocol involving seated upper extremity exercises, seated lower extremity exercises and standing upper extremity exercises.","armGroupLabels":["Real-Time Action Observation with augmented Kinect"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Motor Activity Log (MAL)","description":"MAL measures participants overall use or increased use and quality of use of affected upper limb","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Change in 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT)","description":"9 HPT is a timed standardized measure participants overall function of dexterity.","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Change in 10 Meter Walk Test (10mWT)","description":"The 10mWT is a standardized measure used to assess participants timed walking speed in meters per second over a short distance","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Change in Functional Reach Test (FRT)","description":"The functional reach test is a standardized measure assessing the participants ability to reach forward with unaffected arm","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Change in Timed Up and Go (TUG)","description":"The TUG is a standardized measure which assesses participants mobility, balance, walking ability, and fall risk in older adults","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Change in 5 Time Sit to Stand (5xSS)","description":"This is a standardized measure assessing participants functional lower limb strength.","timeFrame":"5 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* -
