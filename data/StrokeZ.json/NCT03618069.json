After a first stroke, there is a significant risk of recurrence (around 5-10% over the first year). While there are benefits from addressing general risk factors such as exercise, weight and smoking, selecting the best treatments for preventing a further stroke depends on understanding the underlying mechanism. Most strokes results from a blood clot causing a blockage in a blood vessel in the brain (\"ischaemic\" strokes, about 85% of cases). The clot may originate in the heart, the major blood vessels supplying the head, or result from disease of the small blood vessels in the brain itself (around 25% of cases each), and in around 25% of people a cause cannot be determined (sometimes because more than one exists). Different treatments are given depending on cause (for example, anticoagulant medication for clots from the heart, surgery for some arising from large arteries in the neck).\n\nCurrent investigations involve multiple tests spread across different hospital departments, and commonly take several weeks to be completed. This may contribute to a high rate of strokes of uncertain cause, and may delay the start of the best treatment.\n\nThis trial will investigate the value of a single comprehensive scan to look at the heart and major blood vessels (using CT scanning) in a pilot study, comparing the classification of causes of stroke and the time to starting treatments with routine care, in a randomised study of patients with recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA, a short-lived stroke episode)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischaemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"routine investigation","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"},{"label":"study protocol CCI (CTA, cardiac CT) and MRI scans","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: CCI scanning (CTA, cardiac CT), and MRI scanning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"CCI scanning (CTA, cardiac CT), and MRI scanning","description":"Scanning","armGroupLabels":["study protocol CCI (CTA, cardiac CT) and MRI scans"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patient with stroke of uncertain aetiology by ASCO system classification by day 30.
