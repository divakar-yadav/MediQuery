Device as single Microsoft sensor Kinect v2, wearable sensorized clothing and/or smartphone-type devices will be used; it is also planned to analyze and compare such parameters with those obtained through a technique of manual palpatory analysis. Finally the obtained measures will be compared with the corresponding ones obtained with Three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis (3D-GA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae","Hemiparesis","Gait Disorders, Neurologic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hemiparetic patients","description":"Hemiparetic patients assessed during gait and stance performance by means of different instrumental tools (smart and portable device vs 3D laboratory gait analysis) in order to evidence gait pattern; kinematics, kinetics and spatio-temporal data.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Movement analysis"]},{"label":"Healthy age matched subjects","description":"Healthy age matched subjects assessed during gait and stance performance by means of different instrumental tools (smart and portable device vs 3D laboratory gait analysis) in order to evidence gait pattern; kinematics, kinetics and spatio-temporal data.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Movement analysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Movement analysis","description":"Qualitative and quantitative computerized and instrumental assessment of gait and posture.","armGroupLabels":["Healthy age matched subjects","Hemiparetic patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"GPS (Gait Profile Score index) - differences between techniques","description":"% of agreement between 3D-GA (3 dimensional Gait Analysis - optoelectronic system) and Kinect motion analysis in the detection of kinematic data about gait collected within the GPS (Gait Profile Score Index)","timeFrame":"During movement analysis"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait cycle values (stance and swing duration) - differences between techniques","description":"% of agreement between 3D-GA (3 dimensional Gait Analysis - optoelectronic system) and Kinect motion analysis in the detection of Gait cycle values (stance and swing duration)","timeFrame":"During movement analysis"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient with post-stroke chronic hemiparesis (at least 6 month post-acute event)\n* ability to stand erect for 30 seconds\n* ability to walk with or without aids for 10 meters\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Moderate/severe cognitive impairment (MMSE \\< 22)\n* Moderate/severe depression (Hamilton Depression Scale \\> 20)\n* Severe spasticity","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Single laboratory movement analysis with different tools and tecniques","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Matteo Bigoni, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+390323514445","email":"m.bigoni@auxologico.it"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Matteo Bigoni, MD","affiliation":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Milan","zip":"20145","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Matteo Bigoni, MD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.46427,"lon":9.18951}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020233","term":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21748","name":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic","asFound":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
