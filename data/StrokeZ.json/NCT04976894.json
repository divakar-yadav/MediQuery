This study is designed as a 10-year, longitudinal follow-up investigating the residual disabilities, activity limitations, and quality of life issues arising in patients suffering from first-ever stroke as previous similar stroke cohort with KOSCO. The main objectives of this study are to identify and compare the factors that influence residual disability and long-term quality of life in first-ever acute stroke patients with KOSCO. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine and compare the risk of mortality and recurrent vascular events in first-ever acute stroke patients with KOSCO. Investigators will investigate longitudinal health behaviors and patterns of healthcare utilization, including stroke rehabilitation care. Investigators will also investigate the long-term health status, mood, and quality of life in stroke patient caregivers. In addition, investigators will identify baseline and ongoing characteristics that are associated with secondary outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Disability","Function","Rehabilitation","Burden"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2431,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"open","description":"open"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Korean modified Barthel Index","description":"measurement for activities of daily living Minimum: 0, Maximum: 100 Higher scores means a better.","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset."},{"measure":"Change in Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimensions measurement for quality of life","description":"measurement for quality of life Minimum: 0, Maximum: 1 Higher scores means a better.","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset."},{"measure":"Change in Functional Independence Measurement","description":"measurement for activities of daily living Minimum: 0, Maximum: 126 Higher scores means a better.","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset."},{"measure":"Change in Korean Mini-Mental State Examination","description":"measurement for language function Minimum: 0, Maximum: 30 Higher scores means a better.","timeFrame":"7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset."},{"measure":"Change in Korean Version of Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test","description":"measurement for language function Minimum: 0, Maximum: 30 Higher scores means a better.","timeFrame":"7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months, 84 months, 96 months, 108 months after stroke onset."},{"measure":"Change in modified Rankin Scale","description":"Measurement for disability.
