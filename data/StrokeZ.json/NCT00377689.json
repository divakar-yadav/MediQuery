This tend to restrict the persons activity in daily life and also leads to a low falls self efficacy.\n\nHigh intensity exercise have shown to be effective for improving strength and balance for older people in general living in residential care facilities. It is interesting to see if this high intensity exercise also is applicable in the older stroke population.\n\nComparison: An intervention group receives three training sessions per week and one theory session per week during 5 weeks, compared to a control group that receives one theory session per week during 5 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Musculoskeletal Equilibrium"],"keywords":["Accidental falls","Cerebrovascular accident","Balance","ADL","Self efficacy","Quality of Life","Gait parameters"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"high intensity functional exercise","description":"high intensity functional exercise"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Improvement in balance","timeFrame":"post, 3 & 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reduced falls","timeFrame":"post, 3 & 6 months"},{"measure":"Improved self-efficacy","timeFrame":"post, 3 & 6 months"},{"measure":"Improved ADL","timeFrame":"post, 3 & 6 months"},{"measure":"Improved walking ability","timeFrame":"post, 3 & 6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 55 years of age or older\n* stroke diagnosis 3-6 months prior to inclusion\n* ability to walk 10 meter with or without assistive device\n* ability to understand simple instructions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* TIA\n* independent in walking outdoors\n* serious visual impairment\n* serious hearing impairment\n* long distance to intervention station","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Eva Holmgren, PhD student","affiliation":"Umeå University & The Vårdal Institute","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Per Wester, MD Professor","affiliation":"Umeå University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Umeå University, department of Community science and rehabilitation","city":"Umeå","zip":"90137","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":63.82842,"lon":20.25972}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
