Given the known interactions and interconnectivity of cognitive domains required for optimal cognitive functioning post-stroke, a systematic review of 64 studies addressing all types of non-pharmacological rehabilitation interventions which may improve multiple cognitive domains in people post-stroke was conducted. Within this review, rehabilitation interventions were categorised as multicomponent interventions, physical activity interventions, cognitive rehabilitation interventions, NIBS protocols, occupational-based interventions and other interventions. The most consistent evidence in our systematic review and meta-analysis supported multicomponent interventions, with significant improvement demonstrated for general cognitive function and memory outcomes. Specifically, multicomponent interventions wherein a form of cognitive rehabilitation was conducted in conjunction with a form of physical activity were shown to improve cognitive functioning in people post-stroke.\n\nAs well as meta-analytic evidence, we drew from qualitative findings which explored the perspectives of PpS, caregivers and healthcare professionals on the design and delivery of an intervention to improve cognitive functioning in PpS. Qualitative findings and input from clinical experts emphasised the importance of information provision, peer support and meaningful engagement. As such, each component of OptiCogs Online is supplemented with an educational or 'cognitive education' session wherein group discussion covers different aspects of cognitive functioning. As well as drawing on findings from our qualitative study, this 'cognitive education' component is underpinned by the Bridges stroke self-management package and based on self-efficacy principles.\n\nTo this end, a complex multicomponent intervention comprising of cognitive, physical activity and educational components was developed in line with the MRC framework."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Cardiovascular","Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["Feasibility","Stroke","Cognitive impairment","Multicomponent rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"A non-randomised single-arm feasibility study using a pre-test: post-test design.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"OptiCogs Online is a 6-week telehealth intervention consisting of cognitive, physical activity and educational components.
