Fatigue is different from post-stroke depression and the more serious stroke patients are more prone to fatigue（Windward et al., 2009）.\n\nFatigue is one of the symptoms of qi deficiency,and Astragalus membranaceus is the most effective of all traditional Chinese medicine and can tonifying middle and tonify the original qi. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Astragalus membranaceus on post-stroke fatigue."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fatigue","Stroke"],"keywords":["After stroke with fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chinese Herb Astragalus membranaceus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Chinese Herb Astragalus membranaceus"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chinese Herb Astragalus membranaceus","description":"Astragalus membranaceus(AM)at a rate of 2.8g three times per day","armGroupLabels":["Chinese Herb Astragalus membranaceus"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"at a rate of 2.8g three times per day","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EORTC QLQ-C30","timeFrame":"2 year(all patients)"},{"measure":"BFI-T score","timeFrame":"2 years(all patients)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"SF-36 score","timeFrame":"2 years(all patients)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
