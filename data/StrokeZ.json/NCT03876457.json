Patient outcomes will be measured at baseline, 24 hours post, discharge, 30 days and 90 days.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 (+/- 15) days. The primary outcome is a shift on 90-day mRS. Secondary outcomes are favorable clinical outcomes: mRS score of 0-2, safety outcomes such the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH per SITS-MOST) and Imaging endpoints such as infarct volume on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence (or CT if MRI not feasible) 24 to 72 hours after randomization. CT images will be read by iSchemaView automated ASPECTS as well as by a physician. In cases where there is disagreement, the physician reading will override the automated software reading. CT/MR perfusion images with mismatch determination will be read by iSchemaView automated RAPID software. All the images will be adjudicated by a blinded core lab at the University of Texas-Medical School at Houston.\n\nA maximum of 560 patients will be randomized across the study sites. Covariate adaptive randomization will be used to balance the distribution of important variables. Interim analyses will be conducted at 200 and 380 patients, at which time the study may stop for efficacy or futility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Large vessel occlusion","Endovascular thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":352,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular Thrombectomy plus Medical Management","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Endovascular Thrombectomy","Other: Medical Management"]},{"label":"Medical Management","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Medical Management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Endovascular Thrombectomy","description":"Patients randomized to endovascular thrombectomy arm will receive thrombectomy plus medical management.
