However, CHOICE was a phase-2 trial and almost exclusively enrolled anterior circulation occlusions. Therefore, data on the safety and efficacy of post-endovascular reperfusion IAT in posterior circulation stroke is lacking.\n\nIn general, anterior circulation strokes are associated with a higher risk of ICH than posterior circulation strokes. Therefore, we believe it might be safer to perform post-endovascular reperfusion IAT posterior circulation stroke. Also, there are more perforator artery in the posterior circulation, IAT would be more likely to show its benefit. Therefore, we would like to explore IA rt-PA for posterior circulation stroke after successful MT in our RCT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Arterial Thrombosis","Posterior Circulation Brain Infarction"],"keywords":["Intra-arterial thrombolysis","Alteplase","Large vessel occlusion","Mechanical thrombectomy","Endovascular treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":376,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Successful mechanical thrombectomy plus intra-arterial alteplase group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For patients in the successful MT plus intra-arterial alteplase group, after successful recanalization, neurointerventionalists administered intra-arterial thrombolysis with alteplase according to protocol.
