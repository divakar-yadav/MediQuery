Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) will be treated on cerebral infarction patients, and evaluates their neurological function of convalescent period.","detailedDescription":"40 participants will be selected based on eligibility criteria and collected information, then, randomly separated into two groups. All participants will sign informed consent form, monitor vital signs, laboratory examination (CT/MRI, blood routine examination, urine routine examination, liver function, renal function, etc.), NIHSS, Fugl-Meyer analysis (FMA) 0-3 days before treatment. All of them will receive basic treatment with Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets and Atorvastatin Calcium. And experimental group will treat with hUC-MSC, control group with placebo (normal saline) on the 7th and 14th day. After the treatment, investigator will follow-up, monitor vital signs, laboratory examination, NIHSS, FMA analysis on 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months after the treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["cerebral Infarction","umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Basic medication：Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets \\& Atorvastatin Calcium； Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells","interventionNames":["Biological: Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell","Drug: Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets & Atorvastatin Calcium"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Basic medication：Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets \\& Atorvastatin Calcium; Placebo：saline","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets & Atorvastatin Calcium"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell","description":"Experimental group receive Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell，i.v (SCLnow 19#)","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets & Atorvastatin Calcium","description":"Aspirin Enteric-coated Tablets, 0.1g/d by mouth; Atorvastatin Calcium, 20mg/d by mouth.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor function analysis","description":"Based on Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) to analysis efficacy of cell treatment.The score of patient with upper limb \\>60, and total score \\>90 is considered good recovery.","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological deficits analysis","description":"According to Chinese scale of clinical neurologic deficit to analysis, the result as follow:\n\n* Excellent: after treatment, patient with consciousness, and clinical symptoms improved;\n* Effective: vital signs and main symptoms in remission;\n* Inefficient: no obvious improvement or condition worsened.","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Limb motor function analysis","description":"Using fugl-meyer assessment evaluate motor function.
