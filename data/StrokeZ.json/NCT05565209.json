This risk justifies first-line prescribing of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy in these patients. Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure, is an interventional cardiology technique for patients at high risk of stroke related to atrial fibrillation in whom long term anticoagulation therapy cannot be conducted. This procedure involves implantation of an occlusion device into the left atrial appendage to close it and prevent migration of thrombotic material that could otherwise cause distant embolism. Closure of the left atrial appendage avoids long-term prescription of anticoagulants while protecting patients against the risk of systemic embolism and stroke.\n\nHypothesis/Objective: the main objective of this study is to assess the long term efficacy of left atrial closure, 5 years after the procedure Method: 150 patients will be included prospectively. We will also include restropectively100 other patients, previously treated by left atrial appendage closure at Henri Mondor hospital. Demographic, clinical, echocardiographic, and computed tomography data will be obtained by physical examination or medical records.\n\nConclusion: this study will allow to assess the long term efficacy of left atrial closure in atrial fibrillation patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation, Left atrial appendage closure, stroke, anticoagulation, bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"SA brief descriptive name used to refer to the intervention(s) studied","description":"Details that can be made public about the intervention"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency of thrombo-embolic events","description":"The primary efficacy endpoint is the frequency of a combined endpoint including ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms after left atrial appendage closure.
