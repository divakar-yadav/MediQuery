BoNT-A injection combined with rehabilitation training is recommended to enhance functional recovery of patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke.\n\nPatients with spasticity usually have lower motor function and worse sensory deficits than patients without spasticity. Designing the post BoNT-A injection rehabilitation program should consider the above issues. RT and MT are two interventions providing sensorimotor input for patient with low motor function. Combining both approaches (wearing robotic hand to do mirror therapy) might facilitate the sensorimotor cortex that controls movement and might augment somatosensory input and further treatment efficacy. It is unknown whether and how combining BoNT injection with bilateral RT vs with MT vs with RMT engenders differential effects on motor and related functional performance in patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke.\n\nForty-eight participants with chronic spastic hemiplegic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: RT, and RMT. All the post- injection interventions will be implemented 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 8 weeks. At each training session all patients will receive 45-minute RT, or RMT, then 15-minute functional task training.\n\nThe outcome measures include 1) body function and structures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Modified Ashworth Scale, Medical Research Council scale, 2) activity and participation: Box and block test, Motor Activity Log, and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale, Action Research Arm Test. In addition, to directly reflect a patient's unique needs and goals, Goal Attainment Scaling will be assessed. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) assessments will be done to assess the neurophysiologic effects of the 3 kinds of intervention. The outcome will be measured at pre-treatment,1-week after BoNT-A injection, post-treatment, and 3-month follow- up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia, Spastic","Spastic"],"keywords":["Stroke rehabilitation","Spasticity","Botulinum toxin type A injection","Mirror therapy","Robot"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"There will be a research code representing patients' identity, this code will not show patients' name, social security number, and home address.
