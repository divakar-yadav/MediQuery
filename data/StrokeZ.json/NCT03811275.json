The two interventions include a task-based intervention and a virtual reality intervention that provides a reflected image of the involved arm. The task-based intervention will consist of setting up activities of interest to be done using the involved arm and structuring practice and meaningful feedback to assist learning. The virtual reality intervention will consist of the person wearing the virtual reality device and practicing virtual tasks using the intact arm while seeing the involved arm. Intervention sessions will last approximately 30 minutes and will be held 3 times/week for 3 weeks each for a total of 9 sessions for each intervention. Testing of the involved arm's function will be done before the interventions, after receiving 9 sessions of each intervention, and one month after completing the second intervention received.","detailedDescription":"Potential participants will be screened for age, history of stroke, brain injury, or cerebral palsy, and having one functional arm and one poorly functioning arm by phone. Those who meet the basic criteria will be scheduled for an Intake Evaluation consisting of obtaining voluntary informed consent, complete a demographic survey, visual field testing, cognitive screening, perceptual testing, and an arm/hand function test. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a Preliminary Evaluation.\n\nThe Preliminary Evaluation will measure the current motor control ability, perception of level of disability, and amount of active and passive motion in the involved arm.\n\nParticipants will participate in the first form of intervention (randomly assigned) for three 30 minute sessions per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions) and be re-evaluated using the same tests conducted during the Preliminary Evaluation with the addition of the arm/hand function test conducted during the initial screening.\n\nParticipants will participate in the second form of intervention for three 30 minute sessions per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions) and be re-evaluated using the same tests conducted following the first intervention.\n\nOne month after completing the second form of intervention, participants will be re-evaluated using the same tests used following the second intervention and will also receive a semi-structured interview regarding their thoughts and experiences during the study and their perceptions of the outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Paresis","Hemiplegia and/or Hemiparesis Following Stroke","Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy"],"keywords":["upper extremity recovery of function","action observation","virtual reality","task-based intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"All participants will receive both interventions (A and B) and will be randomly assigned to the sequence in which they receive them (AB or BA).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The occupational therapist providing all of the functional assessments will be blinded to sequence of interventions provided.","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sequence #1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive nine 30 minute sessions (over 3 weeks) of intervention A followed by nine 30 minute sessions (over 3 weeks) of intervention B.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Virtual Reality (A) then Task (B)"]},{"label":"Sequence #2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive nine 30 minute sessions (over 3 weeks) of intervention B followed by nine 30 minute sessions (over 3 weeks) of intervention B.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Task (B) then Virtual Reality (A)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Virtual Reality (A) then Task (B)","description":"Participants will use their intact arm to perform virtual reality tasks while perceiving a reflected virtual image of their paretic arm.","armGroupLabels":["Sequence #1"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Task (B) then Virtual Reality (A)","description":"Participants will use their paretic arm to perform real tasks in a structured environment, with a practice and feedback schedule organized by a physical or occupational therapist, or graduate student.","armGroupLabels":["Sequence #2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE portion)","description":"Performance-based measure of arm impairment post stroke;
