However, there is lack of high-quality evidence of its efficacy for acute ischemic stroke currently. The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Chinese herbal therapeutic regimen of EPACH+NQABC combined with guideline-based standard treatment will improve the 15-day neurological deficits in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Totally 500 participants will be randomized to the integrative treatment group treated with EPACH + NQABC recipes granules in addition to guideline-based standard treatment or the control group with placebo and guideline-based standard treatment equally for 15 days. All patients will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) entry score of 4-25. Patients in each group will be treated according to guideline-based standard treatment, but patients who have received or intend to undergo intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular interventions (including intravascular mechanical thrombectomy, arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty) are excluded. The primary outcome will be determined at 15 days, and all the participants will be followed up for 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","neurologic impairment","integrative therapy","Chinese herbs","prospective randomized double-blind controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Integrative Treatment Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive EPACH and NQABC Chinese herbal compound granules, which will be manufactured by the Beijing Kangrentang Pharmaceutical company, combined with standard stroke care according to the Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China 2018.","interventionNames":["Drug: Integrative Treatment (EPACH Recipe Granules + NQABC Recipe Granules)"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomly assigned to the control group will receive recipe simulators as placebo, which will be manufactured by the Beijing Kangrentang Pharmaceutical company, combined with standard stroke care according to the Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China 2018.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Integrative Treatment (EPACH Recipe Granules + NQABC Recipe Granules)","description":"Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive EPACH and NQABC Chinese herbal compound granules, which will be manufactured by the Beijing Kangrentang Pharmaceutical company, combined with standard stroke care according to the Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China 2018.\n\nRoute of administration: oral.\n\nDose regimen:\n\nDay 1 to Day 5: in addition to the guideline-based standard treatment, 7.35g of EPACH recipe granules, dissolved with 200ml of boiled water, twice a day.\n\nDay 6 to Day 15: in addition to the guideline-based standard treatment, 6.85g of NQABC recipe granules, dissolved with 200ml of boiled water, twice a day.","armGroupLabels":["Integrative Treatment Group"],"otherNames":["EPACH Recipe Granules + NQABC Recipe Granules"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive recipe simulators as placebo.
