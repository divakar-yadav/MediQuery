To test this, we will target recruitment of acute ischemic stroke patients who present to the ED within 12 hours of symptoms onset. Enrolled subjects will receive continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring contemporaneous with measurements of cerebral blood flow velocities and cerebral oximetry."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","transcranial doppler","cerebral blood flow","cardiac output","non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in cerebral blood flow velocities","description":"Cerebral flow velocities determined by bilateral MCA measurements by TCD","timeFrame":"initial 24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Suspected ischemic stroke within 12 hours of symptom onset\n* NIHSS â‰¥ 4\n* Age 18 to 90 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Baseline modified Rankin Scale \\> 3\n* Pregnancy\n* Intracranial hemorrhage on head CT\n* Mechanical ventilation prior to enrollment\n* Inadequate temporal windows for TCD analysis","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute (\\< 12 hours) ischemic stroke patients presenting to the Emergency Department","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Henry Ford Hospital","city":"Detroit","state":"Michigan","zip":"48202","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.33143,"lon":-83.04575}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
