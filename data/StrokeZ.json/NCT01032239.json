Patients will be equally randomized to one of two treatment arms:\n\n1. ITB Therapy arm; or\n2. BMT arm\n\nThe study consists of a run-in phase of 21 days for the BMT treatment arm and 2-25 days for the ITB Therapy treatment arm, followed by a 6 month active trial.\n\nThe BMT treatment arm will receive a combination of oral antispastic medication and physiotherapy. Patients must be prescribed at least one or a combination of the following oral antispastic medications: oral baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam (or other benzodiazepines) or dantrolene. Following the run-in phase, patients will enter the 6 month active trial.\n\nThe ITB Therapy treatment arm will receive a combination of ITB Therapy and physiotherapy. During the run-in phase, a test with intrathecal baclofen will be performed to evaluate the response of the patient. Patients fulfilling the test success criterium will be implanted with a Medtronic SynchroMedÂ®II infusion system. Following implant, patients will enter into the 6 month active trial, which includes a 6 week titration phase, during which time oral antispastic medications must be gradually reduced with complete discontinuation by the end of the titration period.\n\nDuring the 6 month active trial, patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months. All primary and secondary endpoint assessments will be performed by a blinded assessor.\n\nThe total study duration is expected to be 60 months, including a 39 month enrollment period. The total duration per patient is approximately 7 months (approximately 1 month run-in period followed by 6 months active treatment)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Spasticity"],"keywords":["Severe spasticity in post-stroke patients"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ITB therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intrathecal Baclofen therapy (Intrathecal baclofen + implantable pump)","interventionNames":["Drug: intrathecal baclofen"]},{"label":"Best Medical Treatment (BMT)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Use one or a combination oral antispastic medication."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"intrathecal baclofen","description":"ITB test, implant, 6 months follow-up","armGroupLabels":["ITB therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Average Ashworth Scale (AS) in Affected Lower Extremities From Baseline to Month 6","description":"AS is a manual test, measuring the resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity.
