Previous basic research has confirmed that hypothermia can significantly reduce the infarct volume and improve the survival rate and behavioral defects of mice by protecting ischemic brain tissue and improving reperfusion injury through a variety of ways. Therefore, we hypothesized that hypothermia can improve the prognosis of patients with AIS after reperfusion by improving reperfusion injury. This is a phase II clinical trial to to verify the efficacy and safety of endovascular hypothermia in these patients,This study enrolled patients with massive cerebral infarction after endovascular treatment recanalization, patients are divided into study group and control group. The study group received endovascular hypothermia for 12 hours following endovascular treatment and recanalization, and the control group received only usual medical treatment following endovascular treatment and recanalization. We will preliminarily explore the mechanism of endovascular hypothermia in successful reperfusion of large vessel occlusion AIS, and to provide reference for the design of future clinical trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Revascularization","Endovascular Treatment","Reperfusion Injury"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Revascularization","Endovascular Treatment","Reperfusion Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The subjects will be considered to be enrolled in the study group of the trial when all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met, the informed consent form has been signed, and randomization to the study group of the trial to allow endovascular therapy with the Thermogard XP3 Intravascular Temperature Management (IVTM) System after recanalization.","interventionNames":["Device: Thermogard XP3"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The subjects will be considered to be enrolled in the control group of the trial when all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met, the informed consent form has been signed, and randomization to the control group of the trial."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Thermogard XP3","description":"Patients received endovascular hypothermia for 12 hours following endovascular treatment and recanalization.","armGroupLabels":["Study group"],"otherNames":["intravascular hypothermia treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of study group patients achieving target temperature < 34 ºC within 2 hour after recanalization.","description":"Percentage of study group patients achieving target temperature \\< 34 ºC within 2 hour after recanalization.","timeFrame":"2 hour after thrombectomy"},{"measure":"final infarct volume（FIV）","description":"Infarct volume was assessed according to the non-contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) 3-7 days after surgery, and if several NCCT examinations were performed within 3-7 days, the last CT was used.","timeFrame":"three to seven days after endovascular therapy"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the rate of 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS)(0-2)","description":"Compare the rate of 90-day mRS (0-2) between study group and control group","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The rate of early neurological deterioration","description":"increasing of National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) ≥ 4 points 24 hours after recanalization","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"The rate of mortality","description":"The rate of mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Systematic Intracranial Hemorrhagr(sICH)","description":"sICH with 24 ±3h post recanalization","timeFrame":"24 ±3hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 18-80 years;\n* Patients with symptoms consistent with an AIS;\n* Pre-stroke mRS score 0-1;\n* NIHSS score 6-30 at the time of randomization;\n* Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) or Magnetic Resonance Angiography(MRA) proved occlusion of Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) terminal or M1 segment of Middle Cerebral Artery;\n* Imaging showed massive infarction: within 24h of onset and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) \\< 3, and large infarct core 70-100 ml (CT perfusion \\[ Relative Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) \\< 30%\\]);
