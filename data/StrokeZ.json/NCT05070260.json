IVT should mandatorily be used according to the approved dosing regimen as described in the product information/SmPC/USPI.\n\nEligible patients will be randomized and the infusion of glenzocimab or of its matching placebo should be administered as soon as possible but no later than two hours from the start of the thrombolytic agent administration. Transferring the patient to the catheterization room should not delay the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration.\n\nPatients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio allocation either to glenzocimab or placebo. Randomization will be minimized for factors as follows: (NIHSS \\<10 vs. ≥ 10), age group (\\<65, 65-79, ≥80 years), and type of thrombolytic agent (alteplase vs. tenecteplase) in order to balance each treatment group composition.\n\nThe allocation of each patient in all centers to an active treatment or placebo will strictly follow the central randomization scheme. Clinical supplies allocation to centers should provide the necessary material so that any eligible patient can receive the assigned treatment. A central randomization system (IRT - Interactive Response Technology) will be used to manage randomization/stratification and drug shipment. The whole process will be handled in a manner that it is blinded for the treatment received to all involved study personnel.\n\nThe IDMC will be composed of 5 independent members (at least 2 clinicians and 1 statistician).\n\nIDMC members will process the information and will issue their recommendations as per the IDMC Charter.\n\nOne interim analysis after 100 patients recruited and treated is planned for safety evaluation only.\n\nIn case of any urgent safety concern, ad-hoc meetings will be triggered."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Haemorrhages GPVI","Thrombolysis","Thrombectomy","Anti-platelet","glenzocimab","ACT017","stroke","GPVI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomized, double blind, multicenter, multinational, placebo controlled, parallel group, single dose, adaptive phase II/III study (respectively Part 1 and 2).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":438,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intravenous glenzocimab (ACT017) 1000 mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous glenzocimab (ACT017) 1000 mg to be added to thrombolysis +/- mechanical thrombectomy","interventionNames":["Drug: Intravenous glenzocimab (ACT017) 1000 mg"]},{"label":"Intravenous Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous Placebo to be added to thrombolysis +/- mechanical thrombectomy","interventionNames":["Drug: Intravenous Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intravenous glenzocimab (ACT017) 1000 mg","description":"Add-on therapy to the standard of Care in the treatment of the acute ischemic stroke symptoms","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous glenzocimab (ACT017) 1000 mg"],"otherNames":["Thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intravenous Placebo","description":"Add-on therapy to the standard of Care in the treatment of the acute ischemic stroke symptoms","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous Placebo"],"otherNames":["Thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Binary Poor Outcome on the mRS defined by a score of 4-6 (versions 0-3)","description":"To show the efficacy of glenzocimab vs. placebo, on the \"poor outcome\" defined as a mRS score of 4-6 (vs 0-3) assessed at Day 90","timeFrame":"Day 90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint - mRS","description":"Binary \"Favorable Outcome\" on the mRS defined by a score of 0-2 (versus 3-6)","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Mortality","description":"All cause mortality","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"mRS","description":"To assess the favorable responses defined as mRS score of 0-1","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"mRS","description":"To assess the favorable responses defined as mRS score of 5-6","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Ordinal mRS","description":"To assess the shift analysis","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Utility Weighted mRS","description":"To assess the utility weighted mRS (UW-mRS)","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"All cause mortality","description":"To assess all cause mortality","timeFrame":"72 hours"},{"measure":"ICHs","description":"Symptomatic and non-symptomatic ICHs","timeFrame":"72 hours"},{"measure":"Neurological Status Change as assessed by NIHSS value compared to pre-IVT value","description":"Response defined by a relative decrease (%) in NIHSS value at 24 hours compared to pre-IVT value higher than 30%.\n\nRelative change (%) in NIHSS value at 24 hrs compared to pre-IVT value","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Recanalization rate","description":"To assess recanalization in patients undergoing thrombectomy by eTICI score","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Cerebral tissue reperfusion","description":"To assess Cerebral tissue reperfusion","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Infarct volume progression and hemorrhagic transformation","description":"To assess the impact on follow up imaging (follow up infarct volume, infarct growth and volume of hemorrhagic transformation)","timeFrame":"24 hrs"},{"measure":"Measure of Quality of Life by EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L)","description":"Quality of Life as assessed by the EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level.
