In patients with acute neurological injury under mechanical ventilation, is there a correlation between the acute neurological injury, assessed using the Glasgow scale on admission, and baseline ventilatory parameters?\n2. In patients with acute neurological injury under mechanical ventilation, are the baseline ventilatory parameters altered at baseline?","detailedDescription":"Adults patients with acute neurological injury (ANI) secondary to stroke, brain trauma or subarachnoid hemorrhage may present extraneurological complications. They occur as a consequence of the release of inflammatory mediators in an altered blood-brain barrier, which reach the circulation and thus alter the functionality of other organs. Of the affected organs, the lung is the most frequently compromised, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and worse neurological outcomes. It should be noted that a large proportion of patients with ANI require mechanical ventilation (MV), which also through the production of inflammatory mediators, can lead to the development of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and alteration of other organs.\n\nFrom the above, it can be thought that in patients with ANI, the basal respiratory parameters could be altered and this is important, given that in this group of patients, the ventilatory parameters could generate changes at the brain level, particularly an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and variation in PaCO2 that would produce changes in the vasculature and concomitantly in cerebral blood flow. In turn, the use of protective ventilation, recommended in other pathologies such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is not clearly defined for this group of patients. For this reason, the objective of this study is the assessment of baseline ventilatory parameters in patients with ANI, in particular mechanical power (MP), mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight (MP/PBW) and driving pressure (DP) and to determine their association with the baseline neurological status (assessed through the Glasgow coma score). The hypothesis of the study, assuming that the greater the initial neurological damage, the greater the ventilatory alterations, is that MP correlates with the degree of neurological injury. The second hypothesis is that ventilatory variables, particularly MP, are altered at baseline in patients with LNA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Decompensation, Acute","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["acute neurological injury, mechanical ventilation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with acute neurological injury","description":"Patients ≥ 16 years of age with ANI requiring mechanical ventilation for neurological causes, without baseline lung injury, defined by a PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 300 and with a normal chest x-ray"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between acute neurological injury and mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight","description":"To determine the degree of correlation between acute neurological injury, assessed using the Glasgow coma score \\[GCS; with a score between 3 (worst score, most severe) and 15 (best score, least severe)\\] and mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight (Joules/minute/kilograms)","timeFrame":"The first 2 days of the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between acute neurological injury and mechanical power","description":"To determine the degree of correlation between acute neurological injury, assessed using the Glasgow coma score \\[GCS; with a score between 3 (worst score, most severe) and 15 (best score, least severe)\\] and mechanical power (Joules/minute)","timeFrame":"The first 2 days of the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV)"},{"measure":"Correlation between acute neurological injury and ΔP","description":"To determine the degree of correlation between acute neurological injury, assessed using the Glasgow coma score \\[GCS; with a score between 3 (worst score, most severe) and 15 (best score, least severe)\\] and ΔP (centimeter of water)","timeFrame":"The first 2 days of the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV)"},{"measure":"To assess respiratory parameters during the first two days of MV","description":"To assess the baseline ventilatory parameters: static pressure: Pplat (centimeter of water), respiratory system resistance: it is the relationship between the difference between peak pressure and static pressure with the inspiratory flow: R = (Ppeak-Pplat)/Inspiratory flow (centimeter of water/liters/second), driving pressure: it is the difference between static pressure and PEEP: ΔP = Pplat-PEEP (centimeter of water), static compliance: it is the relationship between tidal volume and ΔP (mililiters/centimeter of water), dynamic driving pressure: it is the difference between peak pressure and PEEP: ΔP = Ppeak-PEEP (centimeter of water), (centimeter of water), mechanical power (Joules/minute), mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight (Joules/minute/kilograms) and ventilatory ratio","timeFrame":"The first 2 days of the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV)"},{"measure":"To assess respiratory parameters during the first two days of MV, according to the different subgroups of ANI","description":"Assess respiratory parameters during the first two days of MV, according to the different subgroups of ANI: brain trauma injury (BTI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and stroke.","timeFrame":"The first 2 days of the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV)"},{"measure":"To assess clinical and respiratory parameters with mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight (dependent variable) through multivariate analysis.","description":"To assess the associated parameters: clinical and respiratory with mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight (dependent variable) through multivariate analysis.","timeFrame":"First 7 days of the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAcute neurological injury in patients ≥ 16 years of age with requiring mechanical ventilation for neurological causes and without baseline lung injury, defined as: normal chest x-ray and adequate oxygenation; PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 300.\n\n-\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPneumothorax, or a pleural drainage tube.
