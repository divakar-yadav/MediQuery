More than 70% of stroke patients show various degrees of neural function impairment. Motor rehabilitation in acute phase is beneficial for improving patient's structure and function of corticospinal tract. However, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute phase of stroke because of the insufficiency of professional rehabilitation therapists in stroke wards in China.The present study is to verify that nursing-directed rehabilitation can compensate for the shortage of professional rehabilitation therapists. Our previous study indicated that nursing-directed motor function rehabilitation provided more obvious effect on stroke patients with a weighted corticospinal tract lesion load (wCST-LL) smaller than 2ml. We assume that implementing rehabilitation nursing based on the wCST-LL can realize nursing-directed, wCST-LL-based precision motor rehabilitation during acute phase of ischemic stroke.The present study is to conduct randomized clinical trial to confirm the effect of nursing-directed precision rehabilitation for motor function in acute stroke patients grouped by wCST-LL, and to evaluate the effect of this precision rehabilitation by using functional scale, and to explore the histopathologic mechanism of the precision rehabilitation nursing by mean of neuroelectrophysiology and neuroimaging examination. This study might provide theoretical support for motor rehabilitation in patients during acute phase of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":212,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in experimental group were graded with modified Barthel index score, and according to the functional score of patients, the corresponding rehabilitation method was selected for functional rehabilitation from functional rehabilitation nursing program,twice a day with 30 min each time, last 1 week.","interventionNames":["Other: functional rehabilitation nursing program"]},{"label":"control group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in control group were given conventional bedside rehabilitation ,twice a day with 30 min each time, last 1 week.","interventionNames":["Other: control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"functional rehabilitation nursing program","description":"According to the modified Barthel index score, the patients' function was divided into four parts Level,each level has different kinds of rehabilitation nursing.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"control group","description":"The rehabilitation were given by the rehabilitation therapist based on the patient's condition, such as, bridge movement,limb passive motion, limb active motion,turn over,sit upw,walk, and so on.","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of motor function","description":"use Modified Barthel scale to evaluate the change of motor function,The scale were measure the function of the stroke patients,the scale have 100 scores,the function is better if the scores were higher.","timeFrame":"0 week and 1 week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of neuroelectric physiological parameters","description":"use the transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to evaluate the function of Corticospinal Tract","timeFrame":"0 week and 1 week"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of neuroimaging quantitative parameters","description":"use the Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging to evaluate the function of Corticospinal Tract","timeFrame":"0 week and 12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* the patients were diagnosed as ischemic stroke by CT or MRI and met the diagnostic criteria of World Health Organization(WHO);\n* First stroke, within 7 days, with limb dysfunction (muscle strength \\< 5 grade);\n* there was no contraindication sign of MRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) examination, and the examination was completed with good image quality and complete clinical data;\n* 18≤ages≤90;\n* consciousness\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* the blood vessels are reconnected after thrombolysis;\n* there are serious cardiopulmonary dysfunction, history of craniocerebral trauma, and other diseases affecting the affected side","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jingfen Jin, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0571-87783887","email":"zrjzkhl@zju.edu.cn"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"jingfen Jin, Master","affiliation":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Zhejiang University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hangzhou","state":"Zhejiang","zip":"310009","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Jingfen Jin, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0571-87783887","email":"zrjzkhl@zju.edu.cn"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":30.29365,"lon":120.16142}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"32978194","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wang J, Chen Y, Zhang Y, Li M, Jin J.
