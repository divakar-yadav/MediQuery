The latter is constrained by limited sensitivity and a timescale of hours to yield results, with no point-of-care test widely available. A dedicated computed tomography study of the chest is likely to be more sensitive than RT-PCR for COVID-19. Carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We aim to assess the lung apices on CTA for ground glass opacification and compare this with COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and clinical outcome measures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Covid19","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["COVID","stroke","CT","CTA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of the computed tomography angiography biomarker relative to the COVID-19 RT-PCR test","description":"Defined by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prognostic value of the computed tomography biomarker","description":"Defined by its relationship with 30 day mortality and modified rankin scale following treatment","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAll adult patients presenting with clinical features of acute ischaemic stroke undergoing investigation with computed tomography angiography at presentation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPoor image quality.
