Anaesthesiologists can use SVV as a guide for the appropriate administration of intraoperative fluids to improve postoperative prognoses. Liver surgery is a major abdominal operation, and the amount of blood lost is typically higher than that during other general abdominal surgeries. Blood loss is positively correlated with the intraoperative fluid infusion volume, and greater blood loss is associated with more postoperative complications. Additionally, comorbid liver disease or cirrhosis can increase the complexity of liver tumour resection, causing difficulty in assessing intravascular volume and determining the appropriate intraoperative infusion volume."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid Management"],"keywords":["Stroke volume variation","Fluid therapy","Hepatectomy","Alanine aminotransferase","Estimated glomerular filtration rate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This trial had a randomised study design with simple randomisation and a fixed allocation ratio (1:1 to the low-SVV group or high-SVV group).
