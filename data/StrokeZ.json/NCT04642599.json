chronic cerebellar stroke patients and healthy individuals to learn and retain a complex bimanual motor skill, trained on the neurorehabilitation robot REAplan® (bimanual version).","detailedDescription":"Over 3 consecutive days, healthy individuals and chronic cerebellar stroke patients (1) will be evaluated and (2) will train on the neurorehabilitation robot REAplan®.\n\nThey will practice several tasks on the robot REAplan® (bimanual version), requiring either movements with the affected arm (unimanual tasks) or complex, coordinated movements with both arms (bimanual tasks).\n\nIn addition, several \"classical\" clinical scales and tests will be used to evaluate overall motor-sensory-cognitive functions (clinical tests, questionnaires, ...).\n\nHand/digits motor function will be also evaluated with the kinetic device DexTrain®."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Cerebellar Stroke","Healthy Individuals
