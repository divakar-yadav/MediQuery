In cardiac, neurological and carotid surgery the incidence is known to be high (2.2-5.2%). However, little is known regarding perioperative stroke following other types of surgery including general, urological, orthopedic, thoracic and gynecological procedures. We therefore propose to undertake a multicenter, observational cohort study, to determine the current incidence of, the risk factors for, and outcome associated with perioperative stroke in patients undergoing non-cardiac and non-neurological surgery.","detailedDescription":"Patient population: Prospective cohort study of 10,000 adults undergoing non-cardiac, non-neurological surgery.\n\nScreening and enrollment: Consecutive patients undergoing (elective or emergency) non-cardiac, non-neurosurgical surgeries will be recruited.\n\nMonitoring, follow-up, and data collection: Usual treatment will be provided. Demographic details will be recorded. Patients will be visited regularly in hospital. Patient will be reviewed for neurologic deficit using the mNIHSS. Brain imaging will be performed to confirm stroke event. Follow-up at 30 days after discharge will be done to ascertain if there is any adverse outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Peri-operative Stroke","Perioperative Adverse Events","Non-cardiac Surgery","Non-neurosurgical Surgery"],"keywords":["Peri-operative stroke","incidence","risk factors","prospective"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Month","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"whole blood, serum, white cells"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital","description":"2000 cases"},{"label":"Peking University Hospital","description":"2000 cases"},{"label":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University","description":"2000 cases"},{"label":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan","description":"2000 cases"},{"label":"Tangdu Hospital, Xi'an","description":"2000 cases"},{"label":"The Prince Welsh Hospital","description":"1000 cases"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"perioperative stroke occurs during and within 30 days after surgery.","description":"The primary outcome is perioperative stroke occurs during and within 30 days after surgery.
