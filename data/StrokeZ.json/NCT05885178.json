It is the leading cause of mortality among residents in China. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) is a predictor of unfavorable outcomes and can account for up to 52% of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The definition of LVO and its optimal screening imaging modalities remain controversial. In this registry, the investigators defined LVO as an occlusion of the intracranial ICA with or without the involvement of the terminal bifurcation, M1 and/or M2 segment of the MCA, A1 and/or A2 segment of the ACA, VA, BA, or P1 and/or P2 segment of the PCA.\n\nTRACK-LVO is an academic, real-world, single-center, observational registry, in which consecutive patients hospitalized with AIS due to LVO will be treated with either EVT or BMM. Baseline information and clinical follow-up information at 90 days from stroke onset are collected. The key baseline items in this registration for both EVT and BMM groups include basic demographic profiles, past medical history, NIHSS score, treatment with intravenous alteplase, type of stroke onset, time from stroke onset to admission/imaging, imaging characteristics such as the volume of the ischemic core and occlusion site, and treatment-related complications. Additional information collected in EVT groups includes details of EVT procedure and angiographic images.\n\nThe investigators enrolled patients with LVO screened under different imaging modalities to further reveal the optimal imaging modalities in the detection of LVO. The investigators also tend to compare the prognosis of AIS patients with LVO receiving endovascular therapy and the best medical management respectively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic","Endovascular Procedures","Large Vessel Occlusion"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Therapy","Large Vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular therapy","description":"Timely thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion by either stent retriever, thrombus aspiration, others, or combination methods.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular Therapy"]},{"label":"Best medical management","description":"Patients enrolled in this group received the best medical management.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular Therapy","description":"Endovascular therapy, as an adjunct to standard stroke therapy, may be beneficial for a very select population of patients who present with an acute ischemic stroke and have a proven large, proximal occlusion on imaging.\n\nEndovascular therapy includes any one or more of the following:\n\nIntra-arterial thrombolytic therapy, aspiration, stent retrieval, or a combination of multiple mechanical devices.","armGroupLabels":["Best medical management","Endovascular therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified ranking scale (mRS) at 90 days","description":"A 0-6 scale running from perfect health without symptoms to death.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Mortality within 90 days","description":"mortality of any causes.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at 90 days","description":"The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4.
