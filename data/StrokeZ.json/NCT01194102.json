Participants will attend the YMCA for exercise sessions several times a week and receive education on how to take care of themselves after a stroke. The staff who will deliver the program will have specialized training on how to help people with stroke to exercise safely and effectively. Control group participants will be provided with YMCA memberships but will not have access to stroke specific education and group exercise classes.\n\nStaff assisting the control group will be trained in safety and contraindications after stroke, but will not receive the additional specialized training in exercise/education programs for persons with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Exercise","Physical function","Community program","Patient education","Self-management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Community Wellness Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants with stroke will attend a 12 week Community Wellness Program.
