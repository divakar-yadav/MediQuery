Brain magnetic resonance mechanism research will also be included to reveal the possible mechanism of multi-channel tDCS technology for PSCI brain network.\n\nThus, the efficacy and mechanism of multi-channel tDCS in post-stroke cognitive function rehabilitation will be researched both in the clinical and basic levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"multi-channel tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the multi-channel tDCS stimulation group, a 1:4 (anode: cathode) approach was applied, with the central anode placed in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (reference 10-20 standard lead EEG), and the remaining cathode distributed around the central electrode.\n\nThe rising time and falling time of current are 30 seconds respectively.
