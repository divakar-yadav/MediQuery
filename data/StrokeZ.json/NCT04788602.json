It was estimated that between 15% and 30% of ischemic strokes were due to a cardioembolic source, Therefore, TTE has been assumed as an important screening tool in patients with ischemic stroke, as atrial fibrillation is one of the leading risk factors. However, current guidelines have little evidence in whether performing TTE can alter clinical management and prevent a future stroke. We aim to present the association of performing TTE and clinical outcomes in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["the Impact of Echocardiography on the Recurrence of Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"recurrent stroke","description":"the correlation between the echocardiography and recurrence of stroke","timeFrame":"one year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with acute stroke and receiving echocardiography\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with acute stroke and not receiving echocardiography","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients with acute stroke and receiving echocardiography","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Wan-Ching Lien","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886-23123456","phoneExt":"65637","email":"wanchinglien@ntu.edu.tw"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Emergency Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000012008","term":"Recurrence"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M14540","name":"Recurrence","asFound":"Recurrence","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
