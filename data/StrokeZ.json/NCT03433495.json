The score was obtained from the average score in three areas: repetition of words and repetition of phrases; listening comprehension exceeding the 15th percentile of Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination; and from the average score obtained in three areas: word comprehension, commands and complex ideational material.\n* The patient was motivated, emotionally stable and had good attention.\n* Signed informed consent was provided.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with a history of a previous stroke other than the index event or with any clinical condition (e.g., short life expectancy, coexisting disease) or other characteristics that precluded appropriate follow-up in the study\n* patients participating in any therapeutic intervention clinical trials evaluating poststroke recovery\n* use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with patient evaluation.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001037","term":"Aphasia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000013064","term":"Speech Disorders"},{"id":"D000007806","term":"Language Disorders"},{"id":"D000003147","term":"Communication Disorders"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4042","name":"Aphasia","asFound":"Aphasia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15554","name":"Speech Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10513","name":"Language Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6064","name":"Communication Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
