Ischemic cardio-embolic stroke accounts for around 25% of ischemic strokes, and ischemic cardio-embolic stroke in a context of cardiac arrhythmia due to atrial fibrillation (CAAF) is the leading non-atheromatous cause. The aim of this study is to optimise the secondary prevention of CAAF-related stroke identified at the University Hospital of Dijon Burgundy in the framework of the recommendations of the '2010-2014 stroke plan' and the Compulsory Consultation at the 6th month (Directive DGOS//2015/262 of the 3rd August 2015)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":441,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke related to CAAF","interventionNames":["Drug: Anticoagulants"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anticoagulants","armGroupLabels":["Stroke related to CAAF"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"rate of stroke recurrences","timeFrame":"12 months after inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients managed for stroke at the stroke unit of Dijon University Hospital for CAAF-related cardio-embolic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* NA","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patient with stroke resulting from occlusion of a cerebral artery (cerebral infarction) with a clot detached from the heart that exhibits an arrhythmia by Auricular Fibrillation or the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Dijon Bourgogne","city":"Dijon","zip":"21079","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2403","name":"Embolic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000000925","term":"Anticoagulants"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M17245","name":"Vitamin K","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17248","name":"Vitamins","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3934","name":"Anticoagulants","asFound":"Domains","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M160756","name":"Antivitamins K","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T481","name":"Vitamin K","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T450","name":"Menaquinone","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T449","name":"Menadione","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T452","name":"Naphthoquinone","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T458","name":"Phylloquinone","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Micro","name":"Micronutrients"},{"abbrev":"Coag","name":"Coagulants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"AnCoag","name":"Anticoagulants"},{"abbrev":"Vi","name":"Vitamins"}]}},"hasResults":false}
