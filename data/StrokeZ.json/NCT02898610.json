Patients will be randomised to 0.5 mg/day of Colchicine plus usual care, or to usual care alone.\n\nTo investigate the efficacy of low dose colchicine (0.5mg/day) plus usual care (defined as antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive treatment, and appropriate lifestyle advice) compared with usual care alone to prevent non-fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, hospitalization for unstable angina and vascular death after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) not caused by cardiac embolism or other defined causes unrelated to atherosclerosis","detailedDescription":"Inflammation is a key pathophysiological contributor to unstable atherosclerotic plaque and thrombo-embolic events, stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death. Internationally, clinical trials are targeting atherosclerotic inflammation in patients with coronary disease using methotrexate, colchicine, and canukinumab.\n\nAims:\n\nThe primary aim is to compare low-dose colchicine (0.5mg/day) plus usual care, to usual care alone, to prevent non-fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke and coronary events and vascular death after non-severe, noncardioembolic TIA/stroke. Secondary objectives will investigate safety of low-dose colchicine, and efficacy for each component of the primary outcome, fatal and non-fatal events, disabling and non-disabling stroke, effect modification by prespecified subgroups, and impact on direct health care costs, adjusted for quality-adjusted life years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Attack, Transient","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3154,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Colchicine treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Colchicine 0.5mg/day plus usual care for 60 months","interventionNames":["Drug: Colchicine"]},{"label":"Usual Standard of care alone","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Normal standard of care remains for these patients"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Colchicine","armGroupLabels":["Colchicine treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence of non-fatal ischemic stroke","description":"Any recurrence of non-fatal ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"any time within 60 month"},{"measure":"on-fatal Major Cardiac event","description":"Non-fatal hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest","timeFrame":"any time within 60 months"},{"measure":"Vascular death","description":"Fatal ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest","timeFrame":"60 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
