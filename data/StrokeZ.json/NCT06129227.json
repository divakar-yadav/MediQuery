Mobility dysfunctions are among the most common impairments observed after stroke. Restoration of mobility is also a top priority in rehabilitation goal-setting by stroke patients. In daily life, functional ambulation in the community requires the ability to maintain walking balance while simultaneously engaging in other attention-demanding tasks (i.e., dual-tasking), such as walking when holding a conversation, or crossing the street while attending to traffic signals. There is increasing evidence that performing a cognitive task in conjunction with a mobility task would cause more severe degradation of one or both tasks among stroke patients when compared with age-matched able-bodied individuals. This phenomenon, termed \"cognitive-motor interference\", should warrant detailed study, since it has an important impact on community-living among people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Dual-task training","Cognitive-motor interference"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"After stratification according to gender and walking speed, the participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) dual-task training, (2) single-task training, and (3) control intervention, using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"This will be a single-blinded RCT.
