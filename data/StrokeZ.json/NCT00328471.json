The APN-CM will work as part of an interdisciplinary post-stroke consultation team (PSC-Team) that will review problems identified at an in-home patient assessment. The core PSC-Team will include a geriatrician, a community-based general internist, a Clinical Nurse Specialist from the acute stroke unit, the APN-CM, and a physical therapist. Extended team members will be available as-needed and will include a neurologist, pharmacist, physiatrist, social worker, speech therapist, occupational therapist, and dietitian. The PSC-Team will develop patient care plans specific to each problem identified by the APN-CM. A copy of the care plans, evidence-based guidelines, pertinent references, and a short paragraph providing \"academic detailing\" specific to the patient's problems will be given to the patient's PCP by phone and in writing. The APN-CM will work collaboratively with the PCP to implement the recommendations and provide ongoing monitoring.The primary outcome of overall well-being of stroke survivors will be obtained at 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["patient care management","cerebrovascular accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":380,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"care management"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nDiagnosis of ischemic stroke.
