It will enroll a convenience sample of children with SCA, obtain cross-sectional baseline data at enrolment, and follow them as a prospective cohort for a period of 24 months. The cohort will be divided into two arms based on the initial screening TCD result: 1) those who have a normal (less than 170 cm/sec time averaged mean velocity (TAMV)) initial screening TCD and will be an observation/control cohort; and 2) those who have an elevated initial screening TCD (either conditional (170-199 cm/sec) or abnormal (greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec) TAMV) and will be a treatment cohort that receives open-label hydroxyurea therapy as per the dosing and administration schedule. Those who are found to have a normal TCD at enrolment and are part of the observation/control cohort will undergo repeat TCD 12 months after enrolment. If the TCD at 12 months has changed to an elevated velocity (conditional or abnormal), the study participant can begin study treatment, but will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis. The primary hypothesis is after 12 months of hydroxyurea therapy, children with conditional TCD velocities will achieve a mean decrease of \\>15cm/sec from their baseline TCD TAMV."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell Anemia in Children"],"keywords":["Sickle Celll Anemia","Transcranial Doppler","Tanzania","Hydroxyurea","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The cohort will be divided into two arms based on the initial screening TCD result: 1) those who have a normal initial screening TCD and will be an observation/control cohort; and 2) those who have an elevated initial screening TCD (either conditional or abnormal TAMV) and will be a treatment cohort that receives open-label hydroxyurea therapy as per the dosing and administration schedule","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":202,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Elevated Initial Screening TCD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Those who have an elevated initial screening TCD (either conditional or abnormal TAMV) and will be a treatment cohort that receives open-label hydroxyurea therapy as per the dosing and administration schedule.","interventionNames":["Drug: Hydroxyurea","Diagnostic Test: Elevated Arm TCD Examination"]},{"label":"Normal Initial Screening TCD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Those who are found to have a normal TCD at enrolment are a part of the observation/control cohort and will undergo repeat TCD every 12 months after enrolment.
