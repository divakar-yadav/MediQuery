Particularly the effectiveness of early rehabilitation combining with vibration training for patients with acute stroke is unknown.\n\nTherefore, this study aims to exam the effectiveness of vibration training on muscle strength of lower limbs, functional recovery, and mood state among patients with acute stroke.\n\nA randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Patients with acute ischemic stroke will be selected and randomly assigned to either control group (CG), exercise group (EG), wearable leg vibration training group (WG), or lower extremity vibration training group (LG). All groups will receive conventional treatment and regular rehabilitation. Neurologic disability (Modified Rankin Scale), muscle strength, functional status (Postural Assessment Scale and Barthel Scale), and mood state (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) will be collected to compare between groups and pre- and post-differences."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vibration; Exposure","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The outcome data will be collected by a research assistant who was blinded in group assignment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Only received conventional therapy comprised of standardized treatment and regular rehabilitation (i.e., postural training, facilitation techniques, stretching exercise, and strengthening exercise) prescribed by a rehabilitation physician and performed at 3 to 6 days after admission for five 60-minute sessions per week by the physical, occupational, and speech therapists in the rehabilitation center of the medical center."},{"label":"exercise group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The exercise group will receive extra 5 days of 30-minute lower-limb ergometer exercise training in addition to the conventional therapy.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ergometer exercise"]},{"label":"wearable leg vibration training group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The wearable leg vibration training group will receive extra 5 days of 30-minute wearable leg vibration of lower limbs combined with 30-minute lower-limb ergometer exercise training at post-vibration session, in addition to the conventional therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Vibration training","Behavioral: ergometer exercise"]},{"label":"lower-extremity weight bearing vibration training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The lower-extremity weight bearing vibration training group will receive extra 5 days of 30-minute lower-extremity weight bearing vibration combined with30-minute lower-limb ergometer exercise training at post-vibration session, in addition to the conventional therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Vibration training","Behavioral: ergometer exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Vibration training","description":"The vibration sessions were performed and supervised by a stroke care experienced registered nurses/researchers who had both nurse and physiotherapist license.
