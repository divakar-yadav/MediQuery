The severity of the neurological condition was assessed using the NIHSS scale on days 1, 3 and 7 of stroke. The incidence of periodontal diseases was classified using the Hall's scale in the 1st day of stroke. On days 1 and 7 of stroke, the concentration of IL-1beta, MMP8, OPG and RANKL in the patients' saliva was assessed using the Elisa technique. At the same time, the level of CRP and the number of leukocytes in the peripheral blood were tested on days 1, 3 and 7 of the stroke, and the incidence of upper respiratory and urinary tract infections was assessed.","detailedDescription":"The course of an ischemic stroke varies by many factors.
