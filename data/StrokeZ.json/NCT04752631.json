This exploratory study was to describe the feasibility and outcome of thrombolytic therapy with TNK-tPA in 4.5-24 hours after stroke guided by a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR in the region of ischemia.","detailedDescription":"In patients with acute stroke with an unknown time of onset, intravenous alteplase guided by a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR in the region of ischemia resulted in a significantly better functional outcome at 90 days. This trial will enroll acute ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 to 24 hours of onset. All the patients had an ischemic lesion that was visible on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging but no parenchymal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), which indicated that the stroke had a ischemic penumbra. Randomization will be 1:1 to TNK-tPA (experimental) or standard treatment (control), in compliance with guidelines for acute stroke. Clinical outcome was assessed by disability on the basis of the modified Rankin scale at 90 days follow-up, which will be performed by a blinded assessor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["TNK-tPA","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The Outcomes will be performed by a blinded assessor.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TNK-tPA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TNK-tPA (0.25mg/kg) given as a single bolus over 5-10 seconds immediately upon randomization.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Routine Therapy","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients will be treated with standard of care in compliance with guidelines for acute stroke"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"The participants received TNK-tPA thrombolytic therapy","armGroupLabels":["TNK-tPA"],"otherNames":["TNK-tPA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1","description":"the minimum and maximum values of mRS are 0 and 6, respectively; higher mRS mean a worse outcome","timeFrame":"90 Days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2","description":"the minimum and maximum values of mRS are 0 and 6, respectively; higher mRS mean a worse outcome","timeFrame":"90 Days"},{"measure":"Distribution of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"the minimum and maximum values of mRS are 0 and 6, respectively; higher mRS mean a worse outcome","timeFrame":"90 Days"},{"measure":"Changes in National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS)","description":"the minimum and maximum values of NIHSS are 42 and 0, respectively; higher NIHSS mean a worse outcome","timeFrame":"24 hours and 1 week"},{"measure":"vascular events","description":"The incidence of stroke and other vascular events","timeFrame":"90 Days"},{"measure":"proportion of death","description":"death due to any cause","timeFrame":"14 days"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"sICH was defined as 4 or more increase in NIHSS caused by hemorrhage","timeFrame":"48 hours"},{"measure":"Proportion of intraparenchymal hemorrhage (PH1 and PH2)","description":"Proportion of PH1 and PH2 within 48 hours after the treatment","timeFrame":"48 hours"},{"measure":"proportion of hemorrhagic transformation","description":"Intracranial hemorrhage assessed by MRI/CT","timeFrame":"7 Days"},{"measure":"any bleeding events","description":"proportion of any bleeding events","timeFrame":"7 Days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
