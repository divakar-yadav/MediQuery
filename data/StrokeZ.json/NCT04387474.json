This study adopts centralized uniform random 1:1 grouping, subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group. Randomization schemes are generated by statistical professionals using SAS software.","detailedDescription":"Brain computer interface(BCI) is a noninvasive nervous system intervention. As a new method, it is applied in rehabilitation by stimulating peripheral nerve, such as motor, vibration, sensory, in combination with other stimulations, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, etc.\n\nIn traditional rehabilitation therapy, hand-holding training is completed by physical therapist. Rehabilitation robot is also used for auxiliary training. BCI therapy will stimulate patients to take part in rehabilitation training more actively and obtain better effects on the rehabilitation of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia Following Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Brain-computer interface","Electric stimulation therapy","Stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"brain-computer interface rehabilitation training and traditional rehabilitation training.","interventionNames":["Device: Brain-computer interface","Other: Traditional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"traditional rehabilitation training.","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Brain-computer interface","description":"brain-computer interface rehabilitation training.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Traditional rehabilitation","description":"traditional rehabilitation training.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The improvement of upper limb motor function at 1 month after randomization.","description":"Tested by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale.","timeFrame":"1 month after randomization compared with traditional rehabilitation strategy."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The improvement of upper limb motor function at 3 month after randomization.","description":"Tested by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale.","timeFrame":"3 months after randomization compared with traditional rehabilitation strategy ."},{"measure":"The improvement of upper limb motor function at 1, 3 month after randomization.","description":"Tested by Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT).","timeFrame":"1, 3 months after randomization compared with traditional rehabilitation strategy."},{"measure":"The improvement in muscle tone at 1, 3 month after randomization.","description":"Tested by the Modified Ashworth scale (MAS).","timeFrame":"1, 3 months after randomization compared with traditional rehabilitation strategy."},{"measure":"The improvement of patients' ability to take care of themselves in daily life","description":"Tested by Instrumental Activity of Daily living (IDAL).","timeFrame":"1, 3 months after randomization compared with traditional rehabilitation strategy."}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"The changes of brain network properties.","description":"Evaluated by fMRI before and after rehabilitaion.","timeFrame":"1 month and 3 months after randomization."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
