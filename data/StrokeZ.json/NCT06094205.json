The implanted medical device measures the person's brain activity as they try to talk and outputs their intended speech. By bypassing the injured parts of the nervous system this way, we can observe how individual brain cells are involved in speaking and working together as a network, to produce speech, and we can learn to decipher this activity to output what the person is trying to say."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anarthria","Dysarthria","Tetraplegia","Spinal Cord Injuries","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Brain Stem Infarctions","Locked-in Syndrome","Muscular Dystrophies"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BrainGate Neural Interface System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Placement of the BrainGate2 sensor(s) into the speech-related cortex","interventionNames":["Device: BrainGate Neural Interface System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"BrainGate Neural Interface System","description":"Placement of the BrainGate2 sensor(s) into the speech-related cortex","armGroupLabels":["BrainGate Neural Interface System"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sensor implant duration for at least one-year without any device-related Serious Adverse Events or explant","description":"To determine the safety of the Sensor and overall safety of the System.
