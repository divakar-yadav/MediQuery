There is a high probability that patients reduce or discontinue medications by self-determination, leading to a high risk of stroke recurrence in these patients. Comprehensive and long-term patient educations ameliorating their self-management are important making patients possible to be managed according to the guidelines for their risk factors. Using disease management programs created for each of risk factors according to clinical practice guidelines, the influence of those programs were evaluated for the prevention of stroke recurrence in this Disease Management Program Stroke Trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, disease management programs,
