The investigators hypothesize that the improvements in daily functioning are partially due to compensation strategies and partially due to motor learning.","detailedDescription":"Background: Most stroke patients continue to suffer from upper extremity motor deficiencies even after prolonged and intense rehabilitation in hospital. Even though guidelines and other studies recommend to apply a rehabilitation programs as patient reception. As opposed to that there is a scarce evidence for the efficacy of the rehabilitation.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate by objective measures the improvement in motor performance of the upper extremity of stroke patients in the sub acute period. Secondary objective is to describe the correlation between proximal and distal motor deficiencies of the upper extremity.\n\nHypothesis: Patients will show better hand performance at the end of hospitalization. Part of it can be attributed to the rehabilitation and part to a spontaneous recovery. Correlation will be found for proximal and distal upper extremity motor deficiencies.\n\nMethods:\n\nTrial began only after the IRB research approval. All treatment sessions will implemented by the physical and occupational staff of the hospital. Assessments for the measures will be carry out by a certified physical therapist which is coinvestigator. The coinvestigator collect the raw data for analysis in Excel and than in SPSS.\n\n20 stroke patients who meet the inclusion criteria will participate in the study, after signing an informed consent.Patients will undergo the first assessment of all measures, e.g: motor abilities by Fugl-Meyer test, handwriting kinematic and kinetic measures and surface electromyography for measurement of muscle synergy.Patients will be treated by standard rehabilitation of physical and occupational therapy for a period of 3-4 weeks. Before discharge from hospital patients will undergo another assessment of all measures, in order to evaluate the progression in their upper limb motor abilities from reception. Part of the patients will be assessed again two to three weeks after discharge as follow up.\n\nOutcome Measures: upper limb Fugl-Meyer assessment, handwriting Air-time, pressure and velocity, EMG (i.e., muscle onset, muscle amplitude, muscle co-activation ratio).\n\nStatistical analysis: ANOVA analysis will be used to measure time effect. Correlation between measures will be measured by Pearson's correlation. Sample size (n=20) was calculated based on 5 points improvement in Fugl-Meyer test as minimal significant change with power of 0.8 and p-level under 0.05 for significance.\n\nKey words: Stroke, Muscle synergy, Handwriting, Fugl-Meyer"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Weeks","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"Stroke patients at the subacute phase","interventionNames":["Other: stroke"]},{"label":"Healthy controls","description":"healthy age-matched voluntiers","interventionNames":["Other: Healthy controls"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"stroke","description":"task-oriented therapy: physical and occupational therapy emphasizing integration of the patients needs, environment and context","armGroupLabels":["Stroke"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Healthy controls","description":"no treatment","armGroupLabels":["Healthy controls"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment.","description":"zero to 66 points scale, measuring the impairment level of the upper extremity.
