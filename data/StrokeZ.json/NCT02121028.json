The hypothesis is that non-invasive imaging biomarkers that stratify stroke risk and distinguish mechanisms of IAD. This prospective multicenter study will enroll 175 patients with recently symptomatic high-grade IAD. Patients will be studied within 21 days of the index event (allowing appropriate time to arrange for diverse imaging modalities), with the following advanced neuroimaging techniques to elucidate mechanisms of recurrent ischemia:\n\n* Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRA) to assess volumetric flow rate through the stenotic artery.\n* Magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging (PWI-MRI) to determine distal tissue perfusion.\n* Vasomotor reactivity by Transcranial Doppler using the breath-holding technique (BHI-TCD) to assess compensatory flow characteristics to the territory distal to the affected artery;\n* Transcranial Doppler with embolic signal monitoring to evaluate artery-to-artery embolism that reflects plaque instability.\n\nPatients will receive standardized medical management and its effectiveness on blood pressure, lipid, and glycemic control will be monitored.\n\nThe primary outcome is recurrent stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery during a 1-year follow-up period; secondary outcomes are: a) new asymptomatic ischemic lesions on MRI in the distribution of the stenotic artery at 6-8 weeks, and b) transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the distribution of the stenotic artery during a 1-year follow-up period.\n\nPatients will be recruited at various sites that will be trained and certified on the imaging techniques employed. Raw imaging data will be interpreted centrally."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Vascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease, Stroke/TIA","description":"Stroke/TIA due to high grade IAD ≤21 days from symptom onset."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery","description":"Time to ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery.
