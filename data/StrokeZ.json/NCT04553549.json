This includes evaluating the conversion rates to a transfemoral approach. A secondary aim of the study is to assess the radial artery occlusion rates post procedure.","detailedDescription":"Patients who are undergoing endovascular intervention will be enrolled into the study. Consent will be obtained for the procedure and for the use of their prospectively collected clinical data. As the metrics analyzed in this study are already normally collected, this study can be considered as a secondary use of the data. The procedure will be done using standard criteria as per operator preference. All interventional cases at the study institution undergo a \"radial first\" approach, meaning that the access site of choice is the radial artery. The investigators will measure the radial artery size to ensure that the artery is greater than 2.4 mm in order to use the Infinity catheter (8Fr). If the artery does not meet the size criteria, only a 6Fr sheath will be used, and the data recorded during the procedure will not be utilized for analysis in this study. The preoperative and postoperative care will be the same for all the patients. No tests will be done outside of standard of care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Tumor","Stroke, Acute","Brain Aneurysm","Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations","Carotid Stenosis","Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis"],"keywords":["neuro-embolization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transradial approach","description":"The procedure will be done using standard criteria as per operator preference.
