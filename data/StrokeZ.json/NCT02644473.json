Intravenous TXA has also been shown to reduce blood loss, reduce transfusion requirements, and decrease length of stay for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty. These benefits occur without increasing risks of thromboembolism events such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, myocardial infarctions, and cerebrovascular events in patients without history of, or risk factors for thromboembolic disease. Topical TXA in TJA has also been demonstrated to show the above benefits without any increase risks, as well as systemic absorption of the medication that is below the effective therapeutic plasma concentration.\n\nPreliminary retrospective studies has demonstrated that IV TXA to be safe and effective in patients with risk factors for thromboembolic events and patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists score III or IV.\n\nCurrently, there are no prospective studies on the use of either IV or topical TXA in these higher risk patients. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in symptomatic thromboembolism events in the subset of patients with a history of, or risk factors for thromboembolic disease for topically applied TXA in total joint arthroplasty (TJA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pulmonary Embolism","Deep Vein Thrombosis","Stroke","Myocardial Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tranexamic acid","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Investigators will administer topical (1.5g) TXA during total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty","interventionNames":["Drug: Tranexamic Acid"]},{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Normal saline"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tranexamic Acid","armGroupLabels":["Tranexamic acid"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Normal saline","description":"Control","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Deep Vein Thrombosis","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Pulmonary Embolism","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Stroke","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPresence of one or more of seven risk factors for thromboembolic events - Prior DVT, PE, MI, CVA, coronary artery stent placement, CABG, or prothrombotic condition (Factor V Leiden deficiency, protein C deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, etc).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSimultaneous bilateral, hip resurfacing, partial knee, and revision arthroplasties","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"10673876","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Jansen AJ, Andreica S, Claeys M, D'Haese J, Camu F, Jochmans K.
