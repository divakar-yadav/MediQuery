Detailed medical histories will be obtained from all included patients and/or caregivers, and comprehensive musculoskeletal examinations will be conducted. Patient information, including name, surname, age, gender, occupation, education level, marital status, body mass index, duration of illness, stroke type, affected side, dominant side, and comorbidities, will be recorded.\n\nAll included patients in the study will be assessed by the same physician using the Functional Ambulation Scale, Community Integration Questionnaire , Mini-BESTest (Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test), balance assessment on the Hur Smart balance device, The Timed Up and Go Test , Tinetti Balance and Gait Test, Vas Kinesiophobia Scale., and Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Kinesiophobia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Kinesiophobia","Stroke","balance","pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patient","description":"The specified tests will be administered to 50 patients who have experienced strokes and meet the criteria.","interventionNames":["Other: Balance measurements using the HUR Smart balance device, balance tests, and other surveys."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Balance measurements using the HUR Smart balance device, balance tests, and other surveys.","description":"50 stroke patients will undergo balance measurements using the HUR Smart balance device and other tests.","armGroupLabels":["stroke patient"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia","description":"Scale, \"The Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale (TKS) is a self-reported, 17-item scale developed to measure the fear of movement.
