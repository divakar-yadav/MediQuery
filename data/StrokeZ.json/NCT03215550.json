In patients with recent stroke, the 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography-computed tomography highlights high-risk culprit carotid plaque and is more discriminatory than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Using hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging investigators propose to build upon these findings by prospectively assessing 18F-fluoride uptake in a broad range of patients with acute transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke. Investigators will specifically examine the association of 18F-fluoride uptake with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging assessments of atherosclerotic plaque, especially the role of thrombus and lipid. Finally, using transcranial Doppler and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging, an assessment of the functional consequences of 18F-fluoride-positive atherosclerotic plaque will be performed. If successful, this technique has a number of valuable translational applications including the better selection of patients for carotid intervention.","detailedDescription":"The ability to identify the culprit carotid plaque represents a key goal in carotid artery imaging. Although an array of non-invasive imaging techniques can detect a wide spectrum of complementary high-risk characteristics, no single modality can reliably identify vulnerable plaques associated with future stroke development. Substantial histological data suggests that specific plaque components identify patients at high-risk for future ipsilateral stroke and cardiovascular events. This implies that investigators need to look beyond the traditional paradigm where the basis for carotid endarterectomy were formulated by an invasive imaging modality that provided no information on the arterial wall composition. Alternative imaging strategies are therefore required targeting not only in vivo carotid morphology but also plaque biology and disease activity. This is fundamental to optimal risk-stratification and appropriate selection of patients for high-risk vascular intervention. One new approach is to use non-invasive molecular imaging targeted at plaque biology using hybrid systems such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Carotid Stenosis"],"keywords":["atherosclerosis, imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"At the time of carotid endarterectomy, which is an established surgical intervention aimed at reducing the future risk of stroke in symptomatic patients, tissue will be collected, and lesion integrity and geometry will be preserved as much as possible. Specimens will be photographed in detail to permit subsequent assessment by independent and blinded reviewers. The excised tissue will be aligned and labelled to permit orientation in the carotid artery axis before undertaking 7.4 T magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, carotid plaque will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
