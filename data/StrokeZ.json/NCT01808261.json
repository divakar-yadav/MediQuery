GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity to MAG and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition and has been shown to improve functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models, possibly by promoting neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study (MAG104615) is designed to establish Proof of Concept (PoC) for GSK249320 in ischemic stroke patients. MAG104615 will be a placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, repeat dose, Bayesian design study. PoC will be achieved by demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in lower limb motor recovery, specifically by evaluating changes in gait velocity from baseline to Day 90/Month 3. Subjects will also be followed out to Day 180/Month 6 to further evaluate longer term motor recovery and safety. Additional secondary efficacy measures of motor recovery will be evaluated to further demonstrate and characterize the extent and duration of overall motor recovery after treatment with GSK249320. Changes in disability and neurological impairment will be characterized after treatment with GSK249320 and explored for how they relate to motor recovery. This PoC study will also further characterize the safety, PK, and immunogenicity of GSK249320 will explore pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and will explore use of actigraphy to measure motor recovery. Subjects will be stratified by gait velocity at baseline for randomization (1:1 allocation) into one of two treatment groups: 15mg/kg GSK249320, or placebo. Each subject will receive 2 repeat IV doses of GSK249320 or placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":134,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo is a clear, colorless solution (50mM acetate buffer, pH 5.5 containing 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate-80 and made isotonic with 111.2 mM sodium chloride).
