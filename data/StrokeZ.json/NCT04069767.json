Effects on and level of physical activity, and 2) user's identifications of positive and negative features in content and coordination of physiotherapy integrated in post stroke rehabilitation. Function parameters of balance, gait and levels of physical activity at baseline and at 12 weeks will be compared to those obtained from the standard care group. Semistructured interviews will be conducted to identify patients' perceptions of key positive and negative features of content and coordination of I-CoreDIST and standard care rehabilitation after a stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Physiotherapy","Rehabilitation","Trunk Stability","Stroke","Sub-acute","Innovative","Randomized controlled trial","Qualitative study","Gait","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a parallel trial.

Enhanced somatosensory integration of hands, feet and face, including reduced influence of vision to enhance somatosensory integration.\n3. Proximal stability prior to selective task-oriented movement of limbs, head, eyes.\n4. Inclusion of dual tasks (motor/motor and motor/cognitive) in exercises and activities such as walking indoors, out-doors and climbing stairs.\n5.

The EQ-5D-3L comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension.\n\nThe EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale","description":"Survey to assess self-perceived quality of life.
