The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. To explore the therapeutic effect of TBS to patients with PSCI.\n2. To compare effect of TBS with different dose.\n3. To explore the mechanism of TBS by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nParticipants will be asked to do:\n\n1. Treated with TBS and cognitive training for 3 weeks (15 days).\n2. Assessed with several scales, including Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-revised in China (WAIS-RC), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) before and after treatment.\n3. Perform the resting fMRI, electroencephalogram (EEG) and event related potential before and after treatment.\n\nResearchers will compare high-dose group, low-dose group and sham group to see if TBS play a role in PSCI and if the effect of high dose TBS was stronger than low dose.","detailedDescription":"the procedure of study\n\n1. Patients were recruited and agreed with Informed Consent.\n2. All patients were assessed with MMSE, MoCA, LOTCA, WAIS and WMS, meanwhile they conduct fMRI and EEG. Target of TBS set at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).\n3. TBS was performed for 15 days (5 days \\* 3 weeks).\n4. Within 3 days after TBS, all patients were assessed with MMSE, MoCA, LOTCA, WAIS and WMS, meanwhile they conduct fMRI and EEG.\n5.
