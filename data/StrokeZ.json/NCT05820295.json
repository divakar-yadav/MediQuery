The hypothesis is that assigning care coordinators to older adults based on perceived need will be more effective at preventing emergency department visits and hospitalizations compared to usual care.","detailedDescription":"This project will use a pragmatic clinical trial embedded in an accountable care organization (ACO) to determine the comparative effectiveness of two different approaches for selecting older adults at risk for cardiovascular outcomes to receive support from care coordinators: (1) an approach that assigns older adults to care coordinators based on self-reported difficulty with care coordination, or (2) usual care, which generally assigns older adults to care coordinators after hospital discharge, regardless of perceived need. The investigators will include community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries â‰¥65 years old with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or 1 or more CVD risk factors who have been attributed to the NewYork Quality Care ACO and who have fragmented care. The investigators will randomize the participants into two groups. This study is highly pragmatic, and the intervention is sustainable and scalable. Moreover, the proposed approach has the potential to improve care delivery and outcomes for older adults at risk for cardiovascular outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Myocardial Infarction","Atrial Fibrillation","Diabetes Mellitus","Heart Failure","Hyperlipidemias","Hypertension","Ischemic Heart Disease","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["care coordination","accountable care organization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will assign care coordinators to individuals based on perceived need for assistance with care coordination.
