Participants (normal individuals without migraine and migraineurs) are included after standardized diagnostic procedures (TCD and c-TCD). For migraineurs with large RLS further examinations (c-TTE and brain MRI) are required. Up to 10 study sites nationwide will be needed to recruit the planned participant population during a 1-year period.\n\nThe information of each participants will be registered, including basic facts, the longitudinal headache history, frequency, location, quality, intensity, duration, accompanied symptoms, precipitating and exacerbating factors, with or without aura, MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaire."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Right-to-left Shunt","Migraine","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["right-to-left shunt","contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler","migraine","silent cerebral infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group 1","description":"Normal individuals without migraine"},{"label":"group 2","description":"Migraineurs"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"brain MRI","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* For group 1: Normal healthy individual without migraine.\n* For group 2: Clinical history of migraine diagnosed by a neurologist according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects with stenotic intracranial or extracranial arteries or intracranial abnormalities diagnosed with TCD.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We detect RLS through contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (c-TCD).
