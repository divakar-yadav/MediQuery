If suitable parameters can be identified, a follow up trial to identify patients at risk for AF will be conducted before a stroke happens.\n\nParameters tested are\n\n1. Electrophysiological differences between patients with paroxysmal AF and no history of AF\n2. \"Vascular Stiffness\" detected by an iPhone app\n\nAll patients will undergo a cardiogoniometrie and a pulse wave analysis with an iPhone. Each exam takes 5 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","atrial electrophysiology","stroke","vascular stiffness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":287,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Paroxysmal Af","description":"No Intervention is planned.
