Patients able to walk alone are also assessed with 3D gait analysis. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of gait training in Lokomat on biomecanic gait parameters in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait","Stroke","Robotic Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"peak knee flexion (degrees)","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"hip and ankle kinematics (degrees)","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 week"},{"measure":"kinetics (newton/meter)","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 week"},{"measure":"spatio temporal parameter (m/s)","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* single stroke\n* able to walk alone\n* \\> 18years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cognitive impairments disturbing understanding\n* Uncontrolled medical disorder associated","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"stroke patients follow in our rehabilitation hospital, able to walk alone","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Hopital Raymond Poincare","city":"Garches","zip":"92380","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.84226,"lon":2.18232}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
