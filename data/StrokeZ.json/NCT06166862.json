Visuomotor training strategies such as AO and MI therapy rely on the activity of the mirror neuron system to facilitate motor re-learning. Mirror neurons are activated during the performance of goal-directed actions, also when observing the same action and visualizing the action in the mind.\n\nThis clinical trial aims to test whether the application of AO and MI treatment in stroke in addition to conventional rehabilitation programs has an additional effect on motor recovery, activities of daily living, and quality of life.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the most common neurological disorders that causes chronic disability in adulthood. Stroke-related neurological dysfunction causes impairment in motor and sensory skills and limitation in the ability to perform daily living activities, resulting in decreased independence of patients. This process causes significant impairment in the quality of life of stroke patients.\n\nIn recent years, motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO) therapy strategies have been used in rehabilitation programs to increase motor learning in stroke. Visuomotor training strategies such as AO and MI therapy rely on the activity of the mirror neuron system to facilitate motor re-learning. Mirror neurons are activated during the performance of goal-directed actions, also when observing the same action and visualizing the action in the mind.\n\nThis clinical trial aims to test whether the application of AO and MI treatment in stroke in addition to conventional rehabilitation programs has an additional effect on motor recovery, activities of daily living, and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective randomized controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation in stroke patients in addition to conventional rehabilitation programs.","interventionNames":["Other: Action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Sham action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham comparator for action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation in stroke patients in addition to conventional rehabilitation programs.","interventionNames":["Other: Sham action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Action observation and motor imagery therapy for rehabilitation","description":"Action observation; Patients will watch some exercises accompanied by music from a previously prepared video for 10 minutes.

It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. The motor domain is used in this study, which includes items assessing movement, coordination, and reflex action of the upper and lower extremities. Motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 100 points (normal motor performance).
