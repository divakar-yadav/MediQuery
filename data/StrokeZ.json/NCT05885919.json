Patients who were eligible to the inclusion criteria and ineligible to the exclusion criteria will be stratified by time to trial drug: early (\\<3 hours) and late (3-6 hours). Then each layer will be randomly assigned into two groups by a 1:1 ratio after the ICF was received. Patients in one arm will be given 15ml edaravone and dexborneol concentrated solution for injection (37.5mg, containing edaravone 30mg and dexborneol 7.5mg) twice a day for 10-14 days, and those in the other arm will be given an equivalent placebo drug. All patients will be followed up for 90 days. The primary outcome is the proportion of modified Rankin Scale 0-2 and the safety outcome is the proportion of severe adverse events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute","Treatment Outcome"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Semi-dark band","Brain cell protection","Time window","Erafurone dextrol injection","Treatment Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Subjects with AIS who met the criteria for inclusion were stratified 1:1 from onset to use of the investigational drug: early (\\< 3 hours) and late (3-6 hours).\n\nEach layer was then randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio: the right group and the placebo group.\n\nTest group:\n\nEdaravone dextronicol concentrated solution for injection, 15ml / time (37.5mg / time, of which edaravone 30mg, (+)-2-camphol 7.5mg), that is, 3 bottles / time, 2 times a day, for 12±2 days;\n\nControl group:\n\nEqual dose of placebo, 15 ml / time, that is, 3 sticks / time, 2 times a day for 12±2 days.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":212,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Edaravone Dexborneol group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this arm will be given Edaravone Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for injection twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Edaravone Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for injection"]},{"label":"Edaravone Dexborneol Placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this arm will be given a placebo of Edaravone Dexborneol for injection twice a day for 10 to 14 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Edaravone Dexborneol placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edaravone Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for injection","description":"Edaravone and Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for Injection, 15 ml (37.5 mg, containing edaravone 30 mg and dexborneol 7.5 mg) in 3 ampoule bottles, twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Edaravone Dexborneol group"],"otherNames":["Xian Bi Xin,CFDA Approval Number H20200007"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edaravone Dexborneol placebo","description":"Edaravone and Dexborneol placebo, 15 ml in 3 ampoule bottles, twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Edaravone Dexborneol Placebo group"],"otherNames":["Xian Bi Xin placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"A 90-day mRS score of 0 to 2 in participants with acute ischaemic stroke","description":"To assess the proportion of participants (early and late) who started edaravone dextrol compared with placebo with a 90-day mRS score of 0 to 2 in participants with acute ischaemic stroke","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological recovery","description":"The difference value of the NIHSS between Day 14/Day 90 and the baseline.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale","description":"used to evaluate the functional outcomes after AIS，good prognosis (mRS score 0-2), generally good prognosis (mRS score 3-4) , Poor prognosis (mRS \\>4 points).","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Quality of life score (EQ-5D)","description":"Generic health status evaluated by EQ-5D questionnaire at the end of the therapy.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The incidence of serious adverse events","description":"The percentage of the Severity Adverse Events within the 14 days/90 days of the therapy.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality","description":"All-cause mortality at 90 days after randomization","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18-80 years old, gender is not limited;\n* Clinically confirmed acute ischemic stroke;\n* Within 6 hours of the onset of this stroke;\n* NIHSS score of 4-24 at enrollment;\n* mRS score before onset≤ 1 point;\n* Subject and subject's agent are able and willing to sign informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* CT indicates intracranial hemorrhagic diseases, such as hemorrhagic stroke, subdural hematoma, ventricular hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, etc.;\n* Previously known severe liver or kidney insufficiency (ALT or AST is greater than 3.0×ULN;
