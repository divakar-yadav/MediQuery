The aim of the research was to examine the balance of the body in patients after a stroke and to determine how the tension of selected muscles of the cervical spine changes under the conditions of statics and dynamics, depending on the visual control or its absence.","detailedDescription":"This is an observational study. The tests were performed with the use of tools and devices such as the Unterberger test, Biodex SD balance platform, and Luna EMG. The static equilibrium was assessed on a balance platform (stability test). The dynamic equilibrium was tested in the Unterberger test and on the balance platform (the fall risk test). All examinations were performed twice with eyes open and then closed. Additionally, during the tests, the tension of selected muscles of the cervical spine was recorded (the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the long neck muscle) (independent variables). It was examined how the intervention, static position, and dynamic displacement of the center of body mass, as well as the control and lack of eye control, influence the tension of selected muscles, and how the eyesight influences the body's balance in statics and dynamics (dependent variables). A group of healthy people was examined to assess whether neurological deficits in people after stroke could affect the results of static and dynamic balance and changes in muscle tone and whether the organ of vision plays a large role in controlling the center of body mass."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy"],"keywords":["stroke,","CAA,","upper limb,","trunk exercises,","stabilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Balance in CAA","description":"Each of the examined post-stroke patients (CAA) performed the given test twice, with the eyes open the first time and the eyes closed the second time.

Moreover, both during the Unterberger functional test and the tests on the Biodex SD balance platform, the muscle tone was assessed in the subjects using the Luna EMG device. Before starting the tests, surface electrodes were glued to the patient's body (according to the SENIAM procedure). Five surface electrodes were used, consisting of three channels. They were placed on the abdomen of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, two more were placed on the left longus colli muscle, and one reference electrode on the right shoulder process of the scapula.
