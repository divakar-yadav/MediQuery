The study is not designed to establish efficacy, although preliminary explorations will be conducted.","detailedDescription":"This is a first-in-human (FIH) study of 42037788 (referred to as CNTO 0007), a cell therapy being tested to see if it may be useful in treating patients with ischemic cerebral infarction also known as stroke. Patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive a single dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo (identical in appearance to CNTO 0007 but does not contain cells) by intravenous (IV) infusion (injection directly into a vein). Patients and study staff will not know if patients are assigned CNTO 0007 or the placebo. The study will be conducted in 2 stages (Stage A and Stage B). In Stage A, the highest dose of CNTO 0007 that does not cause unacceptable side effects, referred to as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined to and administered to patients in Stage B of the study. In Stage A, 5 (up to 7) cohorts (groups) of 4-8 patients each will be administered a single IV infusion of CNTO 0007 or placebo 1-5 days (depending on cohort) after stroke (the first cohort of patients will receive the lowest dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo and each subsequent cohort will be administered a higher dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo until the MTD is determined). In Stage B, patients will be administered a single IV infusion of the MTD within a specified number of days after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemia","Infarction"],"keywords":["Ischemic Cerebral Infarction","Stroke","CNTO0007","42037788"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"001","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CNTO 0007 or placebo (Stage A) a single IV infusion of a selected dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo administered IV within 1-5 days (depending on cohort) after stroke (first cohort of patients will receive the lowest dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo and each subsequent group will be administered a higher dose (to be determined)","interventionNames":["Drug: CNTO 0007 or placebo (Stage A)"]},{"label":"002","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CNTO 0007 or placebo (Stage B) a single IV infusion of the MTD of CNTO 0007 or placebo administered IV within a specified number of days after stroke","interventionNames":["Drug: CNTO 0007 or placebo (Stage B)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"CNTO 0007 or placebo (Stage A)","description":"a single IV infusion of a selected dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo administered IV within 1-5 days (depending on cohort) after stroke (first cohort of patients will receive the lowest dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo and each subsequent group will be administered a higher dose (to be determined)","armGroupLabels":["001"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"CNTO 0007 or placebo (Stage B)","description":"a single IV infusion of the MTD of CNTO 0007 or placebo administered IV within a specified number of days after stroke","armGroupLabels":["002"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The number and type of adverse events reported","timeFrame":"Up to 90 days following study drug administration"},{"measure":"Changes in clinical laboratory test values","timeFrame":"Up to 90 days following study drug administration"},{"measure":"Changes in vital signs measurements","timeFrame":"Up to 90 days following study drug administration"},{"measure":"Changes in electrocardiograms","timeFrame":"Up to 90 days following study drug administration"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood concentration of CNTO 0007","timeFrame":"At protocol-specified time points on Day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke, as defined by the protocol (If a woman, must be postmenopausal, defined as having no menses for the 18 months before study start.
