It is highly prevalent, the prevalence may be increasing, and it is a risk factor for several adverse health outcomes, especially coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and decline in cognitive function. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) is a 2-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a treatment program aimed at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a lower goal than currently recommended will reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.","detailedDescription":"SPRINT strived to enroll about 9250 participants aged ≥ 50 years with SBP ≥130 mm Hg and at least one additional CVD risk factor. The trial compared the effects of randomization to a treatment program of an intensive SBP goal with randomization to a treatment program of a standard goal. Target SBP goals were \\<120 vs \\<140 mm Hg, respectively, to create a minimum mean difference of 10 mm Hg between the two randomized groups. The primary hypothesis was that CVD event rates would be lower in the intensive arm. Participants were recruited at approximately 90 clinics within 5 clinical center networks (CCNs) over approximately a 2-year period, and were followed for 4-6 years.\n\nA total of 9361 participants were enrolled. NIH stopped the blood pressure intervention earlier than originally planned in order to quickly disseminate the significant preliminary results. Follow-up for cognitive and kidney outcomes continues during the post-intervention phase through May 2018."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension"],"keywords":["blood pressure","antihypertensive","systolic","diastolic","heart failure","myocardial infarction","stroke","chronic kidney disease","dementia","cognitive decline"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9361,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive Control of SBP","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized into the Intensive BP arm will have a goal of SBP \\<120 mm Hg. 2-drug therapy initiated in most Intensive participants; age ≥75 years and SBP 130-139 mm Hg on 0-1 drug; may begin with 1 drug, but add second at 1 month if SBP ≥130 mm Hg; drugs added and/or titrated at each visit (monthly) to achieve SBP \\<120 mm Hg; at periodic \"milepost\" visits: addition of another drug \"required\" if not at goal.","interventionNames":["Drug: Intensive control of SBP"]},{"label":"Standard Control of SBP","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants randomized into the Standard arm will have a goal of SBP \\<140 mm Hg.
