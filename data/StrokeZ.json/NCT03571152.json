As a consequence of stroke, patients show a certain degree of dependence and spend most of their time with a caregiver, especially since the subacute phase of the stroke. 80% of patients who survive have motor problems. The proper care during the first three months will significantly improve until 95% the patient rehabilitation. Caregivers have reported the need for information about clinical, prevention and treatment of stroke, like information about specific tasks of patient care, mobilizations, exercises, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to train and educate the caregivers in physical aspects of care, recovery and secondary prevention. However, oversaturated health systems, insufficient number of specialists, social inequity, limited coverage and speed of access to health services are factors that make difficult to educate caregivers. Studies have demonstrated that the Information Technology applied to health is a promising solution to educate and empower the patient, carer and family. For instance, the use of educational videos to improve the level of practice or knowledge of patients with chronic pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the use of educational videos for caregivers of patients in subacute phase of stroke through of the change of the level of practice, knowledge and satisfaction.","detailedDescription":"Sample size A sample size of 10 participants, it is possible to detect minimum differences of 10% to 20%, with standard deviations of 5% to 10%.\n\nStatistical analysis plan The data collected will be entered into a database in Microsoft Excel, to be analyzed by the Epi Info statistical program. The qualitative variables will be analyzed by frequencies and percentages, the quantitative variables by arithmetic mean and standard deviation, some of them categorized for its interpretation. The bivariate analysis between two qualitative variables will be carried out using Fisher's exact test, the analysis between a qualitative variable and a quantitative one will be carried out through the Mann-Whitney U tests (non-normal distribution) and Student's t test (normal distribution). After the intervention, the level of practice and knowledge of the caregivers on the basic management of patients in the subacute phase of the stroke will generate a variable called \"change of score\", whose p-value should be less than 0.05.\n\nPlan for missing data Due to the characteristics of the intervention, the investigators do not expect much loss to follow up patients after recruitment. However, all missing data will be reported as such."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Caregivers","Educational videos","Subacute phase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Pre-experimental study design The level of practice and knowledge of the caregiver will be evaluated according to the video(s) corresponding to the session.
