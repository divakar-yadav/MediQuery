Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown effects on cortical plasticity. We investigate whether combination of TMS and taVNS is more effective at motor cortex excitability than either modality alone.","detailedDescription":"The investigators aim to determine the effects of taVNS on motor cortex excitability. The hypothesis is that taVNS alone (sham rTMS + active taVNS) will induce increases in motor cortex excitability (post-stimulation compared to baseline). The investigators expect these changes will be of a lesser magnitude than those of TMS alone (active rTMS + sham taVNS) due to the indirect mechanistic approach of taVNS. Another aim is to determine whether taVNS-paired TMS is more effective at inducing cortical excitability than TMS alone, as it is hypothesized that pairing two forms of neuromodulation (active rTMS + active taVNS) will increase TMS-induced cortical excitability in the motor cortex when compared to single modality approaches (active rTMS + sham taVNS; sham rTMS + active taVNS). Furthermore, it is expected that this increase is timing sensitive, and the paired approach will induce larger TMS-induced cortical excitability compared to unpaired neuromodulation (active taVNS + active taVNS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Sequelae","Motor Activity"],"keywords":["stroke","recovery","TMS","VNS","motor","motor cortex"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active taVNS, Active TMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Device: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)"]},{"label":"Sham taVNS, Active TMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Device: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)"]},{"label":"Active taVNS, Sham TMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Device: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)"]},{"label":"Sham taVNS, Sham TMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Device: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","description":"transcranial magnetic stimulation delivers magnetic pulses to the brain through the scalp/skull","armGroupLabels":["Active taVNS, Active TMS","Active taVNS, Sham TMS","Sham taVNS, Active TMS","Sham taVNS, Sham TMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)","description":"non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation delivers electricity to the ear","armGroupLabels":["Active taVNS, Active TMS","Active taVNS, Sham TMS","Sham taVNS, Active TMS","Sham taVNS, Sham TMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean change of EMG-recorded Motor-evoked potential from baseline to immediately after intervention","description":"The study uses Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), which are EMG measurements of a targeted movement (in other words, electromyography on the thenar muscles will sense a \"twitch\" that may occur due to motor cortex stimulation by TMS). The sensitivity of the motor cortex to stimulation is correlated to the degree of thumb twitch. This MEP will be used as a functional measure of changes in motor cortex excitability, as the amount of muscle twitch (MEP) should change if the cortex is more sensitive to TMS stimulation.
