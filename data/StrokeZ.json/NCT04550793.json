It also interferes with quality of life of patients severely. Currently first line clinical approach to spasticity consist of physical therapy and pharmacological management. However, there are still some refractory cases that needed local intervention such as Botox injection.\n\nSo far, we only can use subjective methods to measure muscle tension, such as modified Ashworth scale and Tone Assessment Scale. In our previous study, we found that ultrasound shear wave image could correlate with muscle stiffness caused by poststroke spasticity. With this new method, we aim to establish a more objective method in measuring abnormal poststroke muscle tension before and after treatments and further monitor therapeutic effect. We also include several assessment scales to evaluate the correlation between measured muscle spasm and activity of daily living.\n\nWe hypothesize that the rheological changes in muscles muscle spasm after Botox injection can be detected by ultrasound shear wave image. Therapeutic effect can also be seen in its effect on daily functions.\n\nIn this project, we will use shear wave imaging of ultrasound to investigate the elasticity (and hardness) of the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle in stroke patients with unilateral hemiplegia before and after Botox injection. The findings of this project will provide the objective evaluation of muscle spasticity and its correlation with functional status, which will provide new points of view toward treatment of spasticity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity, Muscle","Botulism","Ultrasound","Activity of Daily
