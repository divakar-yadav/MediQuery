In the study, the RLIC treatment will be comprised of 5 cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia and reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["cerebral atherosclerotic occlusion","remote ischemic conditioning","ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":700,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experiment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Doctormate®+Medical Management"]},{"label":"Control","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Drug: Medical Management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Doctormate®+Medical Management","description":"Patients will be treated with Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (200mmHg) twice daily and conventional medication for 3 months.","armGroupLabels":["Experiment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Medical Management","description":"Patients will be treated with conventional medication for 3 months.","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"3-month composite cardio-cerebral vascular event rate","timeFrame":"During the first 3 months from randomization."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence of TIA or infarction rate in the area of responsible vessel domination within 3 months","timeFrame":"During the first 3 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) within 3 months","timeFrame":"During the first 3 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Changes in modified Rankin Scale(mRS) within 3 months","timeFrame":"During the first 3 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Changes in Barthel Index(BI) within 3 months","timeFrame":"During the first 3 months from randomization."},{"measure":"12-month composite cardio-cerebral vascular event rate","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
