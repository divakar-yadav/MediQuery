Half of the subjects will undergo fever prevention using a targeted temperature management system and half of the subjects will be treated for fever should it develop.","detailedDescription":"Multiple studies demonstrate that fever / elevated temperature is associated with poor outcomes in brain injured patients; however, there are no conclusive studies that demonstrate that fever prevention/controlled normothermia is associated with better outcomes. This study will be conducted to assess the impact of advanced temperature control to prevent fever in brain injured patients. The fever prevention group will use the Arctic Sun Temperature Management System and will be compared to standard care patients in whom fever may spontaneously develop. If fever develops in a patient in the standard care group, they will be treated with standard fever care measures according to a step-wise algorithm, consisting primarily of intermittent antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) and cooling blankets and, when necessary, advanced targeted temperature management devices."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fever","Ischemic Stroke","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Targeted Temperature Management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":686,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fever Prevention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fever will be prevented using a surface targeted temperature management system","interventionNames":["Device: Targeted Temperature Management"]},{"label":"Standard Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard care in which fever may spontaneously develop","interventionNames":["Other: Standard Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Targeted Temperature Management","description":"Prophylactic normothermia","armGroupLabels":["Fever Prevention"],"otherNames":["Arctic Sun 5000 Temperature Management System"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard Care","description":"No intervention to control temperature unless fever occurs","armGroupLabels":["Standard Care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fever Burden","description":"Daily average fever burden (°C-hour)","timeFrame":"Up to 14 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary Neurologic Outcome: Modified Rankin Scale Short-Term","description":"Modified Rankin Scale is a 6-category outcome measurement with 0 = no limitations, no symptoms and 6 = death.","timeFrame":"3-months post injury"},{"measure":"Other Neurologic Outcomes: NIH Stroke Scale Short-Term","description":"NIH Stroke Scale is a systematic, quantitative assessment tool to measure stroke-related neurological deficit.
