Strengthening the comprehensive management of the high-risk population of stroke, improving the medication compliance of patients and the control rate of stroke risk factors play a key role in reducing stroke recurrence.\n\nThis study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind study, which aims to use the tool of WeChat Mini Programs to realize the post-hospital follow-up management of the high-risk population of stroke. The follow-up time is 12 months. The main measurement result was the change of patients' medication compliance after comprehensive management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"],"keywords":["Stroke","Management","Social Networks"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":720,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard group","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients are managed according to the routine methods after enrollment.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Routine post-hospital follow-up management"]},{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients are managed by the social network platform.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Post-hospital management based on WeChat applet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Post-hospital management based on WeChat applet","description":"The brain and heart health manager uses the exclusive QR code in the WeChat applet to receive and manage patients.
