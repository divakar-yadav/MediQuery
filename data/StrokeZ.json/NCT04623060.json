Lower limb's resistance training alone in chronic stroke produces a large effect on muscle strength. However, it has shown uncertainty results on walking performance. Therefore, it is suggested that to prescribe mix training (treadmill training and strength training) in order to improve muscle strength, gait performance and quality of life in stroke survivors. Previous studies have shown the effect of mixed training on walking performance and endurance in other populations such as multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease. However, there is a lack of study that conducted mixed training among chronic post-stroke. Therefore, the feasibility study on the effectiveness of combining LV-ITT and RE in post-stroke should be conducted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Low-Volume Interval Training","Resistance Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"3 sessions/week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: Combination of Low-volume interval treadmill training and Resistance Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Combination of Low-volume interval treadmill training and Resistance Training","description":"Low-volume interval training (LV-ITT) protocols included a 5 min warm-up (30%-50%VO2peak) up to 20min of LV-ITT and a 5 min cooling down (30%-50% VO2peak).

Each time the participants completed a burst successfully, treadmill speed will be increased by 0.1 mph for the next burst. The recovery periods will be 4 minutes. The intervention will be conducted for about 30 minutes.\n\nResistance training will be conducted by using a horizontal leg press machine.
