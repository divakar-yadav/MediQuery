Identify the predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation after discharge from hospital.\n2. Identify the frequency of readmission to hospital, or other resource use such as Emergency Department or outpatient visit, for the treatment or prophylaxis of postoperative AF and consequent stroke or bleeding outcomes.\n3. Identify the risks for stroke, death and other morbidity in patients after cardiac surgery and the effect of postoperative AF upon subsequent stroke or bleeding outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke, Acute","Death"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Massachusetts","description":"No interventions.
