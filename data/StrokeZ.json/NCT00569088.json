But in internal intractable diseases, such as viral hepatitis, stroke, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever, blood stasis and blood heat always accompany with each other. So the hypothesis is raised that blood stasis with heat (YURE) is a compound pathogen and key pathogenesis in internal intractable diseases. This study was aimed to verify the role that the compound pathogen played in hemorrhagic stroke and to observe the progress of the key pathogenesis. A randomized and controlled trial would be conducted in five hospitals, where 300 hospitalized patients with hemorrhagic stroke in the acute phase would receive different intervention with basic modern medicine treatment or Chinese herbs formula combined with the former. The Chinese herbs formula, which was designed under the guidance of the theory system of Chinese Medicine, was supposed to cool blood heat and dissolve blood stasis. Clinical efficacy and safety would be evaluated after the 21-days intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["hemorrhagic stroke","Chinese Medicine","pathogenesis","YURE"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A combined treatment would be used in the arm.That means Chinese herb formula would be used with the current Modern Medicine therapy for stroke in this arm.","interventionNames":["Drug: Chinese herbs formula"]},{"label":"A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"just the current Modern Medicine therapy for stroke would be available in the arm.","interventionNames":["Drug: Mannitol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chinese herbs formula","description":"The chinese herbs formula includes eight herbs,and they are Radix et Rhizoma Rhei Palmati(Rhubarb,10 grams),Cornu Bubali(Buffalo Horn,30 grams),Radix Paeoniae Bubra(Red Peony Root,15 grams),Cortex Moutan Radicis(Tree Peony Root-bark,10 grams),Radix Rehmanniae(Adhesive Rehmannia Root Tuber,20 grams),Pheretima Aspergillum(Earth-worm,10 grams),Radix Notoginseng(Sanchi,5 grams)and Rhizoma Acori Tarainowii(Tararinow Sweetflag Rhizome,10 grams).\n\nBoiled together. 150ml of the juice,p.o.,twice a day,for 28 days","armGroupLabels":["B"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Mannitol","description":"250 ml Mannitol Injection or Glycerin and Fructose Injection ,once a day, for 3-5 days","armGroupLabels":["A"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Chinese symptoms","timeFrame":"21 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"blood loss determined by brain CT","timeFrame":"21 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* clinical diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke\n* hospitalized in 48 hours after hemorrhagic stroke happens\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\n* intracranial hemorrhage caused by tumor, trauma or blood diseases","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Fang Ye, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8625-86798189","email":"yeflm@yahoo.com.cn"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mianhua Wu, Dr.","affiliation":"Nanjing Uinversity of Traditional Chinese Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Institute of Internal Intractable Diseases, Nanjing University of Traditonal Chinese Medicine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Nanjing","state":"Jiangsu","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Fan Ye, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8625-86798189","email":"yeflm@yahoo.com.cn"},{"name":"Mianhua Wu, Dr.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Xueping Zhou, Dr.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Weifeng Guo, Dr.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Xizheng Gu, Dr.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.06167,"lon":118.77778}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2405","name":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000008353","term":"Mannitol"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000004234","term":"Diuretics, Osmotic"},{"id":"D000004232","term":"Diuretics"},{"id":"D000045283","term":"Natriuretic Agents"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M11032","name":"Mannitol","asFound":"Behavioral intervention","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7101","name":"Diuretics","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T107","name":"Chinese Rhubarb","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"NaAg","name":"Natriuretic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"HB","name":"Herbal and Botanical"}]}},"hasResults":false}
