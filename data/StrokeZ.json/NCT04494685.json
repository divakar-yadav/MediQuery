In this randomized controlled trial the patients will be allocated to a control group (which will receive conventional physiotherapy) or or to intervention group (which will receive conventional physiotherapy and robotic rehabilitation). Interventions will occur every day in the hospital phase and three times/week after discharge, totaling 18 sessions.The groups will be evaluated prior to any physiotherapy intervention, in the 10h session and at the end of six weeks of treatment (or 18 sessions).The following outcomes will be measured: functionality, peripheral muscle strength, muscle architecture and echogenicity, spasticity, cardiorespiratory repercussions, mobility, disability and dependence, quality of life and time of hospital stay."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Robotics","Electric stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Robotic rehabilitation with Erigo® equipment (Hocoma, Volketswil, Switzerland).","interventionNames":["Device: Intervention group (Robotic rehabilitation)"]},{"label":"Conventional physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The protocol will be based on lower limb exercises, aiming at maintaining and gaining muscle strength through passive, assisted or active mobilization, when possible, on the affected side.","interventionNames":["Other: Control group (Conventional physiotherapy)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intervention group (Robotic rehabilitation)","description":"Robotic rehabilitation with Erigo® equipment (Hocoma, Volketswil, Switzerland).
