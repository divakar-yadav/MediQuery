Caregivers are routinely engaged during hospital discharge for education and training related to the person with stroke. However, the critical period after stroke survivor's discharge is largely unsupported for the caregiver. This proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that will provide post-discharge support for caregivers using a health coaching program as compared to usual care and examine its effect of caregivers and people with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Caregiver strain reduces quality of life and can increase the chance of unplanned hospital readmission for the person with stroke. Caregivers are routinely engaged during hospital discharge for education and training. However, the critical period after discharge is largely unsupported. The proposed research will integrate occupational therapy and telehealth to provide a post-discharge, caregiver-focused program, the \"Health Coaching-in-Context\" that consists of up to 10 sessions, arranged once-a-week or multiple times a week based on convenience of scheduling for up to 10 weeks. The program targets improved caregiver health and reduction in readmissions for stroke survivor. The study aims to examine the effects of the coaching program for caregivers as compared to usual care and evaluate the feasibility of study design. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted with two parallel groups, \"Health Coaching-in-Context\" and usual care. A sample of up to 40 pairs, including up to 40 stroke survivors and their respective 40 caregivers will be recruited from University hospitals and randomly assigned after consenting. The occupational therapist, unaware of the group assignment, will administer assessments before and after the intervention, and at 4-week follow-up. Data will be collected on general information, readmissions, performance, self-efficacy, and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Caregiver Stress Syndrome","Caregiver Burnout","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Caregiver","Stroke","Coaching","Stress","Self-efficacy","Re-admission","Burden"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Single-blind randomized controlled trial design with two parallel groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessor will be blinded to treatment group allocation","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Coaching","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Health Coaching-in-Context\" includes coaching by trained coaches up to 10 sessions over teleconference.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Coaching"]},{"label":"Usual Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The usual care group does not get any intervention but continues with any of their usual activities that would otherwise would have been provided to them."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Coaching","description":"\"Health Coaching-in-Context\" that consists of up to 10 sessions, arranged once-a-week or multiple times a week based on convenience of scheduling for up to 10 weeks.
