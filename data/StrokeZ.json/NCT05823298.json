One of the most common motor problems following a stroke is hemiplegia, which makes it challenging for the patient to perform activities of daily living and ambulation. Understanding the mechanisms of motor control and motor learning, which are vital components of stroke rehabilitation, necessitates the assessment of motor function. For evaluating motor function in stroke patients, there are numerous outcome measures available. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) stands out when comparison of these assessments in terms of clinical and psychometric values. There is no official FMA version that has been translated into Turkish, even though Fugl-Meyer assessment is used in numerous research in Turkey. The aim of this study is to adapt the Fugl-Meyer assessment to Turkish culture and to test its validity and reliability in acute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Cerebrovascular; Disorder, Acute"],"keywords":["acute stroke","fugl-meyer assessment","upper extremity","lower extremity","outcome assessment","stroke rehabilitation","translation and cross-cultural adaptation","validity","reliability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel Index","description":"a scale used to assess functional independence.
