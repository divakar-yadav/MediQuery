In the first part of the study, half of CKD participants will be randomly assigned to ticagrelor and aspirin, while the other half will be assigned to clopidogrel and aspirin in a blinded fashion. The treatment duration will be two weeks. After recruiting CKD participants the investigator will recruit controls with normal kidney function that will receive only ticagrelor and aspirin for two weeks.","detailedDescription":"It is known that people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk to have heart and blood vessel problems like heart attack and stroke compared to people that do not have kidney problems. Aspirin, clopidogrel and ticagrelor prevent blood clots building up in the vessels. If a blood clot is present in one vessel, it could stop oxygen carrying blood to get to a specific organ, and that could cause problems like heart attack or stroke. There is very little knowledge about the way this group of medicines works in people with chronic kidney disease as well as it works in individuals with normal kidney function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Kidney Diseases","Heart Attack","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["P2Y12 inhibitors","Platelet aggregation","ticagrelor","clopidogrel","chronic kidney disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"CKD participants will be double-blind randomized in these two arms:\n\nArm 1 - Ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily (one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening) + Aspirin 81 mg/day.
