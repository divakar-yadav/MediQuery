And evaluating the risk of hemorrhagic and non- hemorrhagic complications associated with the use of ticagrelor180 ml oral loading dose within 9 hours acute ischemic stroke","detailedDescription":"ticagrelor is acyclo-pentyltriazolo-pyrimidine antiplatelet drug that inhibits the P2Y12which is a subtype of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)receptor.\n\nIt is a potent , direct-acting oral agent and it is reversibly binding P2Y12 receptors antagonist unlike the irreversible agents as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine.\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the blood-thinning drug (ticagrelor) to treat acute coronary syndromes, and in 2015, it approved it as long-term treatment in patient with history of heart attack.\n\nIn 2018, the American Heart Association ( AHA ) and American stroke Association (ASA) Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke stated that, ticagrelor was not found to be superior to aspirin. However, because there were no significant safety differences, ticagrelor may be a reasonable alternative in stroke patients who have a contraindication to aspirin.\n\nAspirin overall reduces the risk of major vascular events by 13% Moreover, the risk of hemorrhagic events limits the use of aspirin in this setting, so the investigators aim at examining the hemorrhagic risks associated with use of loading Ticagrelor 180 ml within 9 hours of 1st ever acute ischemic stroke and compare the neurological outcomes in two groups of patients with 1st ever acute ischemic stroke receiving within 9 hours either Aspirin(300 mg (4 tablets of 75 mg) as a single loading oral dose, and will then be commenced on 300 mg Aspirin daily for 2 weeks then 75 mg daily after that for 3 months and the other received 180 mg ticagrelor (2 tablets of 90 mg) as a single loading oral dose, and continue on 180 mg ticagrelor (1 tablet of 90 mg every 12 hours) for 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ticagrelol","aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be divided into 2 groups.
