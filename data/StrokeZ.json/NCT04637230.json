Heart rhythms of interest are normal sinus rhythm (SR), atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial premature beats (APBs), ventricular premature beats (VPBs), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Per diagnosis, 20,000 ECGs are required, for a total of 100,000 ECGs to be obtained from approximately 10,000 subjects/patients.","detailedDescription":"In phase 1 of a research project titled 'Prevention of stroke and sudden cardiac death by Recording of 1-Channel Electrocardiograms' (PRICE), a total of 100,000 30-sec single-channel ECGs (lead I of 12-lead surface ECG) will be collected from approximately 10,000 subjects/patients at 11 participating clinical centers in Germany. Relevant baseline clinical patient characteristics will also be recorded. The ECGs, diagnosed by an experienced electrophysiologist (diagnostic gold standard), will be fed into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the automatic detection of normal sinus rhythm (SR), atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial premature beats (APBs), ventricular premature beats (VPBs), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). It is expected that the overall diagnostic accuracy of the AI against an experienced electrophysiologist will be on the order of 95%.\n\nIn PRICE phase 2, ECG diagnosis by the AI will be compared with the diagnosis by 3 general cardiologists of the same ECGs. It is expected that the AI will surpass the general cardiologists in terms of diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe final clinical phase of the PRICE project will comprise a randomized controlled community trial of risk patients to establish the superiority in stroke prevention of AI detection of AF on smart-watch ECGs vs. no AF detection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sinus Rhythm","Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Premature Complexes","Ventricular Premature Complexes","Ventricular Tachycardia, Nonsustained"],"keywords":["Automated ECG diagnosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sinus Rhythm","description":"Subjects/patients in normal sinus rhythm","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Electrocardiogram analysis by Artificial Intelligence"]},{"label":"Atrial Fibrillation","description":"Patients with atrial fibrillation","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Electrocardiogram analysis by Artificial Intelligence"]},{"label":"Atrial Premature Complexes","description":"Patients with atrial premature complexes in between sinus beats","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Electrocardiogram analysis by Artificial Intelligence"]},{"label":"Ventricular Premature Complexes","description":"Patients with ventricular premature complexes in between sinus beats","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Electrocardiogram analysis by Artificial Intelligence"]},{"label":"Ventricular Tachycardia, Nonsustained","description":"Patients with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in between sinus beats","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Electrocardiogram analysis by Artificial Intelligence"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Electrocardiogram analysis by Artificial Intelligence","description":"1-channel electrocardiograms are collected to train an Artificial Intelligence in the automatic diagnosis of regular and irregular heart rhythms","armGroupLabels":["Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Premature Complexes","Sinus Rhythm","Ventricular Premature Complexes","Ventricular Tachycardia, Nonsustained"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic accuracy of AI","description":"Overall diagnostic accuracy of the AI in the diagnosis of normal SR, AF, APBs, VPBs, and nonsustained VT (gold standard: diagnosis by experienced electrophysiologist)","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"ECG R-R interval","description":"30-sec mean and standard deviation of R-R intervals","timeFrame":"Immediate"},{"measure":"ECG QRS-complex duration","description":"Measurement of width/duration of QRS complex;
