It is unclear whether acute stroke patients can acquire new motor skills with their affected upper limb. The aims of this research program are:\n\n1. To test the capacity of acute stroke patients (\\< 21 days) to learn and retain a complex unimanual motor skill.\n2. To explore whether acute stroke to different brain regions (quantified with brain MRI) induces specific deficits in motor skill learning.\n3. To compare acute stroke patients with healthy individuals and with chronic stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Over 3 consecutive days, the subjects will be evaluated and will train on the rehabilitation robot REAplan® (http://www.axinesis.com/). They will practice 2 serious games on the robot.\n\nIn order to differentiate the effect of motor control recovery from that of MskL, the acute stroke patients will be randomised 4/1 to \"MskL\" (n=120) ,to \"motor control recovery\" (n=30) or to \"conventional\" group (n=15) with a minimisation software. The experimental design will be similar except that the \"motor control recovery\" group will practice the serious game EASY instead of CIRCUIT (see below) and the \"conventional\" group will practice conventional therapy instead of CIRCUIT. The performances on both EASY \\& CIRCUIT will be compared between groups (subjects in both groups will perform the EASY \\& CIRCUIT tasks).The total time of rehabilitation will be the same.\n\nThe motor skill learning setup (CIRCUIT + EASY) that we developed and successfully used in healthy individuals and stroke patients has already been implemented in the REAplan environment and will be used as innovative serious games based on a speed/accuracy trade-off (SAT), allowing a detailed analysis of motor skill learning components (speed, accuracy, SAT, movement smoothness, dynamics...). For the serious game CIRCUIT, who based on motor skill learning, the subjects will have to practice a complex circuit and move as a cursor quickly and accurately as possible by controlling the handle of the robot with their affected hand/arm. For the other task EASY (a brick busters serious game), the aim will be to go back and forth between walls presented in different locations. The CONVENTIONAL therapy will consist in classical exercices focused in the upper limb administered by occupational therapist.\n\nThe subacute stroke phase is a unique opportunity to investigate the role of brain structures in motor learning/control. Compared to chronic impairments (\\> 6 months post-stroke), the subacute phase provides a window into how a lesion perturbs sensorimotor functions prior to reorganisation driven by plasticity and neurorehabilitation. To clarify the role of different brain structures in MskL, Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) based on high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, will be used to analyse the relationship between tissue damage and MskL scores on a voxel-by-voxel basis.\n\nIn addition, several \"classical\" clinical scales and tests will be used to evaluate overall motor-sensory-cognitive functions. The subjects will practice serious games on the robot REAplan (R), requiring movements with the affected arm (unimanual tasks).\n\nAnd, we used a Dextrain® tool which allows quantification of key components of manual dexterity : forces, selectivity (independance of fingers movement) and coactivation of the fingers.Moreover, we added a Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as a tool for predicting recovery of motor function after stroke.\n\nIn addition to the (sub)acute stroke patients, 4 others groups will be recruited for this study : a group of acute stroke patients who will receive \"conventional rehabilitation\" and be shortly tested on the robot (N=15), a group of chronic stroke patients (stroke \\> 6 months) who will not be hospitalized and will not undergo MRI (N=30), a group of healthy individuals who will not undergo MRI (N=50) and a group of patients with a transient global amnesia which is a sudden, temporary episode (\\<24hours) of memory loss (N=15).\n\nSubjects in these 4 groups will be randomized 1/1 in the two arms (\"MSkL\" versus \"motor control recovery\" arms), except the patients with a TGA who will be included in the \"MSkL\" arm only."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Acute stroke","Motor skill learning","Upper limb","Rehabilitation","Subacute stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":245,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Motor Skill Learning (CIRCUIT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: training on the REAplan robot with a serious game based on motor skill learning (MSkL) serious game, the CIRCUIT.","interventionNames":["Device: REAplan(R)"]},{"label":"Motor control recovery (EASY)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Training on the REAplan robot with a serious game that requires similar type and amount of movements but does not rely on motor skill learning (EASY), a brick buster game.","interventionNames":["Device: REAplan(R)"]},{"label":"Conventional","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Training sessions with classical exercices focused on the upper limb administered by occupation therapist.","interventionNames":["Device: REAplan(R)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"REAplan(R)","description":"motor skill learning with the REAplan(R) rehabilitation robot, to be perfomed with the affected arm","armGroupLabels":["Conventional","Motor Skill Learning (CIRCUIT)","Motor control recovery (EASY)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in SAT (CIRCUIT)","description":"Speed/ Accuracy Trade-off","timeFrame":"change between Baseline Day1 and Day3 (acute) + between Baseline Day1 and 3/6 and 12 months post-stroke (subacute - chronic)"},{"measure":"total distance travelled (EASY)","description":"total distance travelled between the walls of the brick busters (in cm)","timeFrame":"change between Baseline Day1 and Day3 (acute) + between Baseline Day1 and 3/6 and 12 months post-stroke (subacute - chronic)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity Test","description":"Tests impairments of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"change between Baseline Day1 and Day3 (acute) + between Baseline Day1 and 3/6 and 12 months post-stroke (subacute - chronic)"},{"measure":"Arm Motor Ability (AMA) test","description":"Measure disabilities of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"change between Baseline Day1 and Day3 (acute) + between Baseline Day1 and 3/6 and 12 months post-stroke (subacute - chronic)"},{"measure":"Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS)","description":"Visual Analog Scale to evaluate fatigue between 0 and 10.
