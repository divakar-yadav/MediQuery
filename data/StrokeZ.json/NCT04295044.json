However, dehydration is likely to be only a part of representation in poor nutrition status and physical fragility for a stroke patient.\n\nOur prior study found that acute stroke patients admitted to neurological intensive care unit with low urinary creatinine excretion rate (CER), a marker of muscle mass, was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after stroke. An animal study suggested inadequate food and water intake determine mortality following stroke in mice and nutritional support reduced the 14-day mortality rate from 59% to 15%. A study also showed that high protein intake was associated with a better outcome in previous cardiovascular events.\n\nWe will calculate CER based on published equation. Based on our prior study, acute stroke patients with their CER\\<1500 mg/day will be enrolled. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted and patients will be randomly assigned to high protein diet or normal protein diet for at least 2 weeks. We plan to enroll 300 patients, with 150 patients in ach group, during 3-year study period. We will consult dietitians for arrangement of their diet. We assume that patients receiving high protein diet will have higher opportunity to walk independently (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) at 3 month after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Diet, Healthy","Muscle Loss"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High protein diet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"received high protein diet, prescribed by dietitian","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: high protein diet"]},{"label":"Normal protein diet","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"received normal protein diet, prescribed by dietitian","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: normal protein diet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"high protein diet","description":"receive 1.8g protein/kg","armGroupLabels":["High protein diet"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"normal protein diet","description":"receive 1g protein/kg","armGroupLabels":["Normal protein diet"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale 0-1","description":"No significant disability","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale 0-2","description":"Slight disability","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. acute ischemic stroke during hospitalization\n2. eGFR \\>30\n3. urine albumin creatinine ratio \\< 30 mg/g\n4. urinary creatinine excretion rate (CER) \\< 1500g/day\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 (i.e. eGFR \\< 30)\n2. proteinuria (protein 1+ or more in urine routine)\n3. known impairment of functional status (mRS â‰¥ 2) prior to the index stroke\n4. refuse to participate in this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"99 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi Branch","city":"Chiayi City","zip":"613","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":23.47917,"lon":120.44889}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
