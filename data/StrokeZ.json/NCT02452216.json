Imaging features will be correlated with the number of inflammatory cells (macrophages) at histopathology. Determining the extent of inflammation associated with pathologies in the central nervous system may be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes as well as monitoring treatment response of current and future immunotherapies.","detailedDescription":"In this study, we will establish the MR imaging characteristics of macrophages in malignant brain tumors and other CNS conditions in the pediatric and adult populations using ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle that is approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. The investigators will correlate the MR signal of ferumoxytol uptake with the number of macrophages in surgical specimen at histopathology. This information may potentially offer clinicians a new means for risk stratification and monitoring treatment efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injury","Central Nervous System Degenerative Disorder","Central Nervous System Infectious Disorder","Central Nervous System Vascular Malformation","Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular Accident","Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accident","Primary Brain Neoplasm","Brain Cancer","Brain Tumors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ferumoxytol group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All subjects in the experimental arm will have a single intravenous dose of ferumoxytol (5 mg Fe/kg), to be administered 24 hours before the subject undergoes ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
