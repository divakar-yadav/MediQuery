Chronic stenosis in the large cerebral arteries is associated with cerebral hypoperfusion, cognitive decline and an increased risk of stroke or recurrent stroke, respectively.\n\nEven with upgrowth of surgical or endovascular interventions, mechanical reopening of the occluded vessels is often not possible. Alternative treatment opportunities include minimal-to-moderate blood pressure elevation (typically by ceasing antihypertensives) waiting for collateral circulation to develop spontaneously. Another conservative approach to increase cerebral perfusion is aerobic exercising. Physical activity has shown to lead to cerebral blood flow increase, especially in activated brain areas of healthy human and rat models. However, it is remains unknown, how physiological adaptation to physical activity expresses in persons after stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Herein, it is hypothesized that aerobic exercise facilitates the development of an extensive and functional vascular collateral network in persons with ischemic stroke and perfusion compromise."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["cerebral perfusion","aerobic exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"aerobic treadmill training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Progressive graded, high-intensity aerobic treadmill training is delivered over 36 sessions at a frequency of 3x per week for 30-50 minutes of training per session over a period of 3 months.
