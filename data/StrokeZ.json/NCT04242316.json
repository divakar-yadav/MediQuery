This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of MT and bimanual arm training (BAT) in improving motor and functional performance of hemiplegic upper extremity for adults with chronic stroke. Participants with chronic stroke were recruited by convenience sampling from a convalescent hospital and self-help groups in the community in Hong Kong. Participants were randomly assigned to the MT group or BAT group and participated in a 6-week upper limb training programme which consisted of two 45-minute training sessions per week. Both kinds of training were equivalent to each other except that there was a mirror used in the MT group. Main outcome measures were upper extremity motor and functional tests, and grip strength. Participants were evaluated at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. EEG was assessed before and after the training in a group of stroke patients and healthy controls, in order to evaluate the recruitment of the mirror neurons, as reflected in mu rhythm suppression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Mirror therapy","Bilateral arm training","Upper limb function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":101,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients performed customized bimanual upper limb exercises with a mirror.

While watching the reflection of the unaffected hand in the mirror, the patient was then asked to moving the affected hand at the same time to synchronize the movement with the reflection of the unaffected hand.
