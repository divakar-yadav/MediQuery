Treadmill training is a widely used form of treatment and it has been used in subjects with neurological disease to ameliorate walking and balance deficits. The Virtual Reality Treadmill as a therapeutic tool has been recently introduced to practice gait adaptability elicited by aligning foot placement relative to the projected visual context.\n\nForty-eight subjects with neurological disease will receive treadmill training treatment randomly divided in Traditional Treadmill training and Virtual Reality Treadmill training.\n\nThe aim of this randomized controlled study is to assess whether Treadmill training with Virtual Reality is better than Traditional Treadmill training in improving dynamic balance and cognitive aspects in subjects with neurological diseases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Parkinson Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treadmill Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"40' treadmill training walking holding the handrail","interventionNames":["Device: Treadmill training"]},{"label":"Virtual Reality Treadmill Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"40' treadmill training walking with virtual visual and auditory cues","interventionNames":["Device: Virtual Reality Treadmill Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Virtual Reality Treadmill Training","description":"Subjects in the experimental group will receive 40 minutes comprising exercises focused on improving dynamic balance following auditory and visual cues.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual Reality Treadmill Training"],"otherNames":["C-mill treadmill"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Treadmill training","description":"Subjects in the active comparator group will receive 40 minutes walking training aimed to improve velocity and endurance.","armGroupLabels":["Treadmill Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Modified Dynamic Gait Index","description":"Tool used to assess dynamic balance","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline Modified Dynamic Gait Index scores at 3-5 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in the 6 minutes walking test","description":"tool used to assess walking endurance","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline 6 minutes walking test scores at 3-5 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Activity Balance Confidence","description":"Tool used to assess of balance confidence in daily life activities","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline Activity Balance Confidence scores at 3-5 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in 10-meter walking test","description":"Tool used to assess walking speed in 3 different conditions ( normal speed, fastest speed, cognitive dual task)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline10-meter walking test scores at 3-5 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Trial Making test","description":"The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological tapping visual attention and task switching.
