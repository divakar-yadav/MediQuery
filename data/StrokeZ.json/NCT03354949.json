The investigators then had to the participants try positioning equipment and then prescribed it once the choice was made. The investigators then reassessed postural control and wheelchair pain with this positioning equipment.","detailedDescription":"For each hemiplegic participants with wheelchair user stroke, the investigators collect : date of birth, date of stroke, side of hemiplegia. The wheelchair propulsion mode, the degree of autonomy (FAC and Enjalber scales), the way bed - wheelchair transfers are made. Assessment of wheelchair pain in the spine and Ischia with EVA. Time to travel 10 meters in a wheelchair. Postural control of the wheelchair is evaluated by the MCPAA. The investigators then carry out tests of positioning equipment : backrest, cushion, form elements and belt. This material is tried for several days. If it is appropriate (improvement on the postural control and on the pains), otherwise another material is tried.\n\nWhen the choice is made, the material is prescribed. The participant is seen again 3 months after the delivery of his personal material, and the same evaluation is redone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Wheelchair"],"keywords":["Wheelchair","Hemiplegia","Stroke","Postural control","Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Positioning hemiplegic.","description":"Positioning all hemiplegic by stroke requiring a single wheelchair even at the exit of the SSR and hemiplegic patient with sequelae.\n\nMeasurement of sitting postural control of the adult (MCPAA).
