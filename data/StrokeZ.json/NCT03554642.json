Participants will be randomized to receive 30 additional minutes of therapy every day, for a total of 2 weeks (14 days). One group will receive 30 minutes of standard physical therapy focused on pre-gait or gait training activities, while the experimental group will receive 30 minutes of Walkbot with Augmented Reality. Both groups will receive the same time in therapy aimed at gait training.","detailedDescription":"This controlled clinical study will involve 30 ischemic stroke inpatients during their stay at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital (typical inpatient arrives 7 days post-stroke and is admitted for \\~16 days).\n\nStroke inpatients will be sequentially randomized into one of two groups within the first week after admission. Both Groups will receive 30 additional minutes of therapy every day, for a total of 2 weeks (14 days). Group A will enroll 15 patients who will receive usual inpatient care including at least one 60-minute session of physical therapy per day, and an additional 30-minute session of standard physical therapy focused on pre-gait and/or gait training activities 5-days per week during the duration of their stay (14 days). Group B will enroll 15 patients who receive usual inpatient care that includes at least one 60-minute session of physical therapy and an additional 30-minute session of Walkbot with Augmented Reality 5-days per week during the duration of their stay (14 days). Both groups will receive the same time in therapy aimed at gait training. The extra therapy group will not exceed more than 15 minutes of pregait training before starting to walk the patient, and will spend at least 15 minutes doing active gait training per session. Patients in the treatment group will receive 30 minutes of total training on the Walkbot, excluding setup time. Primary and secondary outcomes will be collected, prior to the first therapy session. Follow up outcome measures will be collected within two days after the final interventional (study) therapy session. The amount of therapists needed for each session will be logged for every patient after Walkbot training or extra physical therapy. Borg rating of perceived exertion will be taken after each session from the patients, and NASA Task Load Index will be completed by the therapists (ie therapist load). Outcomes will be analyzed for significant differences."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Sequential randomization into one of two groups within first week after admission.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Walkbot Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive usual inpatient care that includes at least one 60-minute session of physical therapy and an additional 30-minute session of Walkbot with Augmented Reality 5-days per week during the duration of their stay (14 days).","interventionNames":["Device: Walkbot"]},{"label":"Physical Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive usual inpatient care including at least one 60-minute session of physical therapy per day, and an additional 30-minute session of standard physical therapy focused on pre-gait and/or gait training activities 5-days per week during the duration of their stay (14 days).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Physical Therapy"]},{"label":"Usual Care Physical Therapy","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants in this group will receive usual inpatient care including at least one 60-minute session of physical therapy per day."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Walkbot","description":"Walkbot is a Robot Assisted Gait Training System.
