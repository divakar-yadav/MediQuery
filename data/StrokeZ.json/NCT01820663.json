It is based on the hypothesis that after stroke, the brain's utilization of glucose, it's primary source of energy, is disrupted. The MAD is a low-carbohydrate diet that has can switch the body's metabolism from using glucose to using products of fat metabolism, so-called ketones. Ketones may act as an alternative energy substrate for the brain. Ketones also have several neuroprotective effects after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","ketones","ketogenic diet","impairment","disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Modified Atkins Diet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive a 14 day menu consisting of the Modified Atkins diet, a low-carbohydrate, high protein, high fat diet.","interventionNames":["Other: Modified Atkins Diet"]},{"label":"Control Diet","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive a diet (e.g. regular, low cholesterol, diabetic) determined by the attending physician.","interventionNames":["Other: Control diet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Modified Atkins Diet","description":"A high fat, high protein, low- carbohydrate diet","armGroupLabels":["Modified Atkins Diet"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control diet","description":"The control diet is a diet determined by the attending physician caring for the patient and may consist of either a low sodium diet, a low sodium/ low cholesterol diet, a regular diet or a diabetic diet.","armGroupLabels":["Control Diet"],"otherNames":["Low sodium diet","low sodium/ low cholesterol diet","regular diet","diabetic diet"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Motor Score","description":"The Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Motor Score is used to assess impairment in upper extremity function.
