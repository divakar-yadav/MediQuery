Currently, there is still lack of prospective cohort study with large sample size on the relationship between perioperative covert stroke and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The investigators will perform a prospective cohort study. The aim of the study is to determine whether there is an association between perioperative covert stroke and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anesthesia","Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction","Covert Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":934,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Perioperative covert stroke"},{"label":"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of perioperative covert stroke","description":"Stroke is diagnosed by MRI","timeFrame":"Postoperative 3-7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative cognitive function","description":"Cognitive assessment will be conducted by trained research members who are blinded to the clinical diagnosis, treatment and MRI.
