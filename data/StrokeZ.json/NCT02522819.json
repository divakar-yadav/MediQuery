Stroke is a frequent pathology with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Although it has now been proved that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a risk factor of stroke, on the other hand, there is evidence that 50 to 70% of patients in the acute phase of stroke have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) based on an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥ 10. OSA is associated with worse functional outcomes and higher mortality in the post-stroke period. Profound hemodynamic fluctuations and hypoxia generated by sleep apnea are likely to aggravate cerebral ischemia, particularly in the acute phase of stroke in the potentially reversible ischemic penumbra. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nYet, to our knowledge, there have been very few studies aimed at demonstrating the value of CPAP in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in the acute phase of stroke. Only one randomised trial has provided the means to document neurological improvement at mid term (1 month) in a targeted population.\n\nBefore undertaking a comparative study evaluating the efficacy of CPAP in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, it is worth evaluating the feasibility and tolerance of introducing CPAP at the very early stage of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of CPAP in the treatment of OSA in the acute phase of ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome"],"keywords":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome","acute stroke","apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"obstructive sleep apnea in the acute phase of stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Use of CPAP over 5 nights for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in the acute phase of stroke","interventionNames":["Device: CPAP"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"CPAP","description":"Use of CPAP over 5 nights for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in the acute phase of stroke.","armGroupLabels":["obstructive sleep apnea in the acute phase of stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"CPAP feasibility","description":"Number of patients for which CPAP is used for a minimum of 3 hours per night over 5 nights.
