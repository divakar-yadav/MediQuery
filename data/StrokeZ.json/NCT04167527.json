However, acute ischemic stroke patients with low NIHSS who harbor a large vessel occlusion (LVO) later decline in 20-40% of cases, and/or have underappreciated impairments related to their relatively mild strokes. Similarly, LVO patients presenting with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are under increased risk of clinical deterioration. Such patients with apparent good collateral circulation, and hence a substantial perfusion of the vascular territory of the occluded large artery, likely have the most to gain from endovascular revascularization. At the same time, this collateral perfusion may allow for more frequent recanalization, either spontaneously or by intravenous (IV) rtPA. Experience with immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) in the LVO mild stroke target population is limited.\n\nThis study will test the hypothesis that patients presenting within 8 hours of onset with cerebral ischemia in the setting of proximal large vessel occlusions (LVO) and low baseline NIHSS scores (0-5) will have better 90-day clinical outcomes (mRS distribution) with immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) compared to initial medical management (iMM)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["Immediate Mechanical Thrombectomy","Initial medical management","Large vessel occlusion","Efficacy","Safety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Immediate mechanical thrombectomy(iMT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment initiation within 8 hours of symptom onset.
