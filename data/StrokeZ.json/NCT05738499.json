Studies have shown that interventions based on character strengths are widely used in chronic disease patients abroad, and have achieved the effect of improving the physical and mental health. However, research on individualized character strengths in stroke patient intervention is limited, and more clinical evidence is needed. This study is based on personality theory and the application of character strengths-based STEP programme (CSSTEP) in stroke patients. The investigators hypothesized that the CSSTEP programme could help stroke patients to improve mental state, cognitive function, and better gait performance, suffer from less post-stroke depression, enhance their post-stroke self-confidence.","detailedDescription":"Post-stroke patients are often accompanied by different degrees of cognitive and language impairments. About 45% of the patients have persistent limb dysfunction, which leads to strong psychological stress reactions in patients, and negative emotions such as anxiety and depression are common. There is an urgent need for educational and psychological adjustment to stimulate the patient's motivation to actively carry out rehabilitation, so as to reduce negative emotions, enhance the patient's intrinsic motivation for rehabilitation, and reduce the patient's disability. Studies have shown that interventions based on character strengths are widely used in chronic disease patients abroad, and have achieved the effect of improving the physical and mental health of patients. However, research on individualized character strengths in stroke patient intervention is limited, and more clinical evidence is needed. This study is based on personality theory and the application of character strengths-based STEP programme (CSSTEP) in stroke patients. The investigators hypothesized that the CSSTEP programme could help stroke patients to improve mental state, cognitive function, and better gait performance, suffer from less post-stroke depression, enhance their post-stroke self-confidence. In addition, the investigators will use the application of CSSTEP in stroke care to provide a theoretical basis for a new personality direction for clinical psychological intervention, and provide new ideas and ideas for improving the stroke rehabilitation system and establishing a new personalized post-stroke intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Intervention","Rehabilitation","Depression"],"keywords":["Stroke","Chronic illness management","Intervention","Post-stroke depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":172,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CSSTEP Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"On the basis of routine post-stroke care, the CSSTEP programme was added for a total of three weeks.
