Stroke patients were grouped in terms of diabetes status as determined by past medical history. Stroke diagnosis was confirmed with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical care, including the acute management ofstroke and hyperglycemia, was done at the discretion of the Neurology service not involved in the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hyperglycemia"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Stroke","Hyperglycemia","Procoagulation","Diabetes","Blood coagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diabetic subject","description":"Subjects with acute stroke, hyperglycemia and history of diabetes."},{"label":"Normoglycemic Control","description":"Subjects with acute stroke and normal blood glucose."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"FVIIa","description":"FVIIa levels were compared between the normoglycemic and hyperglycemic subjects.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TF-PCA","description":"TF-PCA levels compared between normoglycemic and hyperglycemic subjects.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients aged \\> 18 years presenting to the Emergency Department with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke will be included for study.\n* Acute stroke patients with normal blood glucose levels and patients with fingerstick blood glucose level of greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl will be eligible for study.\n* Acute Stroke will be defined as an acute disturbance of cerebral function of presumed vascular origin causing a neurological deficit of less than 24 hours duration.\n* Patients must have an NIH Stroke Scale Score of 4 to 23.
