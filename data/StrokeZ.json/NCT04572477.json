On the other hand, it is reported that cerebral ischemia may induce amyloid plaques and tau protein accumulation. However, it was difficult to in vivo disentangle the complex and dynamic interactions between AD pathophysiology and cerebral vascular injury in the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment in the past. With the advent of novel radiotracers specific to cerebral amyloid plaques and tau protein, we aim to conduct a prospective multimodal neuroimaging cohort study to investigate the contribution of vascular injury, amyloid plaques and tau protein to stroke recovery and post-stroke cognitive impairment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Dementia, Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Group A (acute stroke/TIA patients), n=200 Group B (chronic stroke/TIA patients), n=200 Group C (healthy elderly controls), n=30","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"[18F]THK-5351","type":"OTHER","description":"1.
