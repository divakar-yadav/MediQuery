Each evaluation lasts a total of two hours.\n\nPatients will be assessed in their rooms as follows:\n\n* Clinical evaluation of consciousness by the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R), a clinical scale considered as the \"gold-standard\". Duration 45 minutes (standard care in routine care)\n* 15-minute break between the two evaluations.\n* Paraclinical evaluation of consciousness by the brain-machine interface by measuring evoked potentials P300 auditory and vibrotactile and recording the EEG signal during a motor imaging task (imagine moving the right or left wrist). Duration 60 minutes.\n\nInstructions are given to the subject via headphones, in French. For the analysis of the evoked potentials, vibrotactile stimuli are delivered to the wrists and ankle of the subject. For auditory evoked potentials, auditory stimuli are delivered by headphones. The volume can be changed.\n\nThese assessments that we will perform with the brain-machine interface are similar to the assessments and stimulation of awakening and awareness sessions performed by speech-language pathologists in the departments concerned (presentation of visual and auditory stimuli). CRS-R is used in routine care to assess patients' level of consciousness. There is no recommendation on the type of additional examination to be performed (neuroimaging, EEG, evoked potentials) or on their frequency for the evaluation of patients' consciousness at a distance from their initial brain injury.\n\nEvaluation by the brain-machine interface in the room makes it possible to avoid transport to the complementary examination services (Medical Imaging Services, Neurological Functional Explorations) which cause fatigue (patient whose vigilance is fluctuating) which can make the complementary examination non-contributory. Patients are also not assessed at a date and time set by a complementary examination service and room assessment allows the patient to be assessed in the best conditions for him/her when he/she appears to be at his/her highest level of consciousness and rested (after consultation with the family and/or healthcare team).\n\nTotal duration of each session of a maximum of 2 hours, including the installation and uninstallation of the brain-machine interface.\n\nPatients receive their usual treatment and continue to participate in rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury With Prolonged Loss of Consciousness","Stroke","Brain Hypoxia"],"keywords":["Disorders of consciousness,","Brain Computer Interface","P300","Motor imagery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"brain injuried patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Clinical evaluation of consciousness by the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R),\n* 15-minute break between the two evaluations.\n* Paraclinical evaluation of consciousness by the brain-machine interface by measuring evoked potentials P300 auditory and vibrotactile and recording the EEG signal during a motor imaging task (imagine moving the right or left wrist).","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical evaluation of consciousness by the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical evaluation of consciousness by the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R)","description":"Paraclinical evaluation of consciousness by the brain-machine interface by measuring evoked potentials P300 auditory and vibrotactile and recording the EEG signal during a motor imaging task","armGroupLabels":["brain injuried patients"],"otherNames":["other"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"correlation between the response of patients obtained with the brain-machine interface (detection of auditory and vibrotactile P300 and modifications of EEG signal during a motor imagery task) and their clinical consciousness score","description":"correlation coefficient (units: -1;
