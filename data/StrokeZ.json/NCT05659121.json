Feasibilities, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, patient and therapist's view of the application of robotic exoskeleton will be evaluated.","detailedDescription":"In recent years, robot-assisted gait training has been increasingly applied in various rehabilitation facilities across Singapore. Thus far, all systems in Singapore are tethered to treadmills or other platforms. These are bulky, expensive, and the 'gait' trained differs from normal gait to varying degrees. Such systems are found only in hospitals and major centres with significant space and financial resources. No evaluation of cost-effectiveness has been performed thus far. With appropriate and efficient clinical protocols adapted and optimised for the Singapore context, study team plans to demonstrate engaging and cost-effective delivery of rehabilitation care, particularly in the community. The aims of the programme include:\n\n1. To study the feasibility of the robotic exoskeleton application in both hospital and community rehabilitation settings (inpatient and outpatient)\n2. To investigate if robotic exoskeletons training could improve motor outcomes in patients with impaired mobility, in the subacute and chronic phases of recovery.\n3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of robotic exoskeleton application in rehabilitation.\n\n400 participants with impaired walking ability will be recruited at a 3:1 ratio (intervention: control) from participating centres of the iMOVE programme (Improving Mobility Via Exoskeletons) in Singapore. The iMOVE Programme is a pilot clinical programme, funded by Temasek Foundation Cares, evaluating the utility of robotic exoskeletons for the rehabilitation of mobility across the continuum of rehabilitation care.\n\nThis will be a non-randomized controlled study. Eligible participants will be asked for their willingness to undergo robotic exoskeleton training (RET). Those who decline intervention will be offered participation in the control group, where they will receive their usual care with conventional physiotherapy.\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will receive 12 sessions of RET incorporated into their conventional physiotherapy session. Typical total duration of physiotherapy is 45-60 minutes, comprising 30 minutes of RET, and 15-30 minutes of conventional physiotherapy. The training period will follow participant's own physiotherapy schedule, the frequency of which might range from 5 times a week (for inpatient) to 1-2 times a week (for outpatient). Outcome measures including measurement for functional mobility and quality of life will be performed before training, after training and 6 months post-training.\n\nParticipants in the control group will only undergo outcome measures assessment. They will continue with their conventional physiotherapy and the frequency and type of activity at physiotherapy will be recorded. Outcome measures for the control group will be performed at similar time points as the intervention group, i.e., before training (i.e., after signing ICF), after training (after 12 sessions of conventional physiotherapy) and 6 months later.\n\nThe application of robotic exoskeleton in rehabilitation among patients with walking impairment will also be evaluated through qualitatively exploring the perceptions of patients and therapists. The factors influencing the utilization of the robotic exoskeletons for rehabilitation among patients will also be explored."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal Cord Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":375,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EksoGT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the intervention group will receive 12 sessions of robotic exoskeleton training incorporated into their conventional physiotherapy session.","interventionNames":["Device: robotic exoskeleton training"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants in the control group will only undergo outcome measures assessment.
