An a priori sample size of 117 individuals based on an alpha level of .05 and level of acceptable error at 3% was calculated. Anticipating for loss to follow up rate of up to 20%, a total of 142 participants will be recruited. Patients will be recruited among those who attend virtual medical appointments at Parkwood Institute for ABI and SCI. We will also liaise with SCI-Ontario and the Ontario Brain Injury Association to assist in the recruitment of additional participants. Those who consent will complete an online survey on enrollment into the study, and subsequently at 3 and 6 months. Demographic data of the individuals participating in the study will be recorded. Participants' access to health care services will be evaluated using the following subdomains: medical care, complementary care, medications/equipment, satisfaction/acceptability, affordability, ability to engage, and indirect support."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injuries","Stroke","Spinal Cord Injuries"],"keywords":["Stroke","Spinal Cord Injury","Brain Injury","COVID","Access to health care","Mental Health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":142,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SCI, brain injury, stroke Participants","description":"Those 18 years of age and older, diagnosed with a stroke, spinal cord injury (traumatic and non-traumatic), or acquired brain injury (of all severities, including concussion) living in the community will be included.
