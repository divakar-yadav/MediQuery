The current strategy for the hypertensive treatment of patients during the acute phase of ischemic stroke within the first 72 hours remains a highly debated and unclear issue, with no consensus on the range or appropriate blood pressure ranges to be handled (13).\n\nTeam study working hypothesis focuses on the study of blood pressure (for 72 hours), through its intensive control (recording and adjustment every four hours), in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Specifically, it is based on the monitoring and maintenance of systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg in patients with acute ischemic stroke; And this can lead to a better functional prognosis, measured at 90 days, compared with the functional prognosis of patients treated according to the recommendations of the current Clinical Guidelines, which propose to act on systolic blood pressure only when it exceeds 185 mm Hg (13,22).\n\nAlthough the intense decrease in blood pressure during the acute phase of stroke has the potential risk of decreasing cerebral perfusion in the area of ischemic penumbra, in recent observational studies (19), a worse functional prognosis has not been found in those patients With systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg.\n\nThere is no previous evidence from other intervention studies related to blood pressure control and a benefit to patients with acute ischemic stroke. Comparison using a randomized clinical trial of a group of patients with blood pressure control following current guidelines with a group of patients with systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg may allow a simple, rapidly applicable therapeutic alternative to Clinical practice, low cost and extrapolable to a wider population, such as patients with stroke of any etiology."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia"],"keywords":["Brain ischemia","Cerebral ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"National, multicenter, open, two-parallel groups, randomized 1: 1","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A: pressure ≥140 and ≤160mmHg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intensive management of blood pressure, maintaining a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 and ≤ 160 mm Hg for 72 hours.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Group A"]},{"label":"Group B: Keep systolic pressure <185mmHg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intensive management of blood pressure, maintaining systolic blood pressure \\<185 mm Hg for 72 hours.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Group B"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Group A","description":"Maintaining a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 and ≤ 160mm Hg for 72 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Group A: pressure ≥140 and ≤160mmHg"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Group B","description":"Maintaining a systolic blood pressure \\<185mm Hg for 72 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Group B: Keep systolic pressure <185mmHg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Study of functional prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke using modified Rankin","description":"Study of functional prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke using modified Rankin scale measured at 90 ± 15 days will compared between the two branches.Rankin Scale: It is a scale that evaluates the patient's functional situation.
