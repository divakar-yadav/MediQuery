ESD service was developed to facilitate patient to their daily livings at home, reduce the length of stay in the hospital with possibly better or equivalent outcomes for patients and caregivers.\n\nESD service has been proven to be non-inferior in the functional and quality of life measures as well as cost-effective, compared to the conventional rehabilitation service in many countries, however the effectiveness of ESD service may differ among countries and medical, economical circumstances. This study aims to examine the effect of ESD service on the acute stroke patients with mild to moderate disabilities in Korea and demonstrate its feasibility as an alternative medical service option to those patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Early Supported Discharge","Acute stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The trial consists of two arms; An Early Supported Discharge group and Conventional Rehabilitation group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessors are blinded to the patients' group","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early Supported Discharge (ESD) Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in the ESD group will be discharged to home as soon as the acute medical treatment is finished.
