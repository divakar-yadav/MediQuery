The height can be adjusted from 0 to 16.5 centimeters, the stair was 0.74 m in width, with each step being 16 cm deep and 10 cm long. The experimental group received different heights of lateral stair walking training according to the patients' ability. The patients went up the stairs with the affected leg up first and they went down stairs with the sound leg leading first. For safety, the subjects held a handrail during the lateral stair walking exercise. The control group received traditional physiotherapy (strengthening exercise, balance training and gait training) for 30 minutes. Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks. All the interventions were done by the same physical therapist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["lateral stair walking","range of motion","muscle strength"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"lateral stair walking exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group received 15 minutes of lateral stair walking exercise","interventionNames":["Device: lateral stair walking exercise","Device: traditional physiotherapy"]},{"label":"traditional physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"strengthening exercise, balance training and gait training","interventionNames":["Device: lateral stair walking exercise","Device: traditional physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"lateral stair walking exercise","description":"15 minutes of lateral stair walking exercise","armGroupLabels":["lateral stair walking exercise","traditional physiotherapy"],"otherNames":["stair walking training"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"traditional physiotherapy","description":"strengthening exercise, balance training and gait training","armGroupLabels":["lateral stair walking exercise","traditional physiotherapy"],"otherNames":["physical therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"muscle strength","description":"Mycroft 3 hand-held dynamometer18: It has good reliability.

Its advantage lies in the lack of ceiling effect and floor effect, and the static and dynamic balance of stroke patients can be assessed. It is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, (total score of = 36) The Higher scores indicate better balance in stroke patients.","timeFrame":"Both the experimental group and control group received the intervention once a week for 12 weeks.The measures were done by one experience physical therapist before receiving the intervention and at weeks four, eight, and twelve."},{"measure":"Fugal-Meyer assessment for Lower extremity,","description":"It is an assessment scale developed from Brunnstrom stage-L/E specifically dedicated to stroke patients.
