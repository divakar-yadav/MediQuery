In addition to traditional swallowing therapies for post-stroke dysphagia (PSD), the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) is used to provide tongue exercise program which improving swallowing function. Additionally, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is also beneficial to manage PSD. In rehabilitation unit, ultrasound is a convenient tool and is more widely used in investigating oropharyngeal muscles mass and quality in PSD. Therefore, the investigators hope to assess the effects on swallowing function and oropharyngeal muscle mass on sonography after IOPI swallowing training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation in PSD.\n\nFirst, the investigators will enroll 20 normal people, whose ages should be from 40-80 years old, to verify the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of sonography and use IOPI to assess maximal muscle strength and endurance of oropharyngeal muscles. Second, 40 stroke patients with different levels in dysphagia will be enrolled. Each patient will receive clinical assessments of swallowing and tongue functions, general and oropharyngeal muscles mass and quality by sonography, and life quality. These stroke patients with dysphagia will be randomly allocated in two groups. the investigators will provide two interventions including combined simple and IOPI therapies(n=20), and combined swallowing therapy with NMES(n=20) for the 2 groups.\n\nThe investigators will investigate the differences of swallowing and tongue functions, oropharyngeal muscles on sonography in patients with PSD. The effects of the swallowing therapies in swallowing function, oropharyngeal muscle mass, and life quality will be explored in PSD by using different swallowing therapies. The investigators will find out the most effective swallowing therapy from these 2 interventions for PSD. Furthermore, the investigators could explore that sonography is a clinically practical tool for assessing oropharyngeal muscles mass and quality in PSD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","dysphagia","sonography","tongue exercises","swallowing therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"combined swallowing and IOPI group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"the patients will receive swallowing therapy and IOPI biofeedback exercise program","interventionNames":["Other: swallowing therapy","Other: IOPI therapy"]},{"label":"combined swallowing and NMES group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"the patients will receive swallowing therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation","interventionNames":["Other: swallowing therapy","Other: neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) therapy"]},{"label":"Normal group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"20 normal people will receive sonography evaluations to verify the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of sonography, and use IOPI to assess maximal muscle strength and endurance of oropharyngeal muscles."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"swallowing therapy","description":"oral exercises, tongue movement, and compensatory techniques, swallowing maneuvers and food modifications, will be performed by an experienced speech and language therapist during intervention","armGroupLabels":["combined swallowing and IOPI group","combined swallowing and NMES group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"IOPI therapy","description":"tongue muscle strengthening and endurance exercises by using 15-min IOPI biofeedback program.
