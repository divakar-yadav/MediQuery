The NanoSense study will enroll up to 500 subjects in up to 10 centers in order to collect data which includes at least 150 heart failure hospitalizations in participating subjects.The duration of the NanoSense study is expected to be 2 years. The study device is the Wearable Congestive Heart Failure Management System (WCHFS, also known as SimpleSENSE)","detailedDescription":"NanoSense is a data collection study to develop a multi-sensor algorithm to predict worsening Heart Failure (HF). Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and agree to participate in the study will enter the informed consent process in which the subject will be informed about the research study, the voluntary nature of the research and all attendant risks and benefits. Once the subject has been informed and all question answered, the subject will be asked to sign an informed consent document (approved by the local Institutional Review Board). At enrollment, data about subject demographics, cardiac disease history, and comorbidities will be collected. The subject vital signs, blood labs (as available; if an N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is not available, one will be ordered to coincide with the next lab samples), HF medications and HF assessment measurements will be made and recorded. Subjects will be given a diary to record daily weights, diuretics changes, and weekly HF status. The subject will be fitted with a Nanowear Wearable Congestive Heart Failure System (WCHFS) and educated on the use of the system with attention to proper fit and changing or charging the battery daily depending on the type of battery used. Subjects who have a pacemaker or Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) will undergo pacemaker/ICD interrogation while wearing the device to assure that there are no electrical signals detected that may interfere with pacemaker or ICD function.\n\nThe subjects will be asked to wear the device for approximately 12 hours daily including 2 hours prior to sleep and 2 hours after awakening. The follow-up period will be 90 days. At visit 2, the clinical assessment will be repeated and recorded. The device will be retrieved from the subject. In the event that a subject is unable to travel to the investigator's site, the subject will be asked to mail the device back to the sponsor with use of a prepaid mailing package that will be delivered to the subject. Data may be obtained by phone if the subject is unable or unwilling to return for visit 2.\n\nA final contact will be made to the subject at 30 days following visit 2 to determine whether there were any adverse effects that were not previously recognized that may be related to their participation in the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure"],"keywords":["Fluid decompensation","Non-invasive Multi-parameter monitoring","Multi-parameter algorithm","Heart Rate Variability","Thoracic impedance","Heart Sounds","Respiration","Posture","Activity","Tidal Volume","Stroke Volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Heart Failure Patients","description":"Patients with primary diagnosis as heart failure","interventionNames":["Device: SimpleSENSE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SimpleSENSE","description":"The Nanosense study is observational only.
