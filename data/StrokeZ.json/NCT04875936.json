Using a novel brain imaging technique, called real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback combined with right hand motor imagery, this project will re-instate brain activity in the left language-dominant hemisphere. Stroke patients will practice modulating their own brain activity using fMRI neurofeedback signal and will select the most effective mental strategies that help them maintain brain activation patterns associated with better reading recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dyslexia, Acquired"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants are randomly assigned to one of 2 groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will be masked to the nature of real-time fMRI neurofeedback they will receive: contingent or non-contingent.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Motor Imagery and Contingent Neurofeedback (NFB)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive real-time fMRI NFB on the bases of participant's own brain activity","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motor Imagery and Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback"]},{"label":"Motor Imagery and Non-contingent Neurofeedback (NFB)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive group will receive fMRI NFB based on another participant's brain activity","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motor Imagery and Sham fMRI Neurofeedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motor Imagery and Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback","description":"Survivors of left-hemisphere stroke (\\<10 weeks post-stroke) or healthy volunteers will use right-hand motor imagery coupled with fMRI neurofeedback to help them re-engage the left hemisphere by shifting brain activation leftward relative to the initial left-right asymmetry.
