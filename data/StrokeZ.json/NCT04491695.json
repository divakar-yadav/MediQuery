However, immediate, potent and reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation is not possible. Additionally, more than 5% patients have aspirin resistance and more than 15% patients have clopidogrel resistance. Therefore, an intravenously administered GPIIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (Tirofiban) receptor blocker with fast onset and offset of actions will provide more desired antiplatelet effects in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, especially in patients with high risk of neurological deterioration. This study will measure the anti-platelet effects of Tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke who had high risk of neurological deterioration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Neurological deterioration","Stroke progression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":420,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tirofiban+Oral antiplatelet therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive Tirofiban in the first 72 hours and bridge to oral antiplatelet therapy thereafter.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tirofiban Hydrochloride","Drug: Oral antiplatelet"]},{"label":"Oral antiplatelet therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive oral antiplatelet therapy alone.","interventionNames":["Drug: Oral antiplatelet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tirofiban Hydrochloride","description":"Tirofiban will use a loading dose, 0.4 μg/kg/min × 30 minutes, then 0.1μg/kg/min infusion for 71.5 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Tirofiban+Oral antiplatelet therapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Oral antiplatelet","description":"Aspirin, clopidogrel or other antiplatelet drugs.
