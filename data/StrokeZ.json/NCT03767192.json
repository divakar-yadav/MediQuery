Later, it was decided to define the first part (before the halt) as a separate study - ImpACT-24A, and identify the continuation of the study as ImpACT-24B. ImpACT-24B continues to be registered as NCT00826059, and ImpACT-24A is registered in this new record.\n\nDetailed Description:\n\nA multi-center, multinational, randomized, double blind, sham control, adjunctive to Standard of Care, parallel arm study with ongoing DSMB review of accumulated safety data.\n\nScreening:\n\nTreatment should be initiated between 8 and 24 hours from stroke onset. All screened patients will be identified by patient number and will sign the informed consent prior to any study procedure initiation.\n\nPeriod 1: Day 1-5\n\nDay 1- Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 (ISS Stimulation: Sham Control) ratio:\n\nGroup 1: Implantation and ISS Stimulation during five consecutive days \\& Standard of Care Group 2: Implantation and Sham Stimulation during five consecutive days \\& Standard of Care The implantation will be performed by a trained physician. Stimulation/sham stimulation will be delivered Day 2-5 ISS / Sham Stimulation will be repeated during the following four consecutive days by trained personnel within 18-26 hours from preceding stimulation.\n\nDay 5 / Day of Discharge. Following the last ISS /Sham Stimulation, explantation will be performed.\n\nSubjects will continue with Standard of Care as needed and will be released from the hospital upon investigator's judgment.\n\nPeriod 2: Day of Discharge - 90±7 days During this period both groups (ISS Stimulation and Sham Control) will be treated according to Standard of Care either at the hospital, rehabilitation center or at home.\n\nScheduled visits will be performed on day 30±7 and day 60 ±7, which will include safety and effectiveness assessments.\n\nFinal Visit Day 90±7 days: The final visit will be performed at the study site and will include safety and effectiveness evaluations.\n\nPatients will be contacted by study personnel via telephone on Day 180±7 and on Day 360±7 in order to assess their quality of life status."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","randomized clinical trial","effectiveness","safety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":327,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Device: The Ischemic Stroke System SPG stimulation and standard of care","interventionNames":["Device: Active Stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Device: Sham control Sham stimulation and standard of care","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active Stimulation","description":"SPG stimulation and standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Active Stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham Stimulation","description":"Sham SPG stimulation and standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Sham Stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sliding Dichotomy modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months","description":"Final global disability level on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months better than expectation (sliding dichotomy analysis) ) assessed in the modified intention to treat (mITT) population defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least the minimal exposure of 1 treatment (ISS Stimulation or Sham Control) session out of the 5 planned sessions.\n\nmRS Scale:\n\n* 0 - No symptoms.\n* 1 - No significant disability.
