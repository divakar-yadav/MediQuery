The study will recruit 100 stroke patients with hemisphere lesions (50 patients for right and left each) and 100 age-matched healthy controls. The participants will conduct a simple reaction time task in VR, with stimuli designated in the left or right hemi-field. The stroke patients will also received traditional tests for hemi-neglect. Test-retest reliability of the assessment will be conducted in a subset of the control group. The stroke patients will be followed in 3-4 weeks.","detailedDescription":"The researchers designed a software based on a head-mounted displays for virtual reality (HMD-VR) to evaluate the reaction time to stimuli presented at right or left visual field.

The researchers will also collect the demographic data, cognition function and daily activity function. Test-retest reliability of the assessment will be conducted in a subset of the control group. The stroke patients will be followed in 3-4 weeks. The researchers will compare the results of a traditional hemi-neglect tests and VR-based tests and their changes in two occasions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae","Neglect, Hemispatial"],"keywords":["attention","hemineglect","virtual reality","reaction time"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke (right)","description":"stroke patient with lesions at right hemisphere"},{"label":"stroke (left)","description":"stroke patient with lesions at left hemisphere"},{"label":"control","description":"age-matched group for the stroke patients"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"reaction time","description":"reaction time to the stimuli presented in the right or left hemi-field with VR software","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"hemineglect tests","description":"Paper-based behavior inattention test (BIT)","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ADL","description":"activities of daily living function evaluated by barthel index","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"cognition","description":"using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"cybersickness","description":"using Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria for stroke patients:\n\n1. aged at least 20 years old\n2. diagnosed with stroke involving unilateral MCA and ACA territory\n3. with unilateral upper limb with normal function\n4. neurologically and medically stable.\n\nInclusion criteria for control group:\n\n1) healthy adults, age-matched to stroke patients\n\nExclusion Criteria for both groups:\n\n1. with history of neurological or psychiatric conditions other than stroke;\n2. significant cognitive or speech problems that cause difficulties to cooperate with testing;\n3. significant visual problems (such as color blindness, visual loss, cataract, glaucoma or other major eye condition)\n4. upper limb musculoskeletal disorders to cause difficulties to use the keyboard or controller;\n5. history of seizure, vestibular dysfunction or vertigo\n6. can't tolerate HMD-VR","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation unit in a medical center","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Huey-Wen Liang, MD","affiliation":"National Taiwan University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"National Taiwan University Hospital","city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010468","term":"Perceptual Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13069","name":"Perceptual Disorders","asFound":"Neglect, Hemispatial","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
