Concerning the decision to prescribe (take) treatment on the basis of a decision aid, are there necessary both diagrams (that with risk without treatment, and that with risk under treatment), or it is enough only the second (risk under treatment, which normally gives all the needed information)?\n2. Concerning the decision to prescribe (take) treatment, is it a difference between the effects of the presentation on decision aid of the risk of stroke for the next 1 year, and the presentation of the estimated risk of stroke for the next 5 years?\n3. Is the decision different if physicians prescribe the anticoagulant treatment to patients, over if they should take it themselves?\n\nStudy: 2x3 factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) for comparison:\n\n1. Between the decision aid with 2 images (without treatment + with treatment) and the one with 1 image (risk only with treatment)\n2. Between the effect of the presentation of the stroke risk chart for 1 year and the stroke risk chart for 5 years.\n3. The decision to prescribe to patients over the decision to take the treatment themselves.\n\nThe comparison will be made for the spectrum of risks (scores CHA2DS2-VASC) from 1-5.\n\nSample size: was calculated a sample of 948 participants (474 + 474) for p = 0.05, power = 80% statistical difference between decisions of 5% (from 95% to 90%). The study does not have enough power neither to compare the 5 groups CHA2DS2-VASC (but we will make these comparisons with exploratory purpose), nor to test interactions.\n\nParticipants: physicians participating to the National Congress of Internal Medicine, physicians participating to courses, professional manifestations.\n\nRandomization: randomization will be done on graph type (1 or 2 pictures), duration of risk estimate (1 year and 5 years) and the size of CHA2DS2-VASC risk score (1 to 5), and target prescription (patient or the doctor himself), a total of 40 possibilities. Randomization will be done in blocks of 40.\n\nParticipants will be asked to decide, depending on the risk chart, if the patient (or himself) will be treated, ignoring the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe chart will contain the pictogram according to the CHA2DS2-VASC risk score, without communicating the actual score, and the physician will have to make the decision to treat or not, depending on the perceived risk, and not on treatment guidelines.\n\nNo. questionnaire: first digit = number of risk diagrams (1 or 2); second digit = number of years for which the risk of stroke is calculated (1 or 5); third digit = CHA2DS2-VASC score (1-5). Ex: 253: 2 decision aid diagrams (with and without treatment), with an estimated risk of stroke for the next five years, in a patient with CHA2DS2-VASC score =3.\n\nEffect (outcome): decision to treat / not to treat the patient / physician himself, with oral anticoagulants.\n\nStatistical analysis: It will look for differences in bivariate analysis, and multivariate = logistic regression (dependent variable = treatment decision, the independent variables = number of charts, period for risk assessment (one or 5 years), prescription target (patient or the physician himself), CHA2DS2-VASC score, time from graduation, medical/teaching grade, working in hospital / ambulatory, the size of the city the physician works in, specialty, gender, age, if the physician has/had someone close with stroke (data from questionnaires)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["shared decision making","oral anticoagulant","atrial fibrillation","stroke","decision to treat"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":968,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"risk presented on 1 diagram","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"decision aid with risk of stroke presented on 1 diagram (risk under OAC treatment)","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"risk presented on 2 diagrams","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"decision aid with risk of stroke presented on 2 diagrams (one presenting risk without and one presenting risk with treatment)","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"1year risk estimate","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"risk of stroke presented over a timeframe of 1 year","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"5year risk estimate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"risk of stroke presented over a timeframe of 5 years","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 1","type":"OTHER","description":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score =1","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 2","type":"OTHER","description":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score =2","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 3","type":"OTHER","description":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score =3","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 4","type":"OTHER","description":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score =4","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 5","type":"OTHER","description":"CHA2DS2-VASC risk score =5","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"prescription to virtual patient","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"prescription is done for a virtual patient","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]},{"label":"prescription to physician himself","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"prescription is done to physician himself","interventionNames":["Other: decision aid"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"decision aid","description":"decision aid with one/two diagrams decision aid with risk over one/five years decision aid with CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 1 to 5 target of the prescription: patient / physician hinself","armGroupLabels":["1year risk estimate","5year risk estimate","CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 1","CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 2","CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 3","CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 4","CHA2DS2-VASC risk score 5","prescription to physician himself","prescription to virtual patient","risk presented on 1 diagram","risk presented on 2 diagrams"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Prescribed Oral Anticoagulants (OAC) According to the Number of Decision Aid Diagrams","description":"after regarding the risk diagram, the physician will decide to prescribe/take or not the treatment","timeFrame":"after seeing the decision aid (5 min)"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Prescribed Oral Anticoagulants (OAC) According to the Timeframe for Risk Presentation (1 vs 5 Years)","description":"the proportion of physicians deciding to prescribe OAC after seeing risk estimation on 1 vs 5 years","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Prescribed Oral Anticoagulants (OAC) According to the Target of Prescription (Patient vs. Physician Himself)","description":"the participant physicians were randomized to prescribe to virtual patients or to imagine that the risk seen in the diagram was that of themselves","timeFrame":"5 min"},{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Prescribed Oral Anticoagulants (OAC) According to the CHA2D2s-VASC Risk Score","description":"The proportion of OAC prescription for the range 1-5 of CHA2D2s-VASC scores.
