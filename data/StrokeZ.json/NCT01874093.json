Otherwise, implement retirements and continue only after DSMB approval.\n\nDSMB meetings: after 10 implantations\n\nPhase II - Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage Assessment (sICH):\n\n* Number of patients: 50 (additional 30)\n* Implanters: all certified implanters\n* Verify no clinically meaningful difference between treated and control. A clinically meaningful difference is a difference of more than 3 sICH cases within the first 5 days of treatment, in the treated arm compared to the control arm.\n\nIn case of clinically meaningful difference, implement retirements.\n\n* Continue to phase III after DSMB approval.\n* DSMB meetings: after 30 and 50 patients\n\nPhase III - Entire study population, DSMB meetings at 100 and 150 patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"INS implantation, 5 Days of Ischemic Stroke System (ISS) Stimulation + Standard of Care","interventionNames":["Device: The Ischemic Stroke System"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham implantation, 5 Days of Sham Stimulation + Standard of Care","interventionNames":["Device: Sham control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"The Ischemic Stroke System","description":"SPG stimulation and standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Active Stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham control","description":"Sham stimulation and standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Sham Stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Distribution of patients across the ordinal modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"The primary effectiveness endpoint will be the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) evaluated by the site on Day 90±7.\n\nThe statistical analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint will be: Sliding Dichotomous mRS.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Distribution of patients with NIHSS best language score ≥ 2 at screening across the ordinal modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"The secondary effectiveness endpoint will be the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) evaluated by the site on Day 90±7 for patients with NIHSS best language score ≥ 2 at screening.\n\nThe statistical analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint will be: Sliding Dichotomous mRS.","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
