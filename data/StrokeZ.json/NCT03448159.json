Both groups will receive an exercise program in addition to standard of care rehabilitation, but only one group (the intervention group) will receive the active drug fluoxetine.\n\nStudy participants will be evaluated at baseline, post-exercise program and 6-months post-exercise program. While enrolled in the study, participants will be required to take part in a 12 week, 3 times per week exercise program. Evaluators and patients will be blind to the treatment administered. The trial is constructed with randomization to remove selection and allocation biases and to ensure greater validity in observed differences in the outcome measures. The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) in Toronto will act as the coordinating and analysis center."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases"],"keywords":["Stroke","Exercise","Fluoxetine","Randomized Control Trial","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Arm 1: Intervention group (will receive the trial drug, fluoxetine, as well as an exercise intervention) Arm 2: Placebo group (will receive a placebo as well as an exercise intervention","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fluoxetine Hydrochloride","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fluoxetine (Prozac) will be administered to this group.
