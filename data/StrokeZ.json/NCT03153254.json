The use of robot assisted therapy (RAT) might partly solve this problem. Rehabilitation progress highly depends on training intensity and training duration, favouring the use of RAT.\n\nIn this pilot study, the usability of a new upper arm RAT device for upper arm rehabilitation in stroke patients is investigated. Myo-electrical signals will serve as input for the device, assisting the user in flexion and extension of the elbow, which is combined with a stabilizing shoulder brace and a bionic glove."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper extremity","Rehabilitation","Robot assisted therapy","Robotics","Devices","Orthosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Phase 1: Healthy persons Phase 2: Stroke patients","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy persons","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Test upper limb robot assisted therapy device.
