This will be accomplished by the collection of all available admission imaging data along with patient clinical and functional outcome results at 90-day follow-up to determine if a positive association exists between these variables. A secondary aim is to collect and summarize the 90-day functional outcome data for the purpose of sample size estimation for a potential randomized concurrent controlled trial. This will be accomplished by collecting the data on 90-day modified Rankin Scores (mRS) and all cause mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Penumbra System","Mechanical Thrombectomy","Ischemic Stroke","Intervention","Neurovascular","Thrombus","Imaging","Ischemic Penumbra","Functional Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":289,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Penumbra System","description":"Mechanical Thrombectomy in acute stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with an imaging-defined ischemic penumbra at admission that warrants revascularization by the Penumbra System.","timeFrame":"Admission"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with successful revascularization of the occluded target vessel as defined by a TIMI score of 2 or 3 following use of the Penumbra System.","timeFrame":"Post-Procedure"},{"measure":"The proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Score (mRS) of ≤2 at 90 days post-procedure.","timeFrame":"90-Days Post-Procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological status as defined by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at Admission and Discharge.","timeFrame":"Admission and Discharge"},{"measure":"Incidence of intracranial hemorrhage.","timeFrame":"24-Hours Post-Procedure"},{"measure":"Incidence of device-related serious adverse events.","timeFrame":"During the Procedure"},{"measure":"All cause mortality at 90 days post-procedure.","timeFrame":"90-Days Post-Procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients who signed informed consent and revascularized by the Penumbra™ System in accordance to the Instruction For Use are eligible for this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"A stroke cohort who were revacularized by the Penumbra System","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Siu Po Sit, PhD","affiliation":"Penumbra Inc.","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Swedish Medical Center","city":"Englewood","state":"Colorado","zip":"80113","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.64777,"lon":-104.98776}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Penumbra Website","url":"http://www.penumbrainc.com"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16376","name":"Thrombosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
