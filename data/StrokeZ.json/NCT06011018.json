It measures muscle strength, movement control, coordination, and balance. Scores range from 0 (no movement) to 34 (full recovery). Higher scores indicate better recovery.","timeFrame":"10minutes"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified ashworth scale","description":"The Modified Ashworth Scale assesses muscle spasticity in conditions like stroke or cerebral palsy. Scores range from 0 to 4 or 5, indicating the severity of muscle resistance during passive movement. Higher scores mean more severe spasticity. It guides treatment and tracks progress.","timeFrame":"5minutes"},{"measure":"Timed up and go test","description":"The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test assesses mobility by measuring the time it takes for someone to stand, walk a short distance, turn, and sit back down. Faster times suggest better mobility, while longer times may indicate mobility limitations or fall risk. It's a useful tool to evaluate functional capacity and guide interventions for improved mobility.","timeFrame":"5minutes"},{"measure":"The postural assessment scale for stroke patients","description":"Higher scores on the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) indicate greater difficulty in postural control and stability after a stroke.","timeFrame":"10 minutes"},{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"The Barthel Index assesses a person's ability to independently perform daily activities.
