Enrollment of patients will be done by using purposive sampling technique. The selection of the patients will be done on the basis of exclusion criteria and inclusion criteria. The patients enrolled will be divided into 2 groups. Group A patients will be given faradic current on the other hand group B patients will be provided with ankle foot orthosis. The assessment of the patient will be done after 6 months and the outcome tools used will be 10-meter walk test, stroke impact scale, 6-meter walk test, Berg balance scale, Time up and go test. The data of the patient will be noted before giving treatment and after treatment and will be compared after 6 months. Consent will be taken from each patient. Statistical Package of Social Sciences Version 20 will be used for the entry and analysis of data"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Foot Drop"],"keywords":["Stroke","Faradic Current","Ankle-Foot Orthosis","Foot Drop","Randomized Control Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Faradic current","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This study will use the faradic current for treating foot drop.
