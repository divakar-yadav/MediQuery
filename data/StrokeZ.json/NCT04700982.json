The functional output, the level of spasticity, and the level of motor development at admission and discharge will be determined using the Functional Independence Measure instrument, the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the Brunnstrom test, respectively. Based on the length of hospital stay, patients will be divided into two groups: hospital stays ≤ 3 months (Group 1) and \\> 3 months (Group 2). Clinical features and functional output will be compared between the groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Neurological Rehabilitation","Stroke","Rehabilitation Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":97,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Based on the length of hospital stay","description":"Based on the length of hospital stay, patients were divided into two groups: hospital stays ≤ 3 months (Group 1) and \\> 3 months (Group 2).","interventionNames":["Other: Based on the length of hospital stay"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Based on the length of hospital stay","description":"Based on the length of hospital stay, patients were divided into two groups: hospital stays ≤ 3 months (Group 1) and \\> 3 months (Group 2).Clinical features and functional output will be then compared between the groups.","armGroupLabels":["Based on the length of hospital stay"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical features and Functional Independence Measure instrument, the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the Brunnstrom test outcomes will be then compared between the groups.","description":"Demographic features, clinical features and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) instrument, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and the Brunnstrom test outcomes will be documented for all patients. The FIM includes 18 items with higher scores indicating greater independence. The motor development of the upper extremity, hand, and lower extremity will be evaluated using the Brunnstrom test with higher stages indicating greater development. The degree of spasticity of the upper and lower extremity muscles will be assessed using the MAS with high stage indicating greater spasticity.\n\nAll patients will be divided into two groups based on length of hospital stay. Clinical features, demographic features and FIM, MAS, and the Brunnstrom test outcomes will be then compared between the groups. All data for normality were tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
