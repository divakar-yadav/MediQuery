This study seeks to provide the preliminary data needed to plan a future study that will evaluate the efficacy of using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat stroke patients who have sleep apnea. Our goal is to use this therapy to reduce stroke symptom severity.","detailedDescription":"BACKGROUND Sleep apnea occurs in 60-96% of stroke survivors and is associated with poor functional recovery and higher post-stroke mortality. Among patients without stroke, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a safe and effective treatment for sleep apnea. This feasibility pilot study is a step in planning a future efficacy trial of CPAP for patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\nOBJECTIVES The primary objectives are, among acute ischemic stroke patients, to: (1) determine the feasibility of performing polysomnography; (2) refine the process for providing CPAP within 48-hours of stroke onset; and (3) determine the effect of CPAP on blood pressure.\n\nMETHODS This randomized controlled feasibility study will enroll 100 acute ischemic stroke patients. Intervention patients (N=60) receive CPAP within 48 hours of stroke onset and continuing for up to 30 days. At 30 days post-enrollment, the intervention patients undergo unattended polysomnography. Control (N=40) patients receive unattended polysomnography at baseline and after 30 days.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE CPAP represents an important new potential therapy for acute stroke. CPAP may reduce both the neurological symptom severity of the acute stroke and prevent stroke recurrence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Sleep Apnea"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","sleep apnea","continuous positive airway pressure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"continuous positive airway pressure","description":"Continuous Positive Airway Pressure initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset and continued for 90 days."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"proportion using CPAP within 48-hours of stroke onset","timeFrame":"72 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"prevalence of sleep apnea","timeFrame":"30 days post stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria: acute ischemic stroke with NIH Stroke Scale \\>=2 -\n\nExclusion Criteria: respiratory distress; COPD requiring oxygen; primary intracranial hemorrhage on admission brain imaging; time from symptom onset to sleep study or CPAP treatment \\>72 hours or time from hospital admission to sleep study or CPAP treatment \\>48 hours; life expectancy less than 6 months; inability to provide informed consent; inability to communicate in English; residence outside the greater New Haven area; or any condition where the monitoring required by the study would constitute a risk to the patient or impair his or her care.\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Dawn M Bravata, MD","affiliation":"Yale School of Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Yale-New Haven Hospital","city":"New Haven","state":"Connecticut","zip":"06520","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.30815,"lon":-72.92816}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21886365","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Bravata DM, Concato J, Fried T, Ranjbar N, Sadarangani T, McClain V, Struve F, Zygmunt L, Knight HJ, Lo A, Richerson GB, Gorman M, Williams LS, Brass LM, Agostini J, Mohsenin V, Roux F, Yaggi HK.
