Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.\n\nOnline programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.\n\nIf the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression","Stress, Psychological","Self Efficacy","Loneliness","Social Isolation","Health Care Utilization","Dementia","Dementia Alzheimers","Dementia of Alzheimer Type","Dementia, Vascular","Dementia Frontal","Dementia, Lewy Body","Dementia, Mixed","Dementia in Parkinsons Disease","Dementia, HIV","Dementia Frontotemporal","Dementia, Multi-Infarct"],"keywords":["Caregiver","Caregiving"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":418,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Building Better Caregivers Workshop Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Building Better Caregivers Workshop is a 6-week online self-management and skills building workshop.
