One of the main issues of their prescription is stoke prevention. With the coming of direct oral anticoagulants, which does not require repeating controls like it is the case for anti-vitamin K treatments, the patient's involvement is a guarantee of therapeutic adherence and good use. Nevertheless a good adherence level is seldom reached. This highlights the importance of individualized information which must be followed for purposes of accuracy and deepening. Thus as part of investigator's activity department that treats about 1000 patients per year for an Atrial Fibrillation, the information, use and therapeutic adherence are a priority in the care pathway of patients under direct oral anticoagulants. The investigators propose to measure the contribution of a specialized nurse consultation in contact with a multidisciplinary team on therapeutic adherence. The investigators hypothesis that an individualized and reassessed information would allowed a better understanding by the patients of their pathology and care and thus a better therapeutic adherence. A control group will present the same care pathway than all the patients of the service suffering from Atrial Fibrillation without specialized nurse consultation. The second group will benefit of a specialized nurse consultation throughout of which an individualized information will be delivered. This information will be reevaluated during the usual patient follow-up. All the patients will be followed at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year as part of the usual care of the service."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Anti-vitamin K","Direct anti-coagulant","Nurse"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"It is an open, prospective, randomized, 2 arms study that will compare 2 groups of patients care for Atrial Fibrillation in the Cardiology-Electrophysiology and Cardiac Stimulation Department with direct oral anticoagulants prescription.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":221,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1 : specialized nurse consultation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will benefit of a specialized nurse consultation throughout of which an individualized information will be delivered.
