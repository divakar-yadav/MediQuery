Participants will undergo a surgical procedure to implant a system that provides epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the cervical spinal cord. After surgery, Participants will undergo a structured physical rehabilitation program and electrical stimulation. Researchers will quantify the motor potentials in the arm and hand muscles generated by EES of the cervical spinal cord, tune optimal stimulation parameters to induced arm and hand movement, and assess participant motor function of the upper limb with standard clinical tests and simple motor tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Epidural electrical stimulation (EES)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will be implanted with 16-electrode epidural array in the C6-T1 area of the spinal cord.
