This study will also investigate whether treatments and events occurring in ICU contribute to this risk.","detailedDescription":"Undertake a retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to intensive care units between 2006 and 2023.\n\nStudy Participants: Adult patients admitted to a general adult intensive care unit at one or more of the study sites between 2006 and 1st of August 2023.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo determine the short and long-term cardiovascular consequences of critical illness and identify in-ICU factors that affect them.\n\nTo identify the risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter occurring during critical illness.\n\nTo study the association between poor cardiovascular function during critical illness and long-term cardiovascular disease.\n\nThis study will provide new knowledge about the associations between baseline cardiovascular risk, the disease resulting in ICU admission and therapies / events on ICU with subsequent major adverse cardiac events (MACE), to allow the ongoing risk of these events to be determined. If clinicans can idetnify who is at risk, then risk factors can potentially be modified ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Critical Illness","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Atrium; Fibrillation","Atrial Flutter"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ICU","description":"Patients treated on a general adult intensive care unit","interventionNames":["Other: Admission to ICU"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Admission to ICU","description":"Exposure is admission to an Intensive Care Unit","armGroupLabels":["ICU"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Major adverse cardiovascular and vascular events","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Arrhythmia","timeFrame":"5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hospital re-admission","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 16 years or above.\n* Admitted to an intensive care unit at a study site from 2006 onwards\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients that have informed their participating site that they do not wish their electronic records would be used for future research\n* Patients who inform us directly that they don't wish their records used in this research study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult patients admitted to a general adult intensive care unit at one or more of the study sites between 2006 and 1st of August 2023.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Robert Hatch","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+44 (0) 1865 231456","email":"robert.hatch@ndcn.ox.ac.uk"},{"name":"Jonathan Bedford","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+44 (0) 1865 231456","email":"jonathan.bedford@ndcn.ox.ac.uk"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Peter Watkinson","affiliation":"University of Oxford","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Reading","state":"Berkshire","zip":"RG1 5AN","country":"United Kingdom","contacts":[{"name":"Ian Rechner","role":"CONTACT"},{"name":"Ian Rechner","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.45625,"lon":-0.97113}},{"facility":"Oxford University Hospitals","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Oxford","state":"Oxfordshire","zip":"OX3 9DU","country":"United Kingdom","contacts":[{"name":"Peter Watkinson","role":"CONTACT","email":"peter.watkinson@ndcn.ox.ac.uk"},{"name":"Peter Watkinson","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.75222,"lon":-1.25596}},{"facility":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust","status":"SUSPENDED","city":"London","zip":"W12 0HS","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.50853,"lon":-0.12574}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Study website","url":"https://www.c3study.org/"},{"label":"Critical Care Research Group main website","url":"https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/critical-care-research-group-kadoorie-centre"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"Individual participant data will not be made publically available due to privacy and legal implications.
