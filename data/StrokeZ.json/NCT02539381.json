An unidentified visual defect can cause significant problems for recovery and quality of life. The Stroke Vision app (an application currently scaled for a 10\" Android tablet) has been developed to act as a screening tool for visual problems in stroke survivors; to help identify visual problems earlier and thereby improve rehabilitation outcomes. The app includes a suite of tests for assessing the patient's acuity, their visual fields and to aid in the identification of visual neglect / inattention. Furthermore, it includes educational information on visual stroke in order to better educate staff, patients and their carers. This study seeks to validate the novel digital assessments included in the Stroke Vision app against the current methods used for screening (clinical examination by confrontation field testing). Both screening measures will be compared with the gold standard methods for visual assessments, Octopus perimetry for fields and paper-based methods for visuospatial neglect"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Eye Abnormalities","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gold Standard Assessments","type":"OTHER","description":"* Formal perimetry (Goldman or Octopus visual field)\n* Albert's visual inattention test\n* Star cancellation visual inattention test\n* line bisection test\n* These are performed as part of the routine assessment in the visual stroke orthoptic clinic and neuro-ophthalmology clinics.\n* The time to perform the assessments or if the participant is unable to complete the assessment will be recorded.\n* Researcher will record a score (0-10) to quantify the participant's compliance","interventionNames":["Procedure: Formal Perimetry (Goldman or Octopus visual Field)","Procedure: Albert's visual inattention test","Procedure: Star cancellation visual inattention test"]},{"label":"Usual Clinical Screening Practice","type":"OTHER","description":"* Visual field assessment to confrontation\n* Visual inattention assessment to bilateral stimuli\n* The time to perform the assessments or if the participant is unable to complete the assessment will be recorded.\n* Researcher will record a score (0-10) to quantify the participant's compliance","interventionNames":["Procedure: Visual field assessment to confrontation","Procedure: Visual inattention assessment to bilateral stimuli"]},{"label":"Stroke Vision App","type":"OTHER","description":"* Digital tumbling E visual accuity assessment\n* Digital visual field assessment\n* Digital line crossing assessment\n* Digital shape cancellation assessment\n* The time to perform the assessments or if the participant is unable to complete the assessment will be recorded.\n* Researcher will record a score (0-10) to quantify the participant's compliance","interventionNames":["Device: Digital tumbling E visual accuity assessment","Device: Digital visual field assessment","Device: Digital line crossing assessment","Device: Digital shape cancellation assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Formal Perimetry (Goldman or Octopus visual Field)","armGroupLabels":["Gold Standard Assessments"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Albert's visual inattention test","armGroupLabels":["Gold Standard Assessments"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Star cancellation visual inattention test","armGroupLabels":["Gold Standard Assessments"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Visual field assessment to confrontation","armGroupLabels":["Usual Clinical Screening Practice"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Visual inattention assessment to bilateral stimuli","armGroupLabels":["Usual Clinical Screening Practice"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Digital tumbling E visual accuity assessment","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Vision App"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Digital visual field assessment","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Vision App"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Digital line crossing assessment","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Vision App"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Digital shape cancellation assessment","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Vision App"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of Stroke Vision Tablet App to support assessment of visual field defects when compared with visual field assessment to confrontation in standard clinical practice","description":"Visual field will be captured either by the Stroke Vision App or by confrontation.
