Stroke cases were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry and the diagnoses were individually verified. Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to estimate the association between fatty acids and stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Subcutaneous adipose tissue"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57053,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Fatty acids present in adipose tissue samples"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke, including validated subtypes","timeFrame":"From baseline until 30 November 2009"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria: Born in Denmark, aged 50-64 years, residing in the urban and suburban areas of Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n-\n\nExclusion Criteria: Pre-existing cancer diagnosis.
