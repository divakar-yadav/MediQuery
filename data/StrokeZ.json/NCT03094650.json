The investigators hypothesize that intensive VR-based rehabilitation may lead to high rehabilitation doses and functional improvement in chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke","Motor Disorders"],"keywords":["stroke","neurorehabilitation","virtual reality","rehabilitation dose","motor rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MindMotion PRO","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The training sessions consist of virtual reality based rehabilitation exercises using the MindMotion PRO device.","interventionNames":["Device: MindMotion PRO"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MindMotion PRO","description":"Patients will receive five weeks of therapy with 2 sessions (minimum) per week lasting for 45-60 minutes each minimum.
