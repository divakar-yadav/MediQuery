All patients benefited from the S 100b protein assay, copeptin and brain MRI.","detailedDescription":"Vertigo is a frequent reason for visiting emergency departments. Differentiating stroke from other causes is challenging for physicians. The role of biomarkers has been poorly assessed. Evaluators evaluated whether copeptin and S100b protein assessment, alone or in combination, could rule out stroke in patients visiting emergency departments for vertigo.\n\nEvaluators included patients visiting the adult emergency departments of a French university hospital for a new episode of vertigo evolving for less than 72 hours. All patients underwent standardized physical examination (HINT \\[Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, test of skew deviation\\] maneuvers), copeptin and S-100b protein measurement and injected brain imaging. Stroke diagnosis involved diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging or, if not available, neurological examination and contrast brain CT scan compatible with the diagnosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vertigo, Peripheral","Vertigo, Brain Stem","Vertigo; Central","Vertigo; Cerebral"],"keywords":["vertigo","stroke","copeptin","S-100b protein","biomarkers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"PS100 concentrations were measured on serum samples by electro-chemiluminescence assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
