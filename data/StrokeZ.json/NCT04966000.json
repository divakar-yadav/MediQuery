After pretesting for type of neglect and its severity, they will have an MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Then they will complete 10 sessions of Prism Adaptation Therapy and complete neglect post-testing. Response to Prism Adaptation Therapy will be assessed by comparing neglect scores pre- and post-training. Traditional lesion mapping, structural and functional lesion disconnectivity analyses, and tract-based spatial statistics of DTI measures will be used to examine whether any patterns of damage/dysfunction are related to a diagnosis of aiming neglect and response to Prism Adaptation Therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Perceptual Disorders","Stroke","Biomarker"],"keywords":["stroke","Prism Adaptation Therapy","spatial neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"a single group pre-post pilot study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Prism Adaptation Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10 sessions (60 trials each) 1x/day of Prism Adaptation Therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Prism Adaptation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Prism Adaptation Therapy","description":"Participants wear goggles with built-in prisms (a 20-diopter lens) that shift the visual scene to the right.
