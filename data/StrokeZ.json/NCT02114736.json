Stiff knee gait is a frequent condition among stroke patients leading to reduce gait speed and increase energy cost. In association with neuro-rehabilitation, botulinum toxin A injections in the rectus femoris is recommended. However, the botulinum toxin A effect is transient necessitating repeated injections.\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the benefit of the rectus femoris tenotomy in comparison with botulinum toxin A injections according to the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health of the World Health Organisation","detailedDescription":"INTRODUCTION\n\nStroke is the third cause of death and the leading cause of handicap among industrialized countries. Spasticity and co-contraction of the rectus femoris muscle following stroke is responsible for a lack of knee flexion in the swing phase of gait named stiff knee gait.\n\nThe rectus femoris spasticity is usually treated by oral medications, physical therapy and botulinum toxin A injections (1,2). As botulinum toxin A has a transient effect, injections must be repeated supporting to promote a permanent surgical treatment such as the rectus femoris tenotomy (3). However, no study has evaluate neither compare the effect of the rectus femoris tenotomy on gait and on the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health .\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nTo compare the effect of the rectus femoris tenotomy and of the botulinum toxin A injections for stiff knee gait after stroke according to the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe investigators will recruited 20 chronic stroke patients presenting with stiff knee gait. The patients will be randomly assigned to a surgical group treated by rectus femoris tenotomy (10 patients) and to a medical group treated by rectus femoris botulinum toxin A injections.\n\nPatients will be assessed before treatment, 2 months and 6 months after treatment by an assessor blinded therapist among the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health\n\nPERSPECTIVE\n\nThe investigator hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of the rectus femoris tenotomy as a treatment of stiff knee gait after stroke"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity"],"keywords":["Stroke","Muscle spasticity","Stiff knee gait","Botulinum toxin","Tenotomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rectus femoris tenotomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Surgical release of the proximal tendon of the rectus femoris","interventionNames":["Procedure: Tenotomy of the proximal rectus femoris tendon"]},{"label":"Botulinum toxin in the rectus femoris muscle","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Botulinum toxin (200U Botox) injection in the rectus femoris muscle","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum Toxin injection in the rectus femoris muscle"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Tenotomy of the proximal rectus femoris tendon","description":"Surgical release of the proximal tendon of the rectus femoris","armGroupLabels":["Rectus femoris tenotomy"],"otherNames":["Rectus femoris tenotomy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum Toxin injection in the rectus femoris muscle","description":"Injections of 200U of Botox in the rectus femoris muscle with a 2ml/100U dilution","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum toxin in the rectus femoris muscle"],"otherNames":["Rectus femoris botulinum toxin A injections"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ashworth scale at the rectus femoris","description":"Spasticity assessment scale","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke impairment assessment set (SIAS","description":"Body function and structure scale for stroke patients","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Tardieu scale","description":"Spasiticty assessment scale","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"MRC (Medical research Council) scale","description":"Muscle strength scale","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Isometric muscle strenght assessment","description":"Objective muscle strenght with isometric dynamometer","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"10 meter walking test","description":"Gait speed assessment scale","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Instrumented gait analysis","description":"Kinetic and kinematic gait assessment in gait laboratory","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"ABILOCO scale","description":"Activity level scale for gait validated according to Rasch model","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"EQ-5D-5L scale","description":"Health quality of life scale","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke lasting for more than 6 months\n* stiff knee gait\n* rectus femoris spasticity (\\> Ashworth 2)\n* transient improvement with previous botulinum toxine A injection in the rectus femoris\n* stiff knee gait improved after rectus femoris diagnostic motor nere block\n* able to walk on treadmill\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnant women\n* botulinum toxin A injections in the rectus femoris \\< 6 months\n* previous surgery for stiff knee gait","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thierry Deltombe, M.D.","affiliation":"University Hospital of Mont-Godinne, UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital of Mont-Godinne","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Yvoir","zip":"5530","country":"Belgium","contacts":[{"name":"Thierry Deltombe, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+ 32 81 42 37 72","email":"thierry.deltombe@uclouvain.be"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":50.3279,"lon":4.88059}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18164331","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Stoquart GG, Detrembleur C, Palumbo S, Deltombe T, Lejeune TM.
