This minimal invasive technique, also permits continuous beat-to-beat assessment.\n\nIn patients in who an arterial catheter is placed for clinical reasons, the hemodynamic variables are continuously recorded. An extension line is coupled to a 3-way stopcock, connected to the proAQT sensor. In a neutral position of the 3-way stopcock, the pressure wave travels from the pressure sensor through the standard line. By turning the handle of the stopcock the standard line is bypassed and the pressure wave travels through the extended line.\n\nThe hemodynamic registration will be as follows:\n\n* two minutes in the neutral position;\n* two minutes with one type of extension line\n* two minutes in the neutral position\n* two minutes with a second type of extension line\n* two minutes in neutral position\n\nThe arterial pressure curve and all calculated hemodynamic variables are electronically registered.\n\nThe influence of two types of extension lines on the accuracy of the calculated hemodynamic variables will be evaluated by comparing the variables measured in neutral position and variables measured with the extended pressure lines. The changes in the calculated variables will be correlated to possible arterial pressure waveform modifications and used to evaluate different algorithms, which might be used to reconstruct the primary pressure wave."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodynamic Instability"],"keywords":["cardiac output","pulse contour analysis","stroke volume","hemodynamic monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pulse contour disturbance","description":"Patients with an arterial catheter and pressure line extensions.","interventionNames":["Other: Pressure line extensions"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Pressure line extensions","description":"Two types of extension lines are connected:\n\n* Perfusor® line 150cm (polyethylene)\n* conventional arterial extension line","armGroupLabels":["Pulse contour disturbance"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"relative change in ProAQT-calculated cardiac output after placement of extension lines.","description":"relative change (in % of the baseline measurement) in cardiac output following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the arterial pressure wave form after placement of extension lines.","description":"The relative chane in AUC of the arterial pressure curve (from start systole to dicrotic notch) following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."},{"measure":"relative change in ProAQT-calculated SVR after placement of extension lines.","description":"relative change (in % of the baseline measurement) in systemic vascular resistance following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."},{"measure":"relative change in ProAQT-calculated diastolic blood pressure after placement of extension lines.","description":"relative change (in % of the baseline measurement) in diastolic blood pressure following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."},{"measure":"relative change in ProAQT-calculated systolic blood pressure after placement of extension lines.","description":"relative change (in % of the baseline measurement) in systolic blood pressure following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."},{"measure":"relative change in ProAQT-calculated stroke volume variation after placement of extension lines.","description":"relative change (in % of the baseline measurement) in stroke volume variation following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."},{"measure":"relative change in ProAQT-calculated pulse pressure variation after placement of extension lines.","description":"relative change (in % of the baseline measurement) in pulse pressure variation following increase in length of the extension line.","timeFrame":"one minute of measurement after changing the length of the extension line."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ASA 1-2\n* arterial catheter necessary for clinical reasons\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* ≥ASA 3","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult hospitalized patients for which arterial pressure measurement is needed.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Alain Kalmar, MD, PhD, MSc","affiliation":"Maria Middelares Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"AZ Maria Middelares","city":"Ghent","state":"Oost-Vlaanderen","zip":"9000","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05,"lon":3.71667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
