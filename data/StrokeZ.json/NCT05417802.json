Investigators will use a questionnaire and show a video of robotic therapy to ask questions on their interest.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this research is to investigate the interest of individuals with recent stroke in robotic therapy. Investigators will introduce a novel robotic platform to train ADLs of stroke patients. Investigators will examine the usability of this device as a home trainer for training rotational hand manipulation tasks such as opening a pickle jar, turning a key, missing a pot with a ladle, etc. The device will especially target stroke patients with ischemic stroke to enhance the performance of ADL. Also, investigators will examine the frequency and dosage of the current occupational therapy, followed by the satisfaction of the current therapy. Participant's participation will contribute to the development of a new therapy method using a robotic device for home-based training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke with acute stroke","description":"Inclusion criteria\n\n* Episode of single stroke within the past twelve weeks\n* Individuals' age over 18 years old.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* Pregnant women , neurological disorders other than stroke (i.e. Parkinson's), non-ischemic stroke\n* Individuals with severe cognitive impairments (demonstrating difficulty to understand, read, and answer the questions in writing)\n* Individuals with difficulties to listen the instruction and video of the robotic device"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Current Therapy question -
