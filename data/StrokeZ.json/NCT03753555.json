Many studies mainly from Euro-American population with a focus on extracranial carotid plaque have fully demonstrated the advantages of intensive statin therapy on stabilizing or reversing plaque burden, reversing plaque composition presenting that lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) is gradually replaced by fibrous tissue, and even reversing pattern of arterial remodeling to reduce the occurrence of cerebrovascular events. Yet, direct evidence of the effect of intensive statin therapy on intracranial atherosclerotic plaques is lacking and the effect of statin intensity and duration on intracranial plaque burden and composition is still unclear. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) is a new and non-invasive technique that enable to assess the morphologic characteristics of vascular wall and plaque composition of intracranial artery. Based on above discussion, the investigators conduct this study to further determine the effect of intensive statin in ischemic stroke with intracranial atherosclerotic plaques."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Atherosclerosis, Cerebral"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Routine-dose statin group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Routine-dose statin group will be gaven the treatment of atorvastatin 20mg Qd for 12 months","interventionNames":["Drug: Atorvastatin Calcium"]},{"label":"high-dose statin or PCSK9 inhibitor group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"high-dose statin group will be gaven the treatment of atorvastatin 40-80mg Qd till 6 months at the moment the subjects will be followed up to determine plaques status by HRMRI examination, among which the subjects presenting culprit plaque progression with the significant increasing of plaque burden including intraplaque hemorrhage will be again randomized into two groups at a ratio of 1:1 as followed: atorvastatin-probucol group will be administrated atorvastatin 40-80mg Qd plus probucol 0.5g Bid till 12 months, the other group will maintain the original scheme till 12 months.\n\nPCSK9 inhibitor group will receive the subcutaneous injection of Evolocumab (140mg, 2 / month) for one year.","interventionNames":["Drug: Atorvastatin Calcium","Drug: Probucol","Drug: PCSK9 inhibitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atorvastatin Calcium","description":"20mg Qd for 12 months","armGroupLabels":["Routine-dose statin group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atorvastatin Calcium","description":"40-80mg Qd for 6 months","armGroupLabels":["high-dose statin or PCSK9 inhibitor group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Probucol","description":"0.5g Bid for 6 months","armGroupLabels":["high-dose statin or PCSK9 inhibitor group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"PCSK9 inhibitor","description":"Evolocumab 140mg subcutaneously injected, twice each month","armGroupLabels":["high-dose statin or PCSK9 inhibitor group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in remodeling index after the statin treatment","description":"remodeling index: crimed vessel area/normal vessel area on high-resolution MRI","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Changes in plaque burden after the statin treatment","description":"plaque burden: crimed vessel wall area/crimed vessel area on high-resolution MRI","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Changes plaque composition in after the statin treatment","description":"plaque composition: lipid core and fiber tissue of plaque on high-resolution MRI","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months after treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"level of serum bio-markers compared with baseline","description":"Serum level of LDL、hs-CRP、sLOX1 and oxLDL","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"level of serum bio-markers compared with baseline","description":"Serum level of LDL、hs-CRP、sLOX1 and oxLDL","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"mRS (0-2)","description":"proportion of mRS (0-2)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"mRS (0-2)","description":"proportion of mRS (0-2)","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"vascular events","description":"incidence of Transient ischemic attack, stroke or other vascular events","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"vascular events","description":"incidence of Transient ischemic attack, stroke or other vascular events","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"abnormal test data","description":"incidence of abnormal liver function or muscle enzyme levels","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"any adverse event","description":"incidence of adverse event","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"death of any causes","description":"proportion of death","timeFrame":"12months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
