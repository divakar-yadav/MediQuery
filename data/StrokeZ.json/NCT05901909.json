Considering that stroke patients are especially elderly individuals, it is seen that they receive home health services and need a caregiver. The caregiver feels themselves under a heavy burden due to the lack of knowledge and insufficient experience. In addition, the lack of social support levels and the lack of training in patient care cause negative effects on patient outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The research will be carried out face-to-face with 70 stroke patients who receive health care from the home health services unit of a State Hospital and 70 individuals who care for these patients between July 2023 and December 2023. This study is a single-sample study with its own control group. During the implementation phase of the research, home visits will be made to the patients and training based on the Precede-Proceed model will be given to the individuals who care for the patients in the meeting room of the hospital where the research will be conducted. The collection of research data will take place in three stages. In the research, pre-education evaluation will be collected at the hospital before the training for the caregivers and home visits for the patients. In the second stage, the training program planned for the caregivers will be implemented in the meeting room of the hospital. After the training program reaches all of the caregivers in the determined number, the first evaluation will be made for the caregivers and the patient in the 8th week after the training is over. The third stage is the 16th week after the completion of the training, and the final evaluation will be made for the patients and caregivers. In the study, data will be collected using the individual caregiver personal information form, the caregiver response rating scale and the multidimensional perceived social support scale, and the patient personal information form for the patients. Statistical significance level will be accepted as p\\<0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Home Care Services","Caregivers","Social Support","Patient-Relevant Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"two groups","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke home care patient","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Before applying the education program based on the Precede-Proceed Model to 70 individuals who care for stroke home care patients, the evaluation of the patients will be made with home visits.
