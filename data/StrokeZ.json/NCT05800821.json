Most studies report incidences of CHS of 1-3% after carotid endarterectomy. CHS is most common in patients with increases of more than 100% in perfusion compared with baseline after carotid revascularization procedures and is rare in patients with increases in perfusion less than 100% compared with baseline.\n\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of CHS remains only partially understood. The chronic lowflow state induced by severe carotid disease results in a compensatory dilation of cerebral vessels distal to the stenosis, as part of the normal autoregulatory response, to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF). In this chronically dilated state, the vessels lose their ability to autoregulate vascular resistance in response to changes in blood pressure. In fact, it has been shown that this dysautoregulation is proportional to the duration and severity of chronic hypoperfusion. After revascularization and reperfusion, the impaired cerebral autoregulation could then contribute to a cascade of intracranial microcirculatory changes, as explained above, with an inability of reaction toward the augmentation of the CBF after the carotid recanalization.\n\nAlthough most patients have mild symptoms and signs, progression to severe and life-threatening symptoms can occur if CHS is not recognised and treated adequately. Because CHS is a diagnosis based on several non-specific signs and symptoms, patients may be misdiagnosed as having one of the better-known causes of perioperative complications like thromboembolism."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Carotid Atherosclerosis","Carotid Artery Stenosis","Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome"],"keywords":["Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome","Carotid Stenosis","Stroke","Deep Learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with reduced cerebrovascular reserve","interventionNames":["Procedure: Carotid revascularization"]},{"label":"Patients with sufficient cerebrovascular reserve","interventionNames":["Procedure: Carotid revascularization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Carotid revascularization","description":"Carotid revascularization","armGroupLabels":["Patients with reduced cerebrovascular reserve","Patients with sufficient cerebrovascular reserve"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome","description":"The diagnosis of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome will be based on the following criteria:\n\n1.
