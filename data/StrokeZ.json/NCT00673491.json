Prompt identification of symptoms, organised timely and efficient transportation towards appropriate facilities, has become essential part of effective treatment, as well as organized rehabilitation. The importance of organized stroke care in facilitating recovery has been recognized for the last 10 years, but it is still unclear how organized care contributes to improved outcomes. Since clinical pathways aim to promote evidence- and guideline-based care, improve the organisation and efficiency of care, and reduce cost, their implementation may be a method for achieving the organizational standards required to grant appropriate care in stroke. Even though in the past decade, care pathways have been increasingly implemented as a tool in acute stroke care and stroke rehabilitation the evidence supports partially the use of clinical pathways in stroke because very little prospective controlled data demonstrated their effectiveness through the continuum of the care. Our study was designed in order to conduct a rigorous evaluation of clinical pathways for treatment of acute stroke patients in different types of organized stroke care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Critical Pathways","Stroke","Randomized Controlled Trial","Effectiveness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":448,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients treated according to clinical pathways","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical Pathways"]},{"label":"2","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients treated according to usual care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical Pathways","description":"Clinical pathways are a methodology for the mutual decision making and organization of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period.
