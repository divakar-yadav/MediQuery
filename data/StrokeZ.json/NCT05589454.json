In patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, the relative and absolute risks of intracranial hemorrhage increase more rapidly than the risk of ischemic stroke with the increase of cerebral microbleeds burden, but the absolute incidence of ischemic stroke is still higher than that of cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nIt has been generally accepted that statins can effectively prevent recurrent ischemic stroke by reducing serum lipid levels. However, both low serum lipid levels and high dose of statins are clear risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage, and the reduction of major serum lipid levels may increase the risk of cerebral microbleeds. Of note, the risk of statin mediated hemorrhage appears to depend on the degree of lipid reduction rather than statin use per se. These observations raise concerns about the safety of lipid-lowering therapy, especially intensive lipid-lowering therapy, in patients with acute ischemic stroke and cerebral microbleeds who are at high risk for future intracranial hemorrhage. It is still not clear that how to carry on the proper management of serum lipid levels in this particular population to reduce the recurrence of ischemic events as well as hemorrhagic events, for there is still a lack of clinical studies to explore the risk and benefit of different doses of statins to achieve different degrees of lipid regulation.\n\nSo, if it is proved that excessive reduction in serum lipid levels by intensive statin therapy in acute ischemic stroke patients with cerebral microbleeds can increase the risk of future intracranial hemorrhage, we will inform new clinical decisions regarding the long-term lipid management in these patients with dilemma in clinical practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Cerebral
