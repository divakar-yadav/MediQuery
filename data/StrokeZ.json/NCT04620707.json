However, the healthcare systems are not able to respond to the current demand let alone its future increase. There is a need to deploy new approaches that advance current rehabilitation methods and enhance their efficiency.\n\nOne of the latest approaches used for the rehabilitation of a wide range of deficits of the nervous system is based on virtual reality (VR) applications, which combine training scenarios with dedicated interface devices. Market drivers exist for new ICT based treatment solutions. IBEC/ Eodyne Systems has developed and commercialised the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS), a science-based ICT solution for neurorehabilitation combining brain theory, AI, cloud computing and virtual reality and targeting motor and cognitive recovery after stroke. RGS provides a continuum of evaluations and therapeutic solutions that accompany the patient from the clinic to the therapy centre. RGS has been clinically validated showing its superiority over other products while reducing cost also through its use of standard off-the-shelf hardware and a Software as a Service model (SaaS). Commercial evaluations have shown that RGS acts as a workforce multiplier while delivering a high quality of care at clinical centres (RGS@Clinic). However, in order to achieve significant benefits in the patients' QoL, it is essential that RGS becomes an at home solution providing 24/7 monitoring and care. For this reason, this project aims at investigating the RGS acceptability and adoption model.\n\nThe findings derived from this study will contribute to establish a novel and superior neurorehabilitation paradigm that can accelerate the recovery of hemiparetic stroke patients. Besides the clinical impact, such achievement could have relevant socioeconomic impact."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA","Stroke, Acute","Motor Disorders","Spasticity, Muscle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RGS based therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: RGS based training and monitoring"]},{"label":"Treatment as usual","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Therapy as usual"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RGS based training and monitoring","description":"The RGS treatment will consist in a variable number of sessions per week of RGS-based training.
