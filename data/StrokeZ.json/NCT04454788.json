Need to be DBS +ve to be study eligible.\n* Presence of a vessel occlusion on CTA or MRA. LVO will be defined as 'potentially retrievable' thrombus at one or more of the following sites: intracranial internal carotid (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) first segment (M1), proximal middle cerebral artery second segment (M2) or isolated/tandem occlusion of the extracranial ICA. Patients with an extracranial ICA stenosis and occlusion are also eligible.\n* Presence of 'target mismatch' on automated perfusion CT (CTP) or diffusion-perfusion MRI software defined as an ischemic core of \\<70mL, penumbra of \\>20mL and an ischemic core to perfusion lesion ratio of \\>1.8\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or other diagnosis (e.g. tumor).\n* Basilar Artery occlusion.\n* Extensive early ischemic change (hypodensity on NCCT or high signal on DWI-MRI) or early ischemic change outside the perfusion lesion that invalidates mismatch criteria.\n* Pre-stroke mRS score of \\> 2 (indicating significant previous disability) or DBS -ve.\n* Any terminal illness such that patient would not be expected to survive more than 1 year\n* Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator could impose hazards to the patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in the study.\n* Pregnant women.\n* Other standard contraindications to thrombolysis.\n* Minor stroke symptoms, or major stroke symptoms rapidly improving\n* Clinical presentation suggesting subarachnoid haemorrhage\n* Known bleeding diasthesis and/or platelet count \\<100,000 or taking warfarin with INR \\> 1.7.\n* Patients who have received heparin within 48 hours must have normal aPTT.\n* Major surgery or serious trauma within 14 days, serious head trauma within 3 months.\n* GI or urinary tract haemorrhage within last 21 days\n* Arterial puncture at a non-compressible site or lumbar puncture within 7 days\n* Systolic BP \\> 185, diastolic BP \\> 110mmHg\n* Clinical stroke within 3 months or history of ICH\n* Unable to gain consent from patient or person responsible\n* Known severe renal impairment (GFR \\<
