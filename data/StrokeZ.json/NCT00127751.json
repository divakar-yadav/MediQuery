Patients were randomized to case management (99) or usual care (49) with baseline, 6-month and 12-month evaluations of CVD risk factors, clinical status and quality of life. Subjects were primarily recruited from patients being seen in free medical clinics in Santa Clara County California. Primary eligibility was ≥ 35 years of age, one or more CVD risk factors (with or without clinical CVD), low family income, and residing in Santa Clara County. Patients in the case management group were provided counseling services by specially trained registered nurses (RNs) and registered dieticians (RDs) and assisted in obtaining medications and medical services from programs provided in the county or indigent drug programs provided by selected pharmaceutical companies. Protocol driven treatment algorithms based on national practice guidelines were used and use of existing programs and resources were maximized. On average patients in case management were seen by staff 6-9 in the 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Heart Disease","Stroke","Hyperlipidemia","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Risk factor reduction","cardiovascular disease prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Enhance health lifestyle changes and medication compliance"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular disease risk score"},{"measure":"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol"},{"measure":"Systolic blood pressure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Body mass index (BMI)"},{"measure":"Physical activity score"},{"measure":"Nutrition score"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men and women ≥ 35 years\n* One or more major risk factors\n* Live in Santa Clara County\n* Low family income that limits access to medical care\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Under active medical treatment for cancer, CVD or other major medical disorder\n* Reasonable access to health care\n* Under 35 years of age\n* Not a resident of Santa Clara County","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"William L Haskell, PhD","affiliation":"Stanford University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Stanford University School of Medicine","city":"Stanford","state":"California","zip":"94305","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.42411,"lon":-122.16608}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000006949","term":"Hyperlipidemias"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000050171","term":"Dyslipidemias"},{"id":"D000052439","term":"Lipid Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Coronary Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","asFound":"Coronary Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9690","name":"Hyperlipidemias","asFound":"Hyperlipidemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","asFound":"Coronary Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","asFound":"Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9692","name":"Hyperlipoproteinemias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25871","name":"Dyslipidemias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26719","name":"Lipid Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
