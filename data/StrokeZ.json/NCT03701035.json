The training modalities are 1. moderate intensity aerobic training on a bike ergonometer followed by robotic or sensor-based upper-limb training, 2. non-aerobic circuit training followed by robotic or sensor-based upper-limb training 3. circuit training alone.","detailedDescription":"Background and Rationale:Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to a group of neurotrophins which influence neuroplasticity by increasing long-term potentiation and axonal and dendritic growth. Levels of serum BDNF are increased following moderate intensity aerobic exercise (MAE) in animal and healthy subjects. The influence of MAE on BDNF following stroke and the resultant efficacy of motor training in this environment remains unclear.\n\nObjective(s):To investigate the influence of MAE on acute and chronic levels of serum BDNF in sub-acute and chronic stroke patients, the efficacy of robotic upper limb or sensor based motor task training in this environment and consequent effect on functional arm recovery compared to the same upper limb training following non-aerobic training circuit training, or non-aerobic circuit training alone To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Study Interventions: Group 1: moderate intensity AE 40 minutes, 3 times weekly followed after 20 minutes break by 40 minutes robotic or sensor-based upper-limb Training. Group2: non-aerobic gait and balance circuit training 40 mins 3 times weekly followed after 20 minutes break by 40 minutes robotic or sensor-based upper-limb training, group 3: 40 minutes non-aerobic gait and balance circuit training.In total 45 participants will be enrolled - 15 in each group.Study Duration:3 monthly Intervention period per intervention group, with a 3 month and 6 month follow-up. ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aerobic Training & UL Motor Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Aerobic training at 40%-59% Heart Rate Reserve (AT) increasing from personal maximum time (if \\< 40 mins) to 40 minutes followed by UL motor training with the Armeo®Spring/Senso/Pablo X2® 3 \\* weekly, 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic Training & UL Motor Training"]},{"label":"Non-aerobic Training & UL Motor Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"40 minutes non-aerobic gait \\& balance circuit training followed by UL motor training with the Armeo®Spring/Senso/Pablo X2® 3 \\* weekly, 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Non-aerobic training & UL Motor Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Aerobic Training & UL Motor Training","description":"Aerobic training at 40%-59% Heart Rate Reserve (AT) increasing from personal maximum time (if \\< 40 mins) to 40 minutes followed by UL motor training with the Armeo®Spring/Senso/Pablo X2®","armGroupLabels":["Aerobic Training & UL Motor Training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Non-aerobic training & UL Motor Training","description":"40 minutes non-aerobic gait \\& balance circuit training followed by UL motor training with the Armeo®Spring/Senso/Pablo X2®","armGroupLabels":["Non-aerobic Training & UL Motor Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"BDNF","description":"Acute (immediate post exercise) and chronic (post-intervention) serum BDNF levels","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","description":"A 19-Item standardised assessment of UL function measuring ADLs, coordination \\& dexterity.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Upper Extremity Scale (FMA).","description":"Instrument for measuring upper limb impairment after stroke.
