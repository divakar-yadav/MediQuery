Multipolar catheters were positioned in the coronary sinus, His, and the right atrium. The three-dimensional LA geometry was reconstructed using a CARTO or NavX electroanatomical mapping system. Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation was performed in all patients using a irrigated-tip catheter. A circular mapping catheter was used to confirm the isolation of the pulmonary veins. Successful ablation was defined by the elimination of all the pulmonary vein potentials along the antrum or inside the veins. If the AF was not terminated after elimination of all the pulmonary vein potentials, linear ablation and complex fragmented atrial electrogram ablation were performed.","armGroupLabels":["ablation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence rate of AF/AFL/AT in both groups","description":"recurrence of AF/AFL/AT evaluated using device interrogation","timeFrame":"1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"Recurrence rate of AF/AFL/AT in both groups","description":"recurrence of AF/AFL/AT evaluated using device interrogation","timeFrame":"6-month follow up to 5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Left ventricular ejection fraction","description":"cardiac function evaluated using echocardiography","timeFrame":"1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"Left atrial diameter","description":"cardiac function evaluated using echocardiography","timeFrame":"1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"Stroke","description":"ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"at least 1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"Stroke","description":"ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"6-month follow up to 5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who developed atrial fibrillation/flutter/tachycardia after pacemaker implantation among AF-pacemaker study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03303872).\n* Age: 18-80 years\n* Patients eligible for the indications for permanent pacemaker implantation in accordance with 2016 revised Korean indication guideline on cardiac pacemaker implantation\n* Estimated percentage of atrial pacing \\>40% under sinus rhythm (LR≥60bpm, close hysteresis and rest rate)\n* Estimated percentage of ventricular pacing \\>40% under sinus rhythm (LR≥40bpm, DDD pacing, close hysteresis and rest rate)\n* Patients who are willing to sign the informed consent.\n* Patients who are willing to receive the implantation and post-operative follow-up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persistent or permanent AF\n* Severe hepatic and renal insufficiency (AST or ALT ≥ three times of normal upper limit;
