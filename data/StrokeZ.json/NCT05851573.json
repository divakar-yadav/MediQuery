Living with aphasia can have devastating effects on communication and quality of life, and it is not uncommon for survivors with aphasia to face psychological problems like depression and anxiety. Participants who are eligible for this study will undergo baseline testing, engage in a 5-week treatment focused on psychological well-being, undergo post-treatment testing, and then testing again 1-month later. Check-in phone calls will be conducted during the 1-month off period and participants will be interviewed about their experience at the end of the study as well. Compensation will be provided to participants with aphasia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Psychosocial intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Psychosocial intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Psychosocial intervention","description":"an SLP-administered 5-week treatment focused on psychological well-being","armGroupLabels":["Psychosocial intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 1-Month Follow-Up","description":"Change in the total depression and anxiety Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores between baseline and at 1-month post-treatment.
