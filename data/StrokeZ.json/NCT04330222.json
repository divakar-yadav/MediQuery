We will optimise 7T Time-of-Flight MR angiography, blood suppressed MR sequence and phase-contrast (PC) MR angiography for visualization of perforating lenticulostriate arteries. This optimised sequences will be used to determine the range of arterial pathologies seen in individuals presenting with lacunar strokes. The pathologies of the perforating lenticulostriate arteries will be correlated with conventional clinical risk factors, cognition and radiological markers of SVD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Cerebral Small Vessel Ischemic Disease","Lacunar Stroke"],"keywords":["Vascular Cognitive Impairment","Vascular Dementia","7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imagine (7T MRI)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":210,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with lacunar stroke due to SVD","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: 7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Other: Brief Memory and Executive Test"]},{"label":"Healthy stroke free volunteers","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: 7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging","description":"Diagnostic Imaging","armGroupLabels":["Healthy stroke free volunteers","Patients with lacunar stroke due to SVD"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Brief Memory and Executive Test","description":"Cognitive Assessment","armGroupLabels":["Patients with lacunar stroke due to SVD"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Range and pattern of pathology seen in the perforating arteries like presence or absence of focal atheroma and narrowing","timeFrame":"March 2020-"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Differences in morphology of perforating arteries between SVD patients and healthy volunteers","timeFrame":"March 2020-"},{"measure":"Correlation of morphology of perforating arteries with cardiovascular risk factors and radiological markers of SVD","timeFrame":"March 2020-"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
