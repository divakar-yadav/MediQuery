The candidate circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA will be verified as the biomarker and regulator for progression and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment. Further, the candidate non-coding RNA will be used to evaluate the effect of endovascular treatment on both peripheral and central immune after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Noncoding RNAs have been highlighted to be involved in the pathological process of ischemic stroke (IS). The purpose of this protocol will investigate the differentiated expression pattern of circular RNA (circRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA) by next-generation sequencing in acute ischemic stroke patients before and/or after endovascular treatment. The candidate circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA will be verified as the biomarker and regulator for progression and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment. Further, the candidate non-coding RNA will be used to evaluate the effect of endovascular treatment on both peripheral and central immune after stroke. Distinctive expression patterns of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be identified by the next-generation sequencing and individual quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A predictive model will be established using logistic regression. The panel of these altered ncRNAs may be associated with the immune status after acute IS and could serve as a regulator for progression and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Endovascular Treatment"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","noncoding RNA","endovascular treatment","clinical significance","outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"An 10 ml peripheral venous blood will be collected from the participants before and after endovascular treatment"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AIS before EVT group","description":"This group includes patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) before endovascular treatment (EVT)","interventionNames":["Genetic: Sequencing of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA"]},{"label":"AIS after EVT group","description":"This group includes patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) after endovascular treatment (EVT)","interventionNames":["Genetic: Sequencing of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Sequencing of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA","description":"Next generation sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of circular RNA (circRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA)","armGroupLabels":["AIS after EVT group","AIS before EVT group"],"otherNames":["Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Differential expression pattern of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA in acute ischemic stroke patients before and after endovascular treatment","description":"Differential expression pattern of circular RNA (circRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA) will be compared in acute ischemic stroke patients before and after endovascular treatment, thus candidate circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA will be verified as biomarkers and regulators for progression and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prognostic value of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA in acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment","description":"The prognosis of AIS patients will be analyzed between differential expressed candidate circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA after they have endovascular treatment.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Correlation of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA and inflammatory factors in acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment","description":"Correlation of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA and inflammatory factors in acute ischemic stroke before and after endovascular treatment will be explored.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Correlation of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA and stroke-associated infection","description":"Correlation of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA and stroke-associated infection will be explored in acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Dynamic changes of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA during the follow-up period","description":"Dynamic changes of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA will be explored after endovascular therapy during the follow-up period","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 18 years or older\n* Confirmed acute ischemic stroke by a diffusion-weighted imaging-position lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a new lesion on a brain computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Within 24 hours of symptom onset and treat with endovascular therapy\n* Good performance status\n* Signed an approved informed consents\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* a history of hemorrhagic infarction, chronic kidney/liver diseases, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, active malignant disease, and inflammatory or infectious diseases","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"There will be 5 AIS patients, whose data before and after endovascular treatment will be applied for sequencing the differentiated expression pattern and constraction of diagnosis and predictive models of circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA from the circulating blood.
