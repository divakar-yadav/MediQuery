Clinical observations suggest that the incidence of ACEI-induced dry cough is different between Chinese and other racial groups, however, there is still lack of research data in Chinese. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world and leading cause of death in China. Except the known risk factor such as hypertension, high homocysteine level, folic acid deficiency, the impact of genetics should not be ignored.\n\nIn this study, we will investigate whether there are specific genotypes which may predict the incidence of (1)enalapril-induced dry cough in Chinese and (2)first stroke in hypertensive patients taking enalapril or enalapril-folic acid therapy, so as to provide a basis for developing guidelines on precision medication in enalapril therapy apply to Chinese population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Enalapril Adverse Reaction","Pharmacogenomics","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"wild genotype","description":"Detection of genotype will be carried out through next generation sequencing, distinguish wild genotype of enalapril","interventionNames":["Genetic: detection of genotype"]},{"label":"mutant genotype","description":"Detection of genotype will be carried out through next generation sequencing, distinguish mutant genotype of enalapril","interventionNames":["Genetic: detection of genotype"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"detection of genotype","description":"detection of genotype by next generation sequencing","armGroupLabels":["mutant genotype","wild genotype"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of dry cough","timeFrame":"At 2 years"},{"measure":"First Incidence of stroke","timeFrame":"At 2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Genotype detected by next generation sequencing","description":"Collect blood specimen before enalapril administration, then detect genotype of enalapril by next generation sequencing.","timeFrame":"pre-dose of enalapril or enalapril-folic acid (Baseline)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients taking enalapril or enalapril-folic acid therapy\n* Signed informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients not taking enalapril treated\n* Intolerance or unwillingness to blood sample collection.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Chinese Patients:In accordance with anti-hypertension indications of enalapril","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Qian Xiang, Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86 010 66110802","email":"xiangqz@126.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Peking University First Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100034","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Qian Xiang, Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86 010 66110802","email":"xiangqz@126.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"32397904","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Mu G, Xiang Q, Zhang Z, Liu C, Zhang H, Liu Z, Pang X, Jiang J, Xie Q, Zhou S, Wang Z, Hu K, Wang Z, Jiang S, Qin X, Cui Y.
