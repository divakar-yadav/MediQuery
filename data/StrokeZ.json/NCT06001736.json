In the recovery phase after initial injury, neural reorganization occurs and has been observed in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Previous studies have identified contralesional (opposite to the side of the injury), in other words, ipsilateral, activation in the recovery of paretic hand function. However, this pathway of recovery is limited due to sparse connections between the ipsilateral hemisphere and the affected arm/hand. By establishing an anatomic connection between the ipsilateral hemisphere and the paretic arm with contralateral nerve transfer, compensatory capacity of the ipsilateral hemisphere is facilitated. This cross neck C7-C7 root transfer is an established procedure for the treatment of brachial plexus injuries and recently, for the treatment of spastic arm paresis in those with cerebral injury."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Spastic Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":95,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Contralateral C7 root transfer for the treatment of spastic hemiparesis.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The C7 nerve root transfer will occur to the patients on this arm.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Contralateral C7 root transfer for the treatment of spastic hemiparesis."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Contralateral C7 root transfer for the treatment of spastic hemiparesis.","description":"Performing surgery to transfer the C7 nerve to treat stroke patients experiencing spastic hemiparesis.","armGroupLabels":["Contralateral C7 root transfer for the treatment of spastic hemiparesis."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in arm function, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer upper-extremity scale.","description":"The Fugl-Meyer is a widely used and highly recommended stroke-speciÔ¨Åc, performance-based measure of impairment with 5 domains and a possible 226 points.","timeFrame":"12 months with visits at baseline and months 2, 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with resultant arm paresis that has ceased to improve within 1-5 years of rehabilitation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jennifer Hong, Dr.","affiliation":"Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Dartmouth-Health","city":"Lebanon","state":"New Hampshire","zip":"03677","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":43.64229,"lon":-72.25176}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009128","term":"Muscle Spasticity"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000083302","term":"Hemorrhagic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009135","term":"Muscular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000009122","term":"Muscle Hypertonia"},{"id":"D000020879","term":"Neuromuscular Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","asFound":"Spastic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2405","name":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke Hemorrhagic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11782","name":"Muscular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11787","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11769","name":"Muscle Hypertonia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22309","name":"Neuromuscular Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
