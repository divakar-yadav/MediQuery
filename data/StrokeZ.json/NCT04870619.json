These data will determine if the observed gains from the high-intensity gait training are retained after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"The study is a cohort-study that will have a prospective observational design. This design allows us to follow patients who presently have had a stroke and received high intensity stepping training over time. At this time little is known about the patient's functional trajectory the first 12 months after receiving high intensity stepping treatment as no study has examined long-term effects of high-intensity stepping training delivered in inpatient rehabilitation for stroke in Norway nor internationally."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["High Intensity Gait Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":69,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"High Intensity Gait Training","description":"The intervention provided in this project is routinely delivered as a standard of care at the participating sites for patients after stroke that have a goal of walking improvement. The intervention consists of 45-60 minute, physical therapy sessions that occur five days per week (not weekends), focusing on prioritizing stepping practice at higher aerobic intensities during scheduled treatments (target training zone of 70-85% heart rate max (HRmax). Stepping is performed on treadmills and over ground, with safety harness systems and body weight support only as needed to ensure successful stepping. Tasks are progressed by increasing task difficulty as determined by the therapist. Accordingly, practice of non-walking tasks performed during physiotherapy, including bed mobility, transfers, and standing balance/ pre-gait activities, is limited."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meter walk test","description":"Walking speed","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"6-minute walk test","description":"Walking distance","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Berg balance scale","description":"Balance measured on a scale 0-56 points, higher scores mean a better outcome","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Steps","description":"Number of Steps","timeFrame":"Daily through stay, average of 3 weeks"},{"measure":"Intensity","description":"Heart Rate during training","timeFrame":"Each PT session trough stay, and average of 3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sit-to-stand x5","description":"Functional strength, time to complete in sec","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Sit-to-stand x5","description":"Functional strength, time to complete in sec","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Sit-to-stand x5","description":"Functional strength, time to complete in sec","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Sit-to-stand x5","description":"Functional strength, time to complete in sec","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Manual muscle testing","description":"Strength of lower extremities, ordinal scale 0-5, higher score indicate better outcome","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Manual muscle testing","description":"Strength of lower extremities, ordinal scale 0-5, higher score indicate better outcome","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Manual muscle testing","description":"Strength of lower extremities, ordinal scale 0-5, higher score indicate better outcome","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Manual muscle testing","description":"Strength of lower extremities, ordinal scale 0-5, higher score indicate better outcome","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Action-Research-Arm-Test (ARAT)","description":"Evaluation tool for motot function in the upper extremity after neurological injuries.
