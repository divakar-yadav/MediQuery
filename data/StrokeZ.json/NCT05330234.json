Background: Arm disability is a common problem after stroke that can lead to loss of independence, it affects\n\n\\~450,000 people in the UK. Repetitive activity is critical for recovery but research shows people can struggle with intensity and keeping track of progress. The OnTrack system being developed at Imperial College London is a potential solution to this problem. Intervention: The OnTrack system consists of two software applications, OnTrack App - used by patients, and OnTrack Tools - used by clinicians. OnTrack Tools pulls data generated by the OnTrack App and enables the monitoring of clients' arm activity, and management of goals and educational content. The software is used to inform selfmanagement coaching by helping therapists understand more about how and when patients use their affected arm between treatment sessions. Design and methods: This study will assess the usability of the OnTrack Tools component of the system. The study will recruit stroke therapists from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to provide feedback on the experience and usability of OnTrack Tools' graphical user interface (GUI). The study will be divided into three progressive cycles of testing, feedback and iteration. Each cycle will see participants individually completing specific tasks related to system navigation and the management of patients under simulation. Participants will complete outcome measures and take part in focus groups. Researchers will analyse and use the feedback to improve the GUI ready for the next testing cycle. Patient and public involvement: The project team includes a PPIE group of stroke survivors who oversee the project and help us with public facing documentation. They are members of the research team and are reimbursed for their time and travel, according to INVOLVE guidance. Dissemination: Results of the study will be written-up for technical reporting and publication. Participants will be provided with a summary of results at the end of the study. The study team will be providing general updates on the progress of the study via their social media channels (e.g. Twitter @OnTrackRehab @ImperialIGHI @HelixCentre)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Research With Clinical Staff in Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["stroke, rehabilitation, neurology, digital health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This study aims to assess the usability of the OnTrack Tools GUI under simulation.
