According to published studies, it was hypothesized that acute ischemic stroke patients who were given astaxanthin would have lower plasma malondialdehyde levels and lower NIHSS score compared to the control group.","detailedDescription":"There were a total of 24 subjects, with 12 subjects in the intervention group and 12 subjects in the control group.The participants were divided into an interventional group and a control group.
