Approximately 30 to 40% of people in the acute phase of stroke also sustain communication impairments. Stroke-related cognitive impairments are associated with significant functional disability, as indicated by the inability to regain independence in daily activities. The overall aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of an adapted form of strategy training for people with communication impairments who are admitted to inpatient rehabilitation. These analyses will address a critical gap in current rehabilitation research, namely the exclusion of people with communication impairments in acute stroke rehabilitation clinical trials, and provide pilot data to inform the design of future inclusive clinical trials seeking to reduce disability after stroke.","detailedDescription":"This pilot study will use a descriptive case series design with repeated measures to assess the feasibility of an adapted form of strategy training for people with communication impairments after acute stroke. The investigators will recruit people with aphasia due to stroke admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation units and administer the adapted form of strategy training one session per day 5 days per week for 10-15 sessions. The investigators will assess the feasibility of the intervention based on feedback from participants and therapists. These data will serve as pilot data to inform the design of a future clinical trials for people with cognitive impairments after stroke, including people with communication impairments. These efforts will allow the investigators to test new models to support optimal interventions for individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments, including people with communication impairments who are among those most vulnerable for long-term disability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Strategy Training"],"keywords":["Stroke","Aphasia","Rehabilitation","Cognition","Disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Strategy Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Strategy training is a form of meta-cognitive instruction that trains individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments to identify and prioritize problematic daily activities, identify the barriers impeding performance, generate and evaluate their own strategies to address barriers, and apply these skills through iterative practice.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Strategy Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Strategy Training","description":"This study will use an adapted form of strategy training for people with communication impairments.","armGroupLabels":["Strategy Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Patient-therapist Communication Score","description":"Measure of Participation in Conversation (MPC) Interaction score greater than or equal to 2.
