We expect that transplantation of the peripheral blood CD34+ cells has the potential of significant benefit to neurological recovery. In a previous phase I clinical trial, we have shown that transplantation of CD34+ cells obtained from the peripheral blood of the chronic stroke patients was safe and beneficial for neurological recovery. We expect this trial can further prove the efficacy of this treatment method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction"],"keywords":["Stroke","Stem Cell","Cell Therapy","CD34 Stem cell","Peripheral blood Stem cell"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PBSC Treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in PBSC treatment will receive brain implant of autologous peripheral blood stem cell(CD34+) plus convention stroke treatment that include rehabilitation and antiplatelet medication","interventionNames":["Procedure: Intercerebral implantation of Autulogous Stem Cells"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group receive conventional stroke treatment that include rehabilitation and antiplatelet medication","interventionNames":["Drug: convention therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Intercerebral implantation of Autulogous Stem Cells","description":"2-8 millions Stem cell per patients plus convention therapy","armGroupLabels":["PBSC Treatment"],"otherNames":["PBSC","CD34 Stem Cell"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"convention therapy","description":"antiplatelet","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIH-stroke scale (NIHSS)","timeFrame":"1, 2, 4, 12 weeks, and confirmed at 6 and 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"European stroke scale (ESS)","timeFrame":"1, 2, 4, 12 weeks, and confirmed at 6 and 12 months"},{"measure":"European stroke motor subscale (EMS)","timeFrame":"1, 2, 4, 12 weeks, and confirmed at 6 and 12 months"},{"measure":"Barthel index and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)","timeFrame":"1, 2, 4, 12 weeks, and confirmed at 6 and 12 months"},{"measure":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans","timeFrame":"1, 2, 4, 12 weeks, and confirmed at 6 and 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* aged 35-70 chronic stroke adult patient,\n* with stroke history of more than 6 months, less than 60 months，\n* with stable hemiplegia condition, and\n* NIHSS (NIH Stroke Scale) score is between 9-20.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients aged less than 35 or more than 70,\n* hemorrhage stroke or MRI show the occlusion is not in the middle cerebral artery territory，NIHSS is not in the range of 9-20,\n* pregnant women,\n* impaired liver function, abnormal blood coagulation, AIDS, combine other tumor or special condition.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Shinn-Zong Lin, MD, DMSci","affiliation":"China Medical University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"China Medical University Hospital","city":"Taichung","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":24.1469,"lon":120.6839}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"22163120","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Mackie AR, Losordo DW.
