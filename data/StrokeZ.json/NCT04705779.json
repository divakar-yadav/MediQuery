Furthermore, AAW have inadequate engagement in exercise and are least successful at achieving and sustaining CM risk-reduction goals compared to all men and women of other racial/ethnic groups, despite participating in comprehensive lifestyle interventions. These alarming disparities are due in part to disproportionately high rates of psychological stress. A shortcoming of interventions with AAW is an inadequate focus on stress exposure, including gender and racialized stress, stress physiology, and stress-related barriers to healthy eating and exercise to reduce CM risk. In response, the HARMONY study is a randomized controlled trial to test a culturally-tailored nutrition and exercise intervention to manage stress, designed to help AAW build on their strengths to promote self-management and to reduce stress-related CM risk. Certain information about the interventions is not disclosed to protect the scientific integrity of the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Diseases","Stroke","Pre-diabetes","Hypertension","Obesity","Overweight","Stress"],"keywords":["HARMONY"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HARMONY","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Following screening, participation includes 8 regular sessions occurring over 4 months followed by 6 monthly booster sessions.
