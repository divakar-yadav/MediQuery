The level of functional recovery at rehabilitation discharge could better guide rehabilitation strategies to enhance independence and participation in daily life.\n\nThis study aims to determine, in patients after stroke, the optimal affected upper limb recovery threshold at rehabilitation discharge to predict spontaneous level of use of affected upper limb in activities of daily living, six month later.\n\nThis study is a multicentric prognostic prospective cohort study. The main prognostic variable will be the Action Arm Test (ARAT, Lyle, 1981) score at rehabilitation discharge and the predicted variable will be the Motor Activity Log - 28 (Taub et al. 1993) score at 6 months post discharge.","detailedDescription":"Adults after stroke will be recruited at post-acute rehabilitation discharge. Three evaluation times will be undertaken: at discharge, three and six months after discharge. Evaluation battery will focus on the three level of the Functioning International Classification: affected upper limb level of strength, proprioception and level of functional recovery, hemineglect, depression, cognition status, and activity level by doing a standardised instrumental task of daily living, and level of participation questionnaire. General characteristics will be taken into account: Age, social status, laterality.\n\nAt six months, the spontaneous level of affected upper arm use in daily living will also be assessed using accelerometers.\n\nAs the main aim of the study is to build a prediction model, the study size is calculated to observe a minimal number of events by potentially predictive variable. We consider here 7.5 events by independent variable (Vittinghof and McCulloch, 2007) and eight independent variables. According to literature review, we estimated that 35% of adults included in this study would spontaneously use their affected upper arm in activities of daily living six months after discharge. According to these data and considering 10% of protocol deviations, we calculated that 192 subjects will have to be included in the study. The inclusion duration will be 30 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["upper limb","functional recovery","activities of daily living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":192,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke","description":"* Patients over 18 years old leaving the correctional institution with orientation back home\n* First stroke deficit with non-regressive clinical expression in 24 hours\n* Independent in activities of daily living and living at home before stroke.
