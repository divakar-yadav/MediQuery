One group uses an afferent virtual reality program, and the other uses an efferent virtual reality program to train five times a week for a total of 4 weeks.\n\nBefore training, a computer experience scale 21 was additionally performed, and to find out the degree of unilateral negligence, evaluation was performed using the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)22, and the angle of deflection (deviation angle), out-of-focus time, gaze time, failure rate, and head rotation trajectory were evaluated. In addition, reaction time, failure rate, and head rotation trajectory were evaluated using a virtual reality program (Assessment program-V2) to evaluate the degree of unilateral negligence. After that, BIT, CBS, and Assessment program-V2 tests are performed to determine the degree of improvement in visual ignorance due to each program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Concentric","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"uses an afferent virtual reality program","interventionNames":["Device: afferent virtual reality program"]},{"label":"Eccentric","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"uses an efferent virtual reality program","interventionNames":["Device: efferent virtual reality program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"afferent virtual reality program","description":"When visual gaze training is applied to the left unilateral neglected patient, the gaze direction can be divided into an afferent direction closer to the body and an efferent direction away from the body.
