With rapidly aging population and increasing cancer prevalence, cancer related stroke has become an important stroke subtype. Recent studies suggest that hypercoagulability is associated with poor prognosis and effective correction of coagulopathy maybe protective for survival in cancer related stroke patients. Optimal strategies to correct coagulopathy in cancer stroke patient remains to be determined. Currently, the use of low molecular-weighted heparin is recommended in these patients, but non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) could be safe alternative without the need for injection subcutaneously. Furthermore, NOACs could be an optimal treatment strategy for cancer-related stroke in terms of correcting coagulopathy with less injection related complication (ex. pain and infection) compared to Enoxaparin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Correction of Cancer-related Coagulopathy With Novel Oral Anticoagulant (Edoxaban)"],"keywords":["cancer-related
