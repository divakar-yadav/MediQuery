Participants are recruited from Adventist Healthcare Rehabilitation Hospital. All participants must be less than one-month post-stroke with moderate UE hemiparesis. Eligible participants are randomly assigned to an experimental group, (MP or repetitive-task practice (RTP)), or the control group.\n\nThe MP groups will perform either audio-guided MP or video-guided MP, five days a week, with 20 repetitions of the following tasks: wiping a table, picking up a cup, brushing hair, and turning the pages of a book. The RTP group physically performed the same tasks. The control group received traditional stroke rehabilitation.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that video MP will have greater improvements in UE impairments and functional abilities than audio MP, RTP, and/or traditional therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis"],"keywords":["mental practice","stroke","upper extremity","hemiparesis","rehabilitation interventions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Audio MP","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants of the audio mental practice (MP) group will complete MP via audio-guided multisensory cues of one of four tasks: (1) wiping a table (2) picking up a cup (3) brushing hair and/or (4) turning the page of a book.
