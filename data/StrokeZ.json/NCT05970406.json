All participants will be asked to complete an informed consent form prior to admission to the study. Initial objective assessment of swallowing with video fluoroscopic swallowing assessment will be completed within 72 hours of admission to the unit. Participants with PAS scores of greater than or equal to 3 and FOIS scores of less than or equal to 6 will be admitted to the study and asked to complete the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) score sheets. Intensive swallowing interventions with Speech Language Pathologists will begin within 24 hours. Daily treatment will include two 30-minute sessions, 5-6 days a week which will include the evidence-based dysphagia exercises focusing on tongue resistance, head lift/chin tuck against resistance and expiratory muscle strength training tasks. Devices utilized will include the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI), and the Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Respironics device or the Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST150) device. Each session will involve IOPI measurements of lingual strength with endurance tasks set at 60% and 75% max strength scores to be completed for total of 10 attempts at each level for isometric and isokinetic tasks; Expiratory muscle strength training with EMST150 or PEP Respironics (dependent on strength levels) will be set at 75% max resistance levels per training method, for 25 completions per session; Shaker or Chin Tuck Against Resistance (CTAR) using 4.5 inch standard rubber ball - determined by patient positioning restrictions or tolerance- will be completed with goals of isometric hold for 1 minute x3 attempts and isokinetic x10 x3 attempts each session. At least one session per day will include consumption of ice chips and/or food dependent on PAS levels. At least one additional VFSS will be completed prior to discharge from study, as is standard of care within the JHBMC Rehab Unit. Outcome measures will be assessed with pre and post PAS scores (comparing initial and final VFSS results), EAT 10 scores and FOIS scores as well as documented improvements in IOPI and EMST/PEP levels at two-week intervals and will continue throughout the acute comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation unit (ACIR) stay as indicated. A follow up phone call with each participant will occur between 4-6 weeks post discharge from the and be completed with EAT-10 and FOIS over phone by Speech Language Pathologists or the investigator."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia Following Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Participants in high intensity dysphagia therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants with acute dysphagia who will receive high intensity dysphagia therapy during stay in inpatient rehab facility","interventionNames":["Other: high intensity dysphagia therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"high intensity dysphagia therapy","description":"Intensive swallowing interventions with Speech Language Pathologists to begin within 24 hours of video swallow study results.
