H1: Virtual reality training has an effect on balance in stroke patients.\n\nHypothesis 2; H0: Virtual reality training has no effect on activities of daily living in stroke patients.\n\nH1: Virtual reality training has an effect on daily living activities in stroke patients.\n\nHypothesis 3; H0: Virtual reality training has no effect on knee control in stroke patients. H1: Virtual reality training has an effect on knee control in stroke patients","detailedDescription":"In recent years, virtual reality systems are widely preferred technology-assisted rehabilitation methods due to the many advantages they provide in stroke rehabilitation. Virtual reality increases the quality of movement and functional capacity both by providing a sensory environment and by motor learning."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Virtual Reality","Stroke","Knee Hyperextension","Gait Analysis","Activities of Daily Living","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the conventional rehabilitation program, bed exercises, mat activities, balance exercises inside or outside the parallel bar and walking training will be given to the patients every weekday.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Virtual Reality Therapy Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in this group will be able to play balance-based games with the Virtual Reality System for 20 minutes, 3 days a week, together with the conventional rehabilitation program.","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual Reality Therapy","Other: Conventional Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual Reality Therapy","description":"Patients in this group will play balance-based games with the Virtual Reality System.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual Reality Therapy Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Rehabilitation","description":"In the conventional rehabilitation program, bed exercises, mat activities, balance exercises inside or outside the parallel bar and walking training will be given to the patients every weekday.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Rehabilitation Group","Virtual Reality Therapy Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Computerized Gait Assessment System (Zebris Rehawalk)","description":"Participants will walk at a comfortable walking speed on the treadmill.
