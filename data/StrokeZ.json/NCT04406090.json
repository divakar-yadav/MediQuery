Treatment-management and outcomes related to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for COVID-19 infected patients harboring large vessel occlusion is largely unknown.\n\nThis multicentric study aims to investigate morbidity, mortality and neurological outcomes after MT performed in patients with COVID-19 infection.","detailedDescription":"Since the identification of the first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 infection in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the global number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is roughly 5 000 000, with 216 involved countries. Increasing evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with neurological manifestations, with up to 36% of patients showing neurological symptoms related to the neurovirulence of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIt has been reported that roughly 5% of COVID-19 infected patients may present acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and these patients may have an unfavorable clinical evolution due to the systemic involvement of the infective disease. In addition, these patients are quite young: the mean age of COVID-19 patients having AIS is lower (56 years), compared to general population of AIS patients (mean age=73 years). Moreover, most of these patients require an intensive care units (ICU) management. Stroke mechanisms may be multiple and can include hypercoagulability from critical illness, cardioembolism from virus-related cardiac injury, and severe inflammation. Indeed, the dysfunction of endothelial cells induced by infection may promote an increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis; moreover, the hypoxia found in severe COVID-19 patients can be a trigger for thrombosis, increasing blood viscosity, and inducing hypoxia-inducible transcription factors.\n\nOutcomes related to the treatment of COVID-19 patients harboring large vessel occlusion and requiring MT is substantially unknown, but it is likely that the combined morbidity and mortality rate of the two pathologies is high. Accordingly, patient's selection, treatment-management, and results should be urgently elucidated.\n\nInvolving 4 different countries (France, Italy, Spain, and US), this multicentric cohort study aims to analyze the largest possible number of COVID-19 infected patients treated with MT for AIS, with the intention to provide treatment-results and neurological outcomes, elucidating the best patient-selection and treatment-management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Covid 19"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke related to large vessel occlusion","Mechanical Trombectomy","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"NONE_RETAINED","description":"NC"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mechanical Trombectomy","description":"Stent retriever for treatment of cerebral arterial occlusions"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intrahospital mortality","description":"Intrahospital mortality after MT for COVID-19 infected patients harboring large vessel occlusion","timeFrame":"1day"},{"measure":"short-term morbidity","description":"short-term morbidity after MT for COVID-19 infected patients harboring large vessel occlusion","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Angiographic success","description":"Angiographic success after MT for COVID-19 infected patients harboring large vessel occlusion","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n- Patients \\>18 years infected with the SARR-CoV-2 with acute ischemic stroke, and eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (based on the current guide-lines)\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n- Patients \\<18 years ; no eligibility to mechanical thrombectomy ; absence of diagnosis of COVID-19","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients \\>18 years infected with the SARR-CoV-2, presenting an acute ischemic stroke, and eligible to be treated with mechanical thrombectomy (based on the current guide-lines)","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Federico Cagnazzo, MD PhD","affiliation":"UH Montpellier","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Uhmontpellier","city":"Montpellier","zip":"34295","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.61092,"lon":3.87723}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33222617","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Cagnazzo F, Piotin M, Escalard S, Maier B, Ribo M, Requena M, Pop R, Hasiu A, Gasparotti R, Mardighian D, Piano M, Cervo A, Eker OF, Durous V, Sourour NA, Elhorany M, Zini A, Simonetti L, Marcheselli S, Paolo NN, Houdart E, Guedon A, Ligot N, Mine B, Consoli A, Lapergue B, Cordona Portela P, Urra X, Rodriguez A, Bolognini F, Lebedinsky PA, Pasco-Papon A, Godard S, Marnat G, Sibon I, Limbucci N, Nencini P, Nappini S, Saia V, Caldiera V, Romano D, Frauenfelder G, Gallesio I, Gola G, Menozzi R, Genovese A, Terrana A, Giorgianni A, Cappellari M, Augelli R, Invernizzi P, Pavia M, Lafe E, Cavallini A, Giossi A, Besana M, Valvassori L, Macera A, Castellan L, Salsano G, Di Caterino F, Biondi A, Arquizan C, Lebreuche J, Galvano G, Cannella A, Cosottini M, Lazzarotti G, Guizzardi G, Stecco A, Tassi R, Bracco S, Bianchini E, Micieli C, Pascarella R, Napoli M, Causin F, Desal H, Cotton F, Costalat V; ET-COVID-19 Study Group*.
