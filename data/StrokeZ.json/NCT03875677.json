The findings support that tDCS and motor practice can positively promote post-stroke motor learning to improve upper-limb motor recovery after stroke. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted with three groups: HD-tDCS, conventional tDCS and sham HD-tDCS. A 10-session training will be provided to evaluate the effectiveness of transient modulation of cortical excitability through tDCS with clinical assessment scores."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HD-tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Constant current (1mA) will be applied for 20min and the anode will be placed over the defined target area","interventionNames":["Device: HD-tDCS group"]},{"label":"Conventional tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Constant current (1mA) will be applied for 20min and the anode will be placed over the standard C3/C4 position","interventionNames":["Device: Conventional tDCS group"]},{"label":"Sham HD-tDCS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The stimulator will be shut down after 30s of stimulation.
