Distinct geographic disparities in stroke mortality, with highest rates in the southeast United States including Arkansas, are known as the \"stroke belt.\" There the average stroke mortality is ≈20% to 40% higher than the rest of the nation. Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability. Between 2012 and 2030, disability and medical costs related to stroke are projected to triple, from $71.6 billion to $184.1 billion, with the majority of the projected increase in costs arising from those 65 to 79 years of age.\n\nThere are two main forms of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic stroke occurs in 85% of cases and is caused by cerebral vessel occlusion, obstructing blood flow to a portion of the brain. Currently, the only approved therapies for acute ischemic stroke are IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent that clears the thrombus within the blood vessel, or intra-arterial catheter thrombectomy. Despite the availability of therapy, it reaches only approximately 7% of ischemic stroke victims in the United States5. Delay beyond the effective time window for therapy is a common reason for failure.\n\nTo reduce the devastating impact of stroke on individuals and society, the investigators continue to seek ways to improve functional recovery and limit ischemic damage in stroke patients. The potential neuroprotective agent, dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe) has recently shown strong positive effects in pre-clinical animal models of acute ischemic stroke6-11. Other perfluorocarbons have been tested in humans as potential neuroprotectants and blood substitutes yet none have been successful."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"0.05 mL/kg DDFPe","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, blinded escalating dose study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose to intravenous administration of DDFPe.
