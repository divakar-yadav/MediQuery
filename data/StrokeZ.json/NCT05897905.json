Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control group. Those in the intervention group will receive a follow-up telephone call at two weeks after discharge and a second follow-up appointment at six weeks after discharge. Outcome measures will be taken at twelve weeks after discharge."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Secondary prevention","Adjustment to life after stroke","Hidden
