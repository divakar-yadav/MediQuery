Dysphagia, one of the common complications of stroke, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical evaluation of swallowing in stroke patients and to determine the factors affecting the severity and prognosis of dysphagia in patients with dysphagia.Fifty-five patients with acute stroke and dysphagia who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital Neurology Clinic and diagnosed with stroke by neurology and who did not meet the exclusion criteria will be included in this study. When the patients are admitted to the neurology clinic and will be discharged, they will be evaluated three times, in the first month after discharge.","detailedDescription":"Stroke, also called cerebrovascular disease, is a sudden-onset neurological disorder that causes a regional or general dysfunction in the brain due to vascular causes.

When the patients are admitted to the neurology clinic and will be discharged, they will be evaluated three times, in the first month after discharge. Clinical evaluations will be made by the responsible investigator in the examination room. Patients will be evaluated with a bedside swallowing screening test. Patients will be divided into 3 groups as mild, moderate and severe dysphagia according to the test. The patients will be evaluated while they are in the neurology clinic and 1 month after the treatment is given."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mild dysphagia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Exercises for dysphagia rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Moderate dysphagia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Exercises for dysphagia rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Severe dysphagia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Exercises for dysphagia rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exercises for dysphagia rehabilitation","description":"Diet modifications, postural exercises, compensatory exercises, swallowing exercises","armGroupLabels":["Mild dysphagia","Moderate dysphagia","Severe dysphagia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gugging swallowing screening test","description":"The gugging test is a validated test in the assessment of bedside swallowing.
