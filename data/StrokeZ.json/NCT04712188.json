Persistent use of the upper limbs constitutes biomechanical difficulties, especially in the shoulder joint. The most commonly affected area in the shoulder is supraspinatus and biceps tendon. Four different stoke patterns have been classified in MWC users. Distinct amounts of force may be applied to the shoulder joint during propulsion with different stroke patterns and this can affect the shoulder tendons in different rates. In this study, investigators aimed to evaluate and compare the acute sonographic changes in supraspinatus and biceps tendons after a wheelchair propelling test in MWC users with SCI with different stroke patterns. Also, it is intended to determine the risk factors related to the stroke patterns that may be associated with these sonographic changes.","detailedDescription":"Fourty male MWC users with SCI were will be divided into 4 groups according to their stroke patterns (arcing, semicirculer, single loop, and double loop). Participants will use their own wheelchairs with their preferred stroke pattern for 20 minutes at a speed of 1 m / s on a motorized treadmill for a wheelchair propelling test. Wheelchair propelling videos will be recorded during the test. Shoulder kinematics will be analyzed using Kinovea motion analysis software and stoke pattern will be confirmed. Ultrasonographic assesment of participants' nondominant shoulder will be performed before and after testing procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury"],"keywords":["spinal cord injury","stroke pattern","ultrasonography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arcing","description":"10 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury using the \"arcing\" stroke pattern to propel manual wheelchair","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Musculoskeletal ultrasonography","Other: Wheelchair propelling test"]},{"label":"Semicirculer","description":"10 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury using the \"semicirculer\" stroke pattern to propel manual wheelchair","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Musculoskeletal ultrasonography","Other: Wheelchair propelling test"]},{"label":"Single loop","description":"10 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury using the \"single loop\" stroke pattern to propel manual wheelchair","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Musculoskeletal ultrasonography","Other: Wheelchair propelling test"]},{"label":"Double loop","description":"10 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury using the \"double loop\" stroke pattern to propel manual wheelchair","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Musculoskeletal ultrasonography","Other: Wheelchair propelling test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Musculoskeletal ultrasonography","description":"The ultrasonographic assesment will be used to examine the supraspinatus tendon thickness, the long head of the biceps brachii tendon thickness and acromio-humeral distance before and after wheelchair propelling test.","armGroupLabels":["Arcing","Double loop","Semicirculer","Single loop"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Wheelchair propelling test","description":"Participants will use their own wheelchairs with their preferred stroke pattern for 20 minutes at a speed of 1 m / s on a motorized treadmill for a wheelchair propelling test.
