The post-stroke subject underwent 30 sessions of balance-perturbed training while walking on an instrumented treadmill where the Balance Assessment Robot (BAR™) randomly delivered pushes to pelvis in various directions at various speeds and at various perturbation amplitudes. The investigators assessed kinematics, kinetics, electromiography and spatio-temporal responses to outward-directed perturbations commencing either at foot contact of the left or the right leg.","detailedDescription":"For a detailed description of the study, see the Arms and Interventions section."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["perturbed walking","stepping response"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Case - stroke survivor","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke survivor, 6mon post stroke resulting in right-sided hemiparesis, 53yrs old, had completed a 2mon rehabilitation program prior to the study. He underwent 30 training sessions with the Balance Assessment Robot (BAR™) within a 10-week period, each consisting of 10-15min of unperturbed treadmill and 30-45min of perturbation training. Perturbations were delivered in the forward, backward, left and right direction, occurring every 6sec, at the left leg initial contact and the right leg initial contact. Two training sessions were spent to determine adequate treadmill speed (0.4m/s) and perturbation amplitude (60N), followed by the first assessment session. After the last training session, assessment was repeated using the same parameters plus 90N perturbation amplitude.","interventionNames":["Device: Balance Assessment Robot (BAR™)"]},{"label":"Control - matched healthy subject","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Healthy male, height- and weight-matched to the Case.
