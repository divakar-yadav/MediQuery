The upper limb was examined in adduction of the humeral joint, with the elbow bent in the intermediate position between pronation and supination of the forearm, with free wrist and the hand.\n\nIn the supine position, the affected upper limb was stabilized at the subject's body (adduction in the humeral joint, elbow flexion in the intermediate position, wrist and hand free). The Hand Tutor device and an electronic hand dynamometer were used for the measurements. In each of the starting positions, after putting the glove on (using the Hand Tutor Device), the subject was asked to make moves as quickly and in as full a range as possible. Finally, the measurement of grip strength with a dynamometer was performed in both analyzed starting positions, after completing the range of motion and frequency tests."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["dominant hand","non-dominant hand","coordination","grip strength","stabilization","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"motor coordination and grip strength in dominant/non-dominant hand","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dominant and non-dominant hand motor coordination and grip strength were tested in the stable position of the trunk and the upper arm, in post-stroke patients (study group) and in healthy subjects (control group).","interventionNames":["Procedure: hand motor coordination in a sitting positin","Procedure: hand motor coordination in a supine position"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"hand motor coordination in a sitting positin","description":"The subject sat on the therapeutic table (without back support), feet resting on the floor.
