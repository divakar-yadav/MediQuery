Although treatment of high blood pressure is well established for thre prevention of stroke, it is unclear if high blood pressure observed immediately after stroke should be lowered.\n\nSeveral previous clinical trials have lowered blood pressure in acute stroke but this has not resulted in improved stroke outcome. One reason for this may be because treatment was started too late after stroke occurred. There is rapid progression of brain injury following stroke and any stroke treatment may need to be started very early to have a beneficial effect. Previous trials started blood pressure lowering after patients arrived at hospital and this was usually a significant time after stroke occurred.\n\nThe earliest time after stroke that blood pressure treatment could be started is during contact with the emergency medical services (paramedics). This research study is a pilot double blind randomised controlled trial of paramedic initiated blood pressure treatment for patients with high blood pressure immediately after stroke.\n\nPatients with high blood pressure and suspected acute stroke will be identified and offered the opportunity to participate in the study by research trained paramedics from the North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust. Patients who agree to participate in the study will receive either lisinopril (a common blood pressure lowering medication) or 'dummy' (placebo) treatments for seven days. The first dose of medication will be given by the paramedic in the ambulance. Subsequent tablets will be given in hospital. The effects of treatment will be monitored by measuring blood pressure, neurological outcome and adverse events.\n\nAll aspects of study feasibility including recruitment rates and compliance with data collection will be recorded. The study will run for one year and recruit 60 patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lisinopril","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental","interventionNames":["Drug: Lisinopril"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo Comparator","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Lisinopril","description":"5-10 mg Lisinopril per day for seven days, depending on blood pressure.","armGroupLabels":["Lisinopril"],"otherNames":["ACE inhibitor"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Matched placebo; identical tablets to Lisinopril.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Dummy drug"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants enrolled per month","description":"The primary outcome measure is the number of participants enrolled in the study per month.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion fulfilling eligibility criteria","description":"The proportion of suspected acute stroke patients admitted to research sites during the trial duration who fulfilled the study eligibility criteria","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Proportion attended by research trained paramedic","description":"The proportion of study eligible patients attended by a research trained paramedic","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Proportion enrolled by research trained paramedic","description":"The proportion of study eligible patients enrolled into the study by a researc trained paramedic","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Proportion approached but not enrolled","description":"The proportion of study eligible patients approached about the research study but not enrolled, and the reasons for non-enrolment, where possible.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Additional time spent on scene","description":"The additional time spent on scene by research trained paramedics to enrol a participant into the study.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Paramedic compliance","description":"Paramedic compliance with study data collection.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Hospital staff compliance","description":"Hospital staff compliance with study medication administration and data collection.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Proportion completing study medication","description":"The proportion of study participants with confirmed stroke who complete seven days of study medication.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Clinical outcome measures","description":"Clinical outcome measures are blood pressure, neurological score, dependency score and renal function.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Adverse events","description":"Adverse events in control and intervention groups during the study.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults â‰¥ 40 years old\n* New unilateral arm weakness thought to be due to acute stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset\n* Hypertension as defined by systolic BP \\>160mm Hg on two consecutive seated or lying readings taken 5 - 10 minutes apart\n* Conscious (eyes open spontaneously ie \"A\" on Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive (AVPU) scale)\n* Patient being transported to a PIL-FAST trial site (i.e. Royal Victoria Infirmary, North Tyneside General Hospital and Wansbeck General Hospital)\n* Verbal consent obtained from participant or next of kin\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Age \\< 40 years\n* Females who are pregnant, lactating or at risk of pregnancy (i.e. who are not surgically sterile or at least 1 year post last menstrual period).
