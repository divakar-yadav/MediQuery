Its pharmacal ingredients are ginkgo lactones A , ginkgo lactone B, ginkgo lactone K, etc; Excipients for meglumine, citric acid, sodium chloride. It is used to treat stroke (mild-to-moderate cerebral infarction) in recovery phlegm and Syndrome of Intermingled Phlegm and Blood Stasis.\n\nThe aim of this study is to explore the rule of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination after intravenous administration of Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection healthy subjects. The plasma drug profiles will be important to assess the potential clinical drug-drug interactions.\n\nBiological sample including blood and urine for PK is collected during the study. In the first stage, the biological sample of two subjects will be collected at different time points. In the second stage, the biological sample of another two subjects will be collected at the time points which are adjusted according to the results of the first stage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","safety","Pharmacokinetics","Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous drip slowly.
