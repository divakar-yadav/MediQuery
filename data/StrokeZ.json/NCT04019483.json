Large artery occlusions are easy to identify and can be treated with endovascular clot removal. 70% of patient will however suffer from a more distal occlusion resulting in small volume stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Small ischemic lesions are hard to detect with current acute stroke protocols. TIA and small volume stroke patients, are at an increased risk for recurrent stroke, making immediate diagnosis critical. Because thrombo-embolic sources often cause these strokes, identifying and treating the underlying aetiology has the potential to radically lower the risk of recurrence and improve the outcome of these patients.\n\nObjectives: 1) To identify clinical and imaging predictors of recurrent stroke; 2) To improve early detection of small volume stroke with admission computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke with small volume stroke or no ischemia on admission imaging.\n\nStudy design: Prospective, multicenter cohort study.\n\nStudy population: All patients who visited the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC), location Academic Medical Center (AMC) or the St. Antonius Hospital and who underwent a CT-scan of the brain within 9 hours after onset of stroke symptoms with an age ≥18 years. Within 36 months, 720 patients will be enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 300 patients will be included for the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoints are: 1) Stroke recurrence rate at 2 years; 2) Presence and volume of acute ischemic lesions on follow-up diffusion weighted imaging MRI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Recurrence","Infarct detection","CT","MRI","Diagnosis","Prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":720,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"modified Rankin scale","description":"The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.
