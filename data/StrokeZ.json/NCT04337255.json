The MIND diet has the same basic components of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, such as emphasis on natural plant based foods and limited animal and high saturated fat foods, but uniquely specifies green leafy vegetable and berries as well as food component servings that reflect the nutrition dementia evidence. In this study we will test the effects of a 2- to 3-year intervention of the MIND diet (3 months of delivered meals followed by dietary and general stroke health counseling) versus usual post-stroke care (3 months delivered self-selected meals followed by general stroke health counseling) on change on cognitive outcomes over 24 to 36 months. Biological effects of the MIND diet will be assessed by measurement of brain macro and microstructural integrity in 300 trial participants randomly selected participants. Other biochemical markers will be assessed in the entire group of 500 participants including: plasma Abeta42/beta40, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and plasma markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. The trial will examine potential effect mediators and modifiers by a number of cardiovascular risk factors, AD biomarkers and biological mechanisms. The proposed study has 3 recruitment sites, Rush University Medical Center, University of Chicago, and Advocate Christ Hospital all located in Chicago."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Decline","Dementia, Vascular","Alzheimer Disease","Dementia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"MIND diet intervention","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single ( Outcomes assessor)","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MIND DIET intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Allocation and blinding 3 year intervention of MIND Diet + counseling","interventionNames":["Other: Behavioral Dietary intervention ( MIND Diet)"]},{"label":"Usual care diet intervention","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"3 year Intervention of usual care diet + counseling","interventionNames":["Other: Behavioral Usual Care Diet Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Behavioral Dietary intervention ( MIND Diet)","description":"The MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diets but with selected modifications based on the most compelling evidence in the diet dementia field.
