Serum high sensitive CRP is known to be a predictor of cardiovascular events independent of other conventional risk factors. The present substudy examine whether such pleiotrophic effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) which decreases high sensitive CRP would be observed in the post-ischemic stroke patients who have already been registered in the J-STARS, and the relationship the values of high sensitive CRP and recurrence of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","brain ischemia","cerebrovascular accident","statin","hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors","cholesterol","hypercholesterolemia","hyperlipidemia","multicenter studies","prospective studies","endpoint determination","randomized controlled trials","recurrence","pravastatin","c-reactive Protein"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1095,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pravastatin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient has 10mg oral administration of Pravastatin per day.
