Thromboelastometry is a method of analysis of coagulation and fibrinolysis in whole blood. The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the parameters obtained by thromboelastometry are predictive of revascularization at arteriography during mechanical thrombectomy, after treatment with rt-PA thrombolysis.","detailedDescription":"This is a single-center prospective observational study at the University Hospital of Caen. Any patient presenting a neurological deficit of sudden onset, compatible with a ischemic stroke diagnosed on brain imaging and eligible for thrombolysis by rtPA and/or a endovascular thrombectomy procedure will be included. Clot formation kinetics will be assessed by thromboelastometry (ROTEM® and/or QUANTRA®) to determine the predictive parameters of revascularization. The parameters of clot formation and lysis as well as revascularization according to thrombo-inflammation processes will be studied."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke","Thrombolytic Therapy","Mechanical Thrombectomy"],"keywords":["thromboelastometry","ischemic stroke","biomarker","thrombolysis","endovascular thrombectomy","Prediction of revascularization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"sucess of revascularization","description":"group of patients for whom after thrombolysis neurological improvement will be observed and recanalization on imaging will be seen.","interventionNames":["Other: thromboelastometry test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"thromboelastometry test","description":"This study does not modify the usual care of the patient.
