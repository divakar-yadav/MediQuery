Such capacity is limited in pathological conditions, such as in stroke, in which postural control is impaired due to lesions to the central nervous system. Impairment to postural control increases body sway during upright posture and leads to augmented frequency of falls. In this sense, the identification of mechanisms involved in body balance disorders after stroke is particularly important in situations of postural perturbation. The purpose of this project is to evaluate reactive postural responses to unpredictable external perturbations, analyzing postural dysfunctions caused by lesion to different brain areas as a result of stroke, and test principles of dynamic body balance rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Rehabilitation","Sensory System"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory Conditions","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Sensory Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sensory Intervention","description":"1. full sensory information, whose participants will practice balancing tasks without constraint sensory body;\n2. sensory constraint, whose participants will practice the same balance tasks with constraint body of visual and tactile information from the soles of the feet;\n3. control, whose participants will exercise activities involving cognitive and upper limbs.","armGroupLabels":["Sensory Conditions"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Displacement amplitude of the CP to the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral","description":"This outcome measure quantified by the difference between the maximum values of the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral after the start of trial and average position in the axis anteroposterior and mediolateral, respectively, in the 200 ms prior to the onset of the trial.","timeFrame":"2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Coordination between the hip and ankle joint","description":"Coordination between the hip and ankle joints, which is evaluated by adjusting the angle displacement data, hip and ankle angle within 95% of an ellipse surrounding the values of the disturbance moment until the end of the trial.
