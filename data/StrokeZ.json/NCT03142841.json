The investigators will adapt their previously pilot-tested problem-solving intervention and make it culturally-relevant for Hispanic caregivers. The investigators' main goal is to test the efficacy of a brief, telephone and online problem-solving intervention. The objectives are: 1) reduce caregiver burden and depression, 2) improve caregivers' problem-solving abilities, self-efficacy, and quality of life, 3) improve Veterans' functional abilities and determine the intervention's impact on Veterans' healthcare utilization, 4) determine budgetary impact, and 5) determine caregivers' perceptions of the intervention.","detailedDescription":"This research study will test a problem-solving intervention for Spanish-speaking stroke caregivers that will be delivered over the telephone and online via the previously developed and nationally available Spanish version of the RESCUE website.

A sample of 290 stroke caregivers will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or a standard care group. Eligibility criteria: Hispanic caregivers of Veterans with a primary diagnosis of stroke are eligible for participation if they meet the following criteria: 1) are the primary caregiver and provide the majority of care for a Veteran who has a diagnosis of stroke (ICD9 codes for stroke: 430-438 or ICD 10 codes 160.0 through 169.998) within the last year and who has at least two activity of daily living (ADL) deficits or a new or worsening neurological problem, 2) have Internet access and ability, (either themselves or via a relative or friend) 3) are reachable by cell or home phone, 4) Spanish is their preferred language, 5) have moderate to severe stress, and 6) ) identify self as Hispanic, and 7) agree to random assignment to the intervention or standard care group. We will determine caregiver status.\n\nBaseline measurements will be conducted with the caregivers prior to the intervention. Post-test assessments will be collected at 1 and 12 weeks post-intervention. In addition, the investigators will obtain pre- and post-test measures of Veteran-related variables via CPRS electronic health records. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to assess caregivers' perceptions of the intervention. A general linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used to examine the relationship between treatment assignment and each outcome over time. The investigators will measure the budgetary impact of providing intervention by comparing the costs of the intervention group to the costs of the control group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression"],"keywords":["Depression","Burden","Problem Solving Ability","Caregivers","Stroke","Veterans"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A two-arm (8-session intervention vs. standard care), randomized controlled clinical trial with three assessment points will be conducted.
