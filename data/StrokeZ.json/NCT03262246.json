The incidence of the AAC increases strongly with the age and represents a major cause of spontaneous brain haemorrhage to people over 60. The main demonstration is the lobar brain haemorrhage, the other ones are bleedings under arachnoid cortical and microbleedings leading to cognitive decline.\n\nAnatomical studies reported the presence of cortical infarcts in patients having amyloïd deposits suggesting an association between asymptomatic cortical cerebral infarcts and AAC.\n\nHowever prevalence and meaning of these infarcts in patients having an AAC remain badly known because of studies on low number of patients and the rarity of radiological analyses of these infarcts .A better knowledge of these asymptomatic cortical infarcts would allow to dread better cognitive disorders(confusions) presented by these patients, and to develop preventive strategies.\n\nBesides, the risk factors of severity of the AAC are little studied."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Amyloid Angiopathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"medical report consultation","description":"investigators consult medical report concerning patient identified for cerebral amyloid angiopathy"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"number of patient with cerebral infarction and associated factors in a cohort of cerebral amyloid angiopathy patients","timeFrame":"1day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age\\>55\n* hospitalized in CAEN hospital and Paris St Joseph Hospital between 1st january 2011 and 31 december 2015 for cerebral haemorrhage with MRI images diagnosing cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Insufficient MRI images quality without FLAI sequence, T2 GRE\n* disease with same radiologic and clinical signs that cerebral amyloid angiopathy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Investigators select medical report of hospitalized patient between 2011/01/01 and 2015/12/31 in CAEN hospital and Paris St Joseph hospital ; these had an MRI for cerebral haemorrhage.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"HODEL Jérome, Professor","affiliation":"GHPSJ","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph","city":"Paris","state":"Ile-de-France","zip":"75014","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000000686","term":"Amyloidosis"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000057165","term":"Proteostasis Deficiencies"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M3711","name":"Amyloidosis","asFound":"Amyloid","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M28437","name":"Proteostasis Deficiencies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
