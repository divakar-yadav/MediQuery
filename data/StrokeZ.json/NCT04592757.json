In this study a new virtual reality (VR) application will be implemented and tested in two groups of stroke patients (10 acute phase/10 chronic phase). In an attempt to reactivate the affected upper limb in stroke patients, therapists often use mirror therapy. Using a mirror, the movement of a paralyzed limb is feigned in order to reprogram the brain. A patient performs exercises with the healthy limb, but through the mirror the patient seems to use the affected limb. A high number of repetitions is essential to stimulate the so-called neuroplasticity of the brain, but this makes mirror therapy monotonous. In addition, the therapy also has its limitations. Activities are limited by the physical boundaries of the modality, with exercises largely limited to distal movements and simple functional activities. Larger, free-standing mirrors provide a wider range of motion for therapeutic activities, but offer less protection against environmental distraction. With VR, these obstacles can be overcome. By focusing on virtual mirror therapy using a VR headset, therapists hope to create a more pleasant and realistic experience for the patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper extremity","Rehabilitation","Virtual Reality","Immersive technology","Mirror therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Subacute stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Training with new virtual mirror therapy application.
