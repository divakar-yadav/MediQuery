All hand Frenchy assessments will be videotaped for later evaluation by an authorized researcher.\n\nAll participants will undergo the procedure of navigational transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain NBS eXimia Nexstim with the use of an individual 3D brain model created on the Visit 0 MRI results basis.\n\nNeither the patient nor the doctor will know whether they receive an investigational drug or placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrolysin","neuroplasticity","upper limb","middle cerebral artery","NBS","navigation brain stimulation","paretic limb","stroke","ischemic stroke","rehabilitation","Frenchay Arm Test","NBS eXimia Nexstim","Barthel index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cerebrolysin infusion","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cerebrolysin, solution for injection, 10 ml vials.
