A further aim is to examine whether therapy-induced improvements are still maintained over a period of six months. The study's results may lead to more targeted treatment regimens and thus to an enhancement of health-related quality of life in persons with chronic aphasia. The data will further provide evidence-based guidelines of best practice in the rehabilitation of persons with chronic aphasia.\n\nMethods:\n\nFourteen in- and outpatient rehabilitation centres across Germany participate in the study. Via a digital randomization procedure, patients are allocated to one of two groups: an experimental group, starting as soon as feasible with treatment lasting 3 to 6 weeks, and a waiting list control group, whose therapy begins after a three-week delay. Both groups receive a combination of language systematic and communicative-pragmatic language therapy. Everyday language ability will be examined with a standardized outcome measure, and compared between groups at several points: immediately before as well as immediately after and 6 months after completion of (3-6 weeks) intensive language therapy.\n\nStatistical analyses:\n\nThe primary analysis compares the changes in functional communication ability (as indicated by changes of pre- to post-therapy functional communication scores on the primary outcome measure, the ANELT) between the experimental and the waiting list control group in an intention-to-treat (ITT) design. To balance for unequal treatment durations across patient (\"naturalistic treatment setting\"), the critical pre- to post therapy interval is fixed at three weeks, with the option of extension of therapy (provided it is granted by the sickness fund) and re-test after termination of therapy. The long-term stability of potential treatment gains will be re-evaluated 6 months post therapy.\n\nFurther exploratory analyses will examine therapy-induced changes in secondary outcome measures (see below) in the experimental compared to the waiting list control group.\n\nConsidering that age, gender, time post stroke onset, aphasia type (fluent, non-fluent), aphasia severity (based on the Aachen Aphasia Test \\[AAT\\] profile score), the total hours of therapy provided, type of stroke (cortical strokes with or without subcortical involvement), the amount of therapy-concomitant self-administered language practice (e.g. computer-aided practice), and concurrent physio- and neuropsychological therapies might influence functional outcome, the above factors will be included in a multivariate analysis with variable selection. The amount of outpatient therapy provided after discharge from intensive treatment will be statistically controlled by covariate analyses.\n\nFinally, the investigators expect that therapy effects in the waiting list control group will be comparable to those of the experimental group. Thus, after initiation of therapy in the control group after a three-week delay, outcome data will be collected in analogy to the experimental group, and will serve to replicate potential effects of intensive language therapy under routine clinical conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Communication","Language","Treatment","Intervention","Therapy","Efficacy","Maintenance","Recovery","Outcome","Rehabilitation","Treatment Intensity","Language Impairment","Intensive Language Therapy","Functional Communication","Functional Improvement","Evidence-Based Intervention","High-Frequency"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":156,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive aphasia therapy group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group starts intensive integrative aphasia therapy within 3 workdays (or as soon as possible) after baseline exam","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Intensive integrative aphasia therapy"]},{"label":"Waiting list control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Group starts intensive integrative aphasia therapy after a waiting period of at least three weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Waiting list control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Intensive integrative aphasia therapy","description":"Intensive language therapy (3 weeks, 5 days/week, \\>=2 hours/day) provided in regular clinical setting and consisting of a combination of language systematic and communicative-pragmatic treatment","armGroupLabels":["Intensive aphasia therapy group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Waiting list control group","description":"Control group starts intensive language therapy after a 3-week waiting period.","armGroupLabels":["Waiting list control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes on the Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT) - A-scale","description":"Mean gain in ANELT understandability scores (ANELT A-scale; using the parallel versions ANELT-I and ANELT-II)","timeFrame":"Baseline is compared to performance immediately and 6 months post 3 weeks of intensive language therapy.
