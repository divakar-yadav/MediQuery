European and American guidelines recommend the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in most AF patients. The number of patients treated with NOACs has increased significantly during the last few years. In the primary randomized controlled trials leading to their approval, compared to warfarin, NOACs were shown to be either noninferior or superior for stroke prevention in AF, with similar or reduced rates of bleeding, especially intracranial haemorrhage.\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the frequency of oral anticoagulants using, espescially apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, and the predictors of their prescription in a group of hospitalised patients with AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation; Stroke Prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"observational study","description":"observational study"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"oral anticoagulant treatment","timeFrame":"one year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- non-valvular atrial fibrillation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* valvular atrial fibrillation\n* death during hospitalization","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients with AF treated in hospital.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"1st Clinic of Cardiology and Electotherapy","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Kielce","state":"Grunwaldzka 45","zip":"25-637","country":"Poland","contacts":[{"name":"Iwona Gorczyca, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+48 604407956","email":"iwona.gorczyca@interia.pl"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":50.87033,"lon":20.62752}},{"facility":"Iwona Gorczyca","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Kielce","zip":"25-525","country":"Poland","contacts":[{"name":"Iwona Gorczyca, MD,PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+48 604 40 79 56","email":"iwona.gorczyca@interia.pl"},{"name":"Olga Jelonek, MD","role":"CONTACT","email":"olga_jelonek@wp.pl"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":50.87033,"lon":20.62752}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
