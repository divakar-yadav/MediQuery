Expected to enroll 500 patients. The type of high-density lesion is determined according to dual-energy CT images or follow-up images. Patients will be divided into training group, validation and testing groups by stratified random sampling (6:2:2). After the images and the image labels are obtained, deep learning artificial intelligence will be used to learn the image characteristics and establish a diagnostic model, and the model performance and generalization ability will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Hemorrhage","Contrast Media Extravasation","Artificial Intelligence","Mechanical Revascularisation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hemorrhage","description":"The result of the Intracranial hyper-density on CT images is determined by dual-energy CT or follow-up images: hyper-density can be seen on the virtual non-contrasted image of dual-energy CT, or high density persist longer than 48 hours."},{"label":"simple contrast extravasation","description":"There is no Intracranial hyper-density on the virtual non-contrast images of dual-energy CT, or the follow-up CT show that the hyper-density is absorbed within 48 hours."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Develop a deep learning model to differentiate brain hemorrhage from contrast agent extravasation, and evaluate the model performance and generalization ability","description":"The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall of the model will be calculated, and confusion matrix will be display.","timeFrame":"2024-12"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n(1) patients underwent non-enhanced head CT after mechanical vascularization; (2) initial post-operative non-enhanced head CT was performed within 24 h after mechanical vascularization; and (3) intracranial hyper-intensity, which was defined as an objectively higher density than the surrounding grey or white matter in the parenchyma or higher density than cerebrospinal fluid in ventricles and cisterns, could be seen on the initial non-enhanced head CT after mechanical vascularization.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n(1) the follow-up time of non-enhanced head CT after mechanical vascularization was less than 24 h; (2) artifacts (e.g. metal artifacts or motion artifacts) affected the hyper-intensity in CT images; and (3) patients underwent craniotomy after mechanical vascularization, which made it difficult to identify the area of hyper-intensity.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"From December 2017 to June 2023, patients with acute ischemic stroke or intracranial arterial stenosis who underwent mechanical vascularization at 10 centers will be retrospectively enrolled.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Meiwei Chen","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86 18898534109","email":"chenmw7@mail.sysu.edu.cn"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000020300","term":"Intracranial Hemorrhages"},{"id":"D000006470","term":"Hemorrhage"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9246","name":"Hemorrhage","asFound":"Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21803","name":"Intracranial Hemorrhages","asFound":"Brain Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
