Patients, partners and the coupleÂ´s adult children who are at least 18 years old, are all invited to ultrasound examinations due to a standardized protocol.\n\nParents of patients and partners are invited to return their answers of standardized questionnaires about clinical ischemic events such as stroke, angina or myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease.\n\nStudy inclusion time of patients and their families is 5 years. A biobank is build from samples from patients, partners and adult children. Clinical follow-ups for patients and partners are planned after 5, 10 and 15 years. Clinical follow-ups for adult children are planned after 10 and 20 years.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nWhat do patients know about their parents clinical ischemic events? How much established pathology in arteries do we find by a standardized ultrasound protocol at the time of ischemic stroke at a young age? Differences concerning risk factors and ultrasound findings between patients and partners? Differences between children from families with several ischemic events among parents and grandparents vs. children from families without ischemic events? Biochemical markers related to ultrasound findings and artery disease.","detailedDescription":"Equal examinations for patients, partners and adult children are:\n\n* Standardized questionnaires\n* Extracranial duplexsonography\n* Duplexsonography of the abdominal aorta\n* Duplexsonography of femoral arteries\n* Duplexsonography of epicardial, intrabdominal and subcutaneous fat\n* Peripheral ultrasound, Ankle-arm index\n* ECG\n* Blood pressure measurement\n* BMI and Waist-hip ratio\n* Blood samples"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Death","Carotid Artery Disease","Cardiovascular Disease","Peripheral Artery Disease"],"keywords":["Young ischemic stroke","Families","Long-term follow-up"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1062,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lifestyle counseling","type":"OTHER","description":"There are no different arms, NOR-SYS is an observational study","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Lifestyle counseling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Lifestyle counseling","description":"Ultrasound examinations of carotid arteries, aorta abdominalis, femoral arteries and lifestyle counseling","armGroupLabels":["Lifestyle counseling"],"otherNames":["NOR-SYS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"All cause mortality","description":"Outcome measure is assessed every five years.","timeFrame":"20 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Arterial events (recurrent stroke or transitory ischemic attack, myocardial infarction or angina, peripheral artery disease","description":"Outcome measure is assessed every five years.","timeFrame":"20 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Documented ischemic stroke at age from 15 up to 60 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke as end-of-life event among patients with cancer or other life-threatening disease\n* Stroke caused by trauma","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"15 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ulrike Waje-Andreassen, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Haukeland UH","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Dep. of Neurology","city":"Bergen","zip":"5053","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":60.39299,"lon":5.32415}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29334265","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Oftedal A, Gerdts E, Waje-Andreassen U, Fromm A, Naess H, Linde A, Saeed S.
