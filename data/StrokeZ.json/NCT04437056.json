Upper limb spasticity is one of them. Nevertheless, not all the muscles are equally affected, as some may turn spastic or paretic and other remain intact. This unique pathophysiological mosaic dictates a precise therapeutic plan. Existing spasticity treatment has significant drawbacks due to its unspecific targeting and short duration. A causal, life-lasting treatment, precisely adapted to every single patient's needs and to disease pattern, is currently missing. Hyperselective muscle denervation and subsequent cognitive reinnervation with appropriate unaffected donor nerves may break the pathological spastic circuit and provide volitional muscle control. With this pioneering study we will perform cognitive nerve transfers to spastic muscles and will prospectively investigate their effects on clinical, electrophysiological, molecular-biological and histological level. Accurate donor nerve selection will be for the first time quantified through motor unit number estimation with high-density needle electromyography. This revolutionary concept can open the window to a new era of therapeutic possibilities for stroke victims."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke","Nerve Transfers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients with upper limb spasticity","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity will be operated for cognitive nerve transfers to spastic muscles to allow for volitional muscle reinnervation and disrupture of spasticity.
