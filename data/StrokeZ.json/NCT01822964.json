From start of anesthesia, until final valve implantation, local cooling (by the RhinoChill device) will be applied to the brain. Effect of cooling on cerebral oxygenation, by cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring (NIRS ForeSight technology) during the TAVI procedure will be continuously assessed during native valve manipulation and during final valve deployment (=primary endpoint of he study). As secondary endpoints, neuropsychological testing performed before and after TAVI procedure will assess the effects of the use of cooling during the TAVI procedure. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100-beta will be analyzed during and up to 72hrs after TAVI to compare the cerebral ischemic damage between cooled and non-cooled patients. And finally, diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain will be performed 5 days before and 5-7 days after TAVI to compare the number and total amount of cerebral ischemic insults between cooled and non-cooled patients. The hypothesis behind this study is that by local cooling of the brain during manipulation of the calcified aorta and aortic valve, the brain might be protected from cerebral ischemic insults."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Stenosis","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"targeted brain cooling","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In these 15 pts, targeted brain cooling (tympanic temperature of 33°C) will be applied during the TAVI intervention by the use of the RhinoChill device (Benechill Inc, San Diego cA)","interventionNames":["Device: targeted brain cooling (33°C) by RhinoChill device"]},{"label":"no use of targeted brain cooling","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"In these 15 pts, no cooling techniques will be applied and current clinical practice as to maintenance of normothermia will be followed during these TAVI interventions","interventionNames":["Device: Placebo - current clinical practice, no cooling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"targeted brain cooling (33°C) by RhinoChill device","description":"targeted brain cooling by Rhinochill device to 33°C tympanic temperature during TAVI procedure.
