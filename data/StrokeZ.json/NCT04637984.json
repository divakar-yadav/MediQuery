The recovery of motor function is crucial for the patient to regain independence and quality of life. Identifying early predictors of motor recovery and outcomes is useful for planning personalized rehabilitation programs and increasing their efficiency. However, making predictions using a single clinical assessment is often difficult and a combination of multiple tools is required. In the last decades, were validated two predictive algorithms for upper limb function and independent walking that can be easily implemented into clinical practice with the aim of increasing knowledge on expected outcome after stroke in patients, families and rehabilitation teams. This will be the first single-site randomized control trial that will test the implementation of such tools in a rehabilitation setting in Italy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["rehabilitation efficiency","PRESTO algorithms","physical rehabilitation","stroke","motion kinematics","brain activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Implementation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Predictions will be provided to the rehabilitation team and discussed with the patient and their family.
