Indeed, it can occur in up to 10 to 30% of cases and, therefore, is associated with a very poor prognosis. These refractory occlusions frequently occur when an underlying intracranial atherosclerotic disease is present. Thus, one of the most promising rescue technique consists of placing a permanent intracranial stent, under dual antiplatelet therapy over the target refractory occlusion. This strategy is well studied in coronary occlusions where the atheroscotic mechanism is highly prevalent. However, as the ischemiated brain is at much higher risk of hemorrhagic complications, such strategy entails a greater risk. This raises the question of whether such risk is worth the reward of obtaining reperfusion. The investigators designed this randomized study in order to evaluate whether a strategy combining rescue pemanent intracranial stenting with the best medical treatment is superior to the best medical treatment alone in acute refractory large vessel occlusions.","detailedDescription":"These past recent years, mechanichal thrombectomy has become the standard treatment for acute ischemic strokes due to large vessel occlusions. Mechanical thrombectomy failure occurs in about 10 to 30% of cases with disastrous consequences for these patients. Indeed, reperfusion failures are associated with 30.5% mortality rates and only 21% of all patients are able to achieve functional independence at 3 months.\n\nIn order to treat these refractory large vessel occlusions many techniques and devices have been developped. Rescue Intracranial Stenting (RIS) is the most studied technique and the most promising one. However, RIS requires strong antithrombotic medications to ensure stent patency, which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.\n\nThe investigators recently performed a meta-analysis of observational data, that showed that RIS in refractory large vessel occlusions allowed significant improvements in functional outcome at 3 months. The rate of good functional outcome at 3 months went from 21% in the control group (no RIS) to 43% in the RIS group. Mortality was also significantly reduced from 30.5% (control group) to 18.8% in the RIS group. Furthermore, RIS did not increase the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nOf course, this meta-analysis is only based on observational data and needs to be confirmed in a randomized trial to bring the highest level of evidence.\n\nRefractory large vessel occlusions are commonly caused by an underlying intracranial atherosclerotic plaque. Since the SAMMPRIS trial, most of the indications for the endovascular treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses have been removed. Nevertheless, there are subsets of patients who actually benefit from intracranial stenting such as patients with refractory large vessel occlusions or patients with hemodynamically significant stenoses. As such, the PISTAR trial could be a way of validating intracranial stenting in this indication.\n\nAll patients admitted for a mechanical thrombectomy will be screened before the procedure. If the patient fulfills the preoperative elligibility criteria, she/he will be informed of the possibility of being included in case of a refractory occlusion. If the patients' clinical state does not allow her/him to give informed consent, she/he can still be included using an emergency consent procedure. Consents to pursue the study will be sought as soon as possible, from the patient or her/his trusted relative.\n\nIf the patient meets all remaining elligibility criteria during the mechanical thrombectomy in particular if the occlusion is considered as refractory, she/he can be included and randomized.\n\nRandomization will be performed using a minimization procedure based on the recruiting center, the administration of IV thrombolysis and the location of the occlusion (anterior versus posterior circulation). The randomzation will be centralized using an online e-crf platform.\n\nThe patient can be randomized in one of the two following arms\n\n* Intervention arm : RIS + best medical treatment In this arm, a dedicated antithrombotic protocol will be initiated before the deployment of the stent. The choice of antithrombotics and the need to perform additional endovascular manœuvres such as balloon angioplasty will be left at the operator's discretion. A standard protocol for antithrombotics is proposed.\n* Control arm : best medical treatment with no additional thrombectomy passes In this arm, the procedure is stopped and a last control angiogram is performed to confirm the absence of reperfusion. Any additional medical treatment is allowed.\n\nFollow up visits will be performed immediately after the procedure (V0), at 24hrs (V1), 72hs (V2) and 1 month (V3). The end-research visit will be performed at 3 months (+/- 15 days) and a remote safety visit will be performed at 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Brain","Intracranial","Ischemia","Stroke","Mechanical Thrombectomy","Intracranial Occlusion","Refractory Occlusion","Interventional","Angioplasty","Stenting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":346,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intracranial stenting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Rescue Intracranial Stenting + best medical treatment","interventionNames":["Device: Intracranial stenting"]},{"label":"Best medical management alone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Best medical treatment with no additional thrombectomy passes","interventionNames":["Other: Optimal medical care, without additional endovascular procedures"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intracranial stenting","description":"In order to promote the efficacy of the stent to reopen the target vessel, there are two requirments prior stenting: First, balloon angioplasty can be performed at operators' discretion based on angiographic findings.
