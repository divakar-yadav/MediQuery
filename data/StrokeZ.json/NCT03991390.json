The total sample (N=16) will randomized into two groups: treatment vs. control. All of them suffering from subacute stroke and pusher syndrome.\n\nThe study intervention will last 4 weeks. The control group will receive usual rehabilitation treatment for patients with stroke and pusher syndrome (60 minutes per day/5 days per week). The intervention group will receive usual rehabilitation treatment for patients with stroke and pusher syndrome (30 minutes per day/5 days per week) plus 30 minutes of therapy based on the specific protocol designed for the study. This protocol will consist of Core Stability exercises and visual feedback with lasers, both procedures will be alternated one day each.\n\nThe evaluation of the intervention program will be based on the established objectives, assessing: 1) Pushing Intensity (controversial push scale (SCP)), 2) Laterality (Burke Scale (BLS)), 3) Balance (Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (S-PASS)), 4) patient functional capacity (Barthel Index), and 5) Quality of Life (Newcastle Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Measure (NEWSQOL)). These variables will be evaluated baseline and post-intervention. Additionally, SCP, BLS and S-PASS will be assessed 15 days after starting treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pusher Syndrome","Subacute Stroke"],"keywords":["Pusher syndrome","Core stability","Visual feedback","Postural control","Balance","Rehabilitation stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Core stability and feedback visual laser exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Two complementary protocols for the treatment of balance after stroke in patients with pusher syndrome were designed, including multidimensional physiotherapy exercises.

The patient will be tilted 30º to the affected side and will be asked to return to the vertical position, according to the degrees where resistance appears will be given a score (0 there is no resistance, 1 resistance that begins at 5º, 2 the resistance begins at 10º, 3 the resistance begins above 10º) and the examiner will score if it is (0-null,1-light, 2-moderate, 3-severe) and the same will be evaluated when standing.\n\nInterobserver reliability has been shown to be effective for therapy.","timeFrame":"Baseline (admission), 15 days, 30 days"},{"measure":"Change of Balance at 30 days","description":"The S-PASS scale has been validated for post-stroke patients in Spanish.
