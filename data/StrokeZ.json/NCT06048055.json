The main question is:\n\nâ€¢Is there a significant effect of non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation on upper limb motor function in stroke patients? Participants will be assigned into two groups. They will receive 12 sessions of true or sham transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation for 30 minutes immediately followed by 30 minutes of selected physical therapy program, three sessions per week for four weeks.","detailedDescription":"Stroke causes several neurological deficits or impairments as hemiparesis, communication disorders, cognitive deficits or disorders in visuo-spatial perception. Approximately 60% of survivors after stroke suffer from upper limb motor impairment, which lead to loss of independence with poor quality of life. These global economic and social costs of chronic disability due to stroke necessitate the development of new methods beside the conventional treatment to induce neuroplasticity in stroke recovery.Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation therapy, which sends impulses into the neural center to generate corresponding nervous activity. Vagus nerve stimulation is an established treatment in epilepsy, depression, chronic tinnitus, migraine and chronic pain.Vagus nerve stimulation can be invasive or non-invasive. Invasive VNS requires the implantation of a programmable device and electrodes that directly stimulate afferents of the vagus nerve under general anesthesia. Non-invasive method of VNS via transcutaneous stimulation of the peripheral auricular branch of the vagus nerve (taVNS) is safer, better-tolerated method for delivering VNS with the same effect of invasive VNS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["vagus nerve stimulation","ischemic stroke","taVNS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1 (GA)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Twenty Egyptian male stroke patients will receive 30 minutes of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation at tragus of left ear immediately after a 30 minutes session of selected physical therapy program.","interventionNames":["Other: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation","Other: selected physical therapy program"]},{"label":"Group 2 (GB)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Twenty Egyptian male stroke patients will receive 30 minutes of sham vagal nerve stimulation at tragus of left ear immediately after a 30 minutes session of selected physical therapy program.","interventionNames":["Other: selected physical therapy program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation","description":"Patients in this group will be treated with 12 sessions of transcutaneous auricular nerve stimulation, three sessions per week for four weeks. The stimulation of the left auricular branch of the vagus nerve will be performed by conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) through a Gamna Duo 200 electrotherapy device with one channel and two electrodes (5mm diameter disposable adhesive stimulation electrodes). The TENS parameters will be used: 30 30-minute treatment time, a pulse width of 200 milliseconds, and a pulse frequency of 20 hertz. The intensity of stimulation will be individually adjusted according to the patient's perceptual threshold. The perceptual threshold (PT) is defined as the minimum amount of electricity required to perceive electrical stimulation on the skin described as a pricking or tingling sensation. The stimulation intensity will be set at super-threshold levels, such as 200% of the patient's perceptual threshold.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1 (GA)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"selected physical therapy program","description":"The selected physical therapy program session will be from 25 to 30 minutes, three sessions per week for four weeks.
