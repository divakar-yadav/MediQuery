Stroke is a complex disease with multiple interacting risk factors (including genetic, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and lifestyle factors like smoking, diet, and exercise) that lead to initial and recurrent stroke. Up to 90% of stroke survivors have some functional deficit that impacts both physical and mental health.\n\nScientific evidence that identifies the best stroke care delivery design is lacking. We completed a three-year, Centers for Medicare \\& Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Care Innovation Award that tested a new stroke care design called an Integrated Practice Unit (IPU). This IPU was developed through stakeholder input from patients, caregivers, nurses, stroke specialists, rehabilitation specialists, patient advocacy groups, payers, and technology companies. This IPU design was associated with decreased hospital length of stay, readmissions, and stroke recurrence, as well as lower cost.\n\nBased on the CMS study, a larger, pragmatic trial was developed that is called C3FIT (Coordinated, Collaborative, Comprehensive, Family-based, Integrated, and Technology-enabled Stroke Care). C3FIT will randomly assign 18 US hospital sites to continue Joint Commission-certified Comprehensive/Primary (CSC/PSC) design or to the novel Integrated Stroke Practice Unit (ISPU) design for stroke care. C3FIT's ISPU uses team-based, enhanced collaboration (called Stroke Central) and follows patients from presentation at the Emergency Department (ED) through 12-months post-discharge (called Stroke Mobile). Stroke Mobile includes a nurse and lay health educator team who visit patients and caregivers at home or at a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility to assess function and quality of life using telehealth technology to facilitate access to multiple providers. Results from C3FIT will provide high quality scientific evidence to determine the best stroke care design that ensures positive health for patients and caregivers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Acute","Stroke Sequelae","Engagement, Patient","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Technology-enabled","Engagement, caregiver","Team-based","Integrated Care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pragmatic randomized trial of approximately 18 clinical sites in the United States; randomization is by clinical site.","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Primary outcomes will be assessed by telephone at 3, 6, and 12 months by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)'s Survey Research Unit (SRU).
