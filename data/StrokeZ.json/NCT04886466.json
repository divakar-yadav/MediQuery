Measurements were made during two different motor tasks: trunk tilts without and with the tension of the abdominal muscles in the sitting position and walking in a place with high knee lifting. It was checked how the intervention (active tension of the muscles stabilizing the core) changes the parameters of the motor coordination of the trunk and lower limbs.","detailedDescription":"Surface electrodes (single-use 55 and 40 mm; ECG Electrodes; Sorimex, Poland) were glued to the subject's body according to the SENIAM (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles) procedure for the transverse abdominal, multifidus, and supraspinal muscles, and a laser rangefinder was attached to the dorsal side at chest height. Before each exercise, the subject was instructed on how the exercise should be done.\n\nThe examination involved two motor exercises. In the first one, the subject was seated on the therapeutic table (with their upper extremities crossed over their chest) and instructed to lean forward as far as possible (ideally to place their torso on their thighs) and then quickly return to their starting position. The movement was repeated three times. Then the subject performed three more repetitions of the movement with their core engaged (i.e., their abdominal muscles contracted or \"stabilized\"). The range of trunk inclination in the sagittal plane (mm) and in the frontal plane (m), and the reaction of the multifidus, transverse abdominal, and supraspinatus muscles (tension values reported in microvolts \\[µV\\]) were measured using a millimeter board, laser pointer, rangefinder (measurement/angle of inclination accuracy of ± 1.5 mm), electrode, and a device for measuring the voltage of selected muscle groups, Luna EMG (accuracy of measurement \\[-1-+1V+/-1mV\\]).\n\nThe second exercise was a march-in-place with a high elevation of the knees. This exercise was also done as quickly as possible (time measured for 20 steps in place in seconds \\[s\\]). The exercise was done in duplicate. On the second occasion, subjects were instructed to do the exercise with their core engaged (i.e., their abdominal muscles contracted or \"stabilized\"). The exercise was performed in duplicate. The duration of the march and the elevation of the feet were measured, as well as the activity of the multifidus, transverse abdominal, and supraspinatus muscles."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","core stability","muscle tone","motor coordination"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The trunk movement coordinated and legs coordination during walking in place.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention (active tension of the muscles stabilizing the core) was tested in post-stroke patients (study group).","interventionNames":["Procedure: core stability in a sitting position and while walking in one place"]},{"label":"The coordinated movement of the trunk and legs during fast walking in place.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention (active tension of the muscles stabilizing the core) was tested in patients with back pain syndrome, but without neurological deficits (control group).","interventionNames":["Procedure: core stability in a sitting position and while walking in one place"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"core stability in a sitting position and while walking in one place","description":"The intervention consisted of checking how the active tension of the multisection and transverse abdominal muscles affects the pattern of the trunk movement (in the sitting position) and the work of the lower limbs and the speed of movement while walking in a place.","armGroupLabels":["The coordinated movement of the trunk and legs during fast walking in place.","The trunk movement coordinated and legs coordination during walking in place."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Range of active movement of the trunk in frontal plane.","description":"The range of trunk inclination in the frontal plane (m) was measured using a millimeter board, laser pointer, rangefinder (measurement/angle of inclination accuracy of ± 1.5 mm).","timeFrame":"up to 1 week"},{"measure":"Range of active movement of the trunk in sagittal plane.","description":"The range of trunk inclination in the sagittal plane (mm) was measured using a millimeter board, laser pointer, rangefinder (measurement/angle of inclination accuracy of ± 1.5 mm).","timeFrame":"up to 1 week"},{"measure":"The duration of the march-in-place","description":"Time measured for 20 steps using the stopwatch","timeFrame":"up to 1 week"},{"measure":"Elevation of the feet","description":"The elevation of the feet were measured using the laser pointer, rangefinder (measurement/angle of inclination accuracy of ± 1.5 mm).","timeFrame":"up to 1 week"},{"measure":"The reaction of the multifidus, transverse abdominal, and supraspinatus muscles.","description":"The reaction of muscles (tension values reported in microvolts \\[µV\\]) was measured using an electrode, and a device for measuring the voltage of selected muscle groups, Luna EMG (accuracy of measurement \\[-1-+1V+/-1mV\\]).","timeFrame":"up to 1 week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Main criteria for stroke group inclusion: 1) patients with ischemic stroke;
