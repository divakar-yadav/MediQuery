Current hand rehabilitation robotic devices are typically driven by rigid linkages/joints, which subject the fingers into a single plane of motion that is unnatural and uncomfortable. These devices belong to the class of continuous passive motion (CPM) devices that only promote hand range-of-motion, but do not require the patient to play an active role in performing the hand exercises. There is a strong need for a device that can resolve the lack of compliant robot-assisted hand motion and lack of intuitive user control in assistive and rehabilitation processes.\n\nThis proposed research aims to fill the above-mentioned gaps for current hand rehabilitation devices by developing a soft robotic glove that provides compliant assistance to bidirectional hand motion, coupled with intuitive user control.\n\nIn the short term, the robotic glove will likely enhance the patients' hand flexion-extension range of motion and improve the neuro-motor control of the hand.\n\nIn the long term, the robotic glove will act as an adjunct to therapists, thereby raising productivity in the presence of growing manpower constraints and optimizing therapy time for the patients; this can potentially enhance recovery time and quality of life, as a result of improved hand mobility for common daily tasks.","detailedDescription":"The investigators aim to develop a new bidirectional composite soft actuator that is capable of assisting in both hand flexion and extension. This new class of actuator will comprise of a flexion actuator component with its external bending patterns and dedicated pneumatic channel, and an embedded extension actuator component with its dedicated air-flow inlet. When pressurized air is introduced through the extension inlet, the extension actuator will inflate and stiffen, thereby assisting in hand extension. Moreover, when pressurized air is introduced through the flexion inlet, the flexion actuator will inflate and bend, thereby assisting in hand flexion.\n\nThese bidirectional actuators will be embedded onto each finger segment of a fabric glove, and air inflow into each of the bidirectional actuators can be controlled via a pump-valve control system. The pump-valve control system comprises a microcontroller, onboard power source, transceiver, motor pump, and flexion and extension control valves. Once the microcontroller receives a command signal to adopt a specific hand posture, it will send the postural command to the motor pump and the necessary flexion/extension control valves, thereby actuating the corresponding bidirectional soft actuators to assist the user's hand into the desired hand posture.\n\nAims:\n\nAim 1: The bidirectional myoelectric soft robotic glove may provide intuitive user-controlled robot-assisted hand grasping postures to the human user for achieving functional tasks. With the help of the glove system, participants may be more capable of achieving active daily living tasks.\n\nAim 2: The bidirectional myoelectric soft robotic glove may provide intuitive user-controlled robot-assisted hand grasping postures to the human user for rehabilitation purposes.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe central hypothesis is that a bidirectional myoelectric soft robotic glove will provide intuitive user-controlled robot-assisted hand grasping postures to the human user for achieving functional tasks more than no robot assistance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Soft Robotic Glove","Electromyography","Hand Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EMG Glove Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A total of 12 sessions of robot-assisted hand training for 6 consecutive weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: Robot-Assisted Hand Training"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A total of 12 session of standard hand therapy sessions in 6 consecutive weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard Hand Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot-Assisted Hand Training","description":"Perform activities of daily living, e.g., write sentences, turn cards, move small and big objects, simulated feeding, stack checkers, pour water, squeeze handles","armGroupLabels":["EMG Glove Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard Hand Therapy","description":"Stretching, Strengthening, Hand Functional Training","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Assessment","description":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) Upper Extremity (UE) Score, A total of 66 scores.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline FMA score at 6 weeks."},{"measure":"Functional Assessment","description":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), A total of 57 scores.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline ARAT score at 6 weeks."},{"measure":"Brain Imaging","description":"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline Imaging at 6 weeks."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
