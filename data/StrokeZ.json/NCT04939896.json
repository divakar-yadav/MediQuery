To recruit first-onset stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation and collect the general data. Telephone follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after the onset. Based on the biological-psychosocial medical model and literature, biological, psychological and sociological factors were screened. The patient rehabilitation adherence level in different periods was measured. Latent Growth Mixture Model (LGMM) was used to investigate the general trend of rehabilitation compliance in patients with first-episode stroke within 6 months. Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) method in Latent Growth hybrid model was used to identify the track of heterogeneous change. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the predictors of different subgroups of change trajectories relative to other subgroups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","stroke","medical adherence","trajectory"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Compliance with rehabilitation","description":"The patients' compliance with rehabilitation was followed up at 2, 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks after onset, respectively","interventionNames":["Other: observation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"observation","description":"Observed patients' compliance with rehabilitation at different time","armGroupLabels":["Compliance with rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Functional Exercise Compliance Scale for Stroke Patients","description":"The full score is 56 points, and the higher the cumulative score of each item, the higher the level of compliance.","timeFrame":"Week 2"},{"measure":"Motor Functional Exercise Compliance Scale for Stroke Patients","description":"The full score is 56 points, and the higher the cumulative score of each item, the higher the level of compliance.","timeFrame":"Week 6"},{"measure":"Motor Functional Exercise Compliance Scale for Stroke Patients","description":"The full score is 56 points, and the higher the cumulative score of each item, the higher the level of compliance.","timeFrame":"Week 8"},{"measure":"Motor Functional Exercise Compliance Scale for Stroke Patients","description":"The full score is 56 points, and the higher the cumulative score of each item, the higher the level of compliance.","timeFrame":"Week 12"},{"measure":"Motor Functional Exercise Compliance Scale for Stroke Patients","description":"The full score is 56 points, and the higher the cumulative score of each item, the higher the level of compliance.","timeFrame":"Week 24"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients diagnosed with stroke by CT or MR;\n\n  * Patients with first onset (within 14 days of onset);
