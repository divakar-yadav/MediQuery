The proposed study will evaluate the application of the CARE-CITE intervention paired with usual and customary care during the sub-acute stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States, and has a particularly harmful impact on individuals and families. Approximately 4.8 million stroke survivors require assistance from family members who are often untrained and ill prepared for the burdens associated with stroke rehabilitation. Family carepartners are key contributors to stroke recovery, but their efforts can lead them to experience a high level of burden and depressive symptoms, reduced quality of life and increased stress in the context of high levels of family conflict surrounding the recovery process. Rehabilitation therapy interventions have primarily targeted stroke survivor outcomes without specifically addressing the well-being of the carepartner.\n\nThe researchers of this study have developed a theory-based, family-centered intervention, Carepartner and Collaborative Integrated Therapy (CARE-CITE), designed to engage carepartners during stroke survivor upper extremity (UE) functional task practice in the home. Residual UE impairments occur in up to 80% of stroke survivors and are a primary factor in loss of functional independence. CARE-CITE guides the carepartner in collaborative goal setting and providing autonomy support (characterized by empathy, choice and reducing use of controlling language) for the stroke survivor to promote motivation and creative problem solving in UE self-management.\n\nParticipating stroke survivor and carepartner dyads will be randomized to receive the CARE-CITE intervention with usual customary care, or usual customary care alone for four weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Telehealth","Rehabilitation","Care partner","Sub-acute stroke","CARE-CITE","Stroke survivors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CARE-CITE Carepartner","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This study arm consists of carepartners receiving the CARE-CITE intervention.
