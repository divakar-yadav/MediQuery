The objectives will be 1) to determine the natural history of dysphagia screening skill decay, and 2) to assess the benefit of independent web-based practice and periodic feedback on screening skill maintenance. We will enrol a convenience sample of nurses who currently work with stroke patients but who have had no prior formal training with dysphagia screening.\n\nThe study will consist of 2 phases: A) an initial pilot phase followed by B) a prospective randomized controlled study. During Phase A, three new web-based, self-instructed skill refresher courses will be developed to help nurses maintain the skills they will learn in an 8-hour workshop on dysphagia screening. During Phase B, nurses will receive the 8-hour workshop and one-on-one evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Following training, competent screeners will be randomized into one of two groups: Group A - Control group with no refresher course or periodic feedback from SLP; Group B - Web-based skill refresher courses only. Nurses will be evaluated at several timepoints throughout Phase B to assess theoretical dysphagia screening knowledge and skills."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Deglutition Disorders","Dysphagia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Skill Maintenance","Skill Decay","Screening"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":96,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A Nurses","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants receive neither web-based refresher courses nor periodic feedback by SLP"},{"label":"Group B Nurses","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive web-based skill refresher courses but no periodic feedback by SLP","interventionNames":["Other: TOR-BSST© Refresher Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"TOR-BSST© Refresher Training","description":"Web-based refresher training in dysphagia screening","armGroupLabels":["Group B Nurses"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Skill decay over time among nurses trained to use the TOR-BSST© to screen for dysphagia in stroke patients","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Nurses who care for acute stroke patients","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Rosemary Martino, MA, MSc, PhD","affiliation":"University of Toronto, Dept. of Speech Language Pathology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital","city":"Binghamton","state":"New York","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.09869,"lon":-75.91797}},{"facility":"Foothills Hospital","city":"Calgary","state":"Alberta","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05011,"lon":-114.08529}},{"facility":"Alberta Health Services - Capital Health (University of Alberta Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital)","city":"Edmonton","state":"Alberta","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":53.55014,"lon":-113.46871}},{"facility":"Georgian Bay General Hospital","city":"Penetanguishene/Midland","state":"Ontario","country":"Canada"},{"facility":"University Health Network - Toronto Western Hospital","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M5T 2S8","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"16269630","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Martino R, Foley N, Bhogal S, Diamant N, Speechley M, Teasell R.
