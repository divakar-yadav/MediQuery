Increasing evidence can be found supporting stimulation of the afferent receptor enhances neuroplasticity in the brain. Studies have suggested multisensory stimulation could promote motor learning by re-establishing the disrupted sensorimotor loop due to stroke and enhance neuroplasticity.\n\nThe objective of the study was to examine the effect of multisensory stimulation on upper-extremity motor recovery and self-care function in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Stroke patients referred to occupational therapy division of geriatric day hospital will be recruited and randomly assigned to a multisensory therapy group or a conventional training group. The Multisensory therapy group received 12 weeks (two sessions/ week; 90 minutes/session) training. Each session began with 15 minutes of sensory stimulation (cold and vibration), 45 minutes of motor training and 30 minutes of self-care training. The conventional training group included 12 weeks (two sessions/ week; 90 minutes/session) training. Each session included 60 minutes of upper extremity motor practice and 30 minutes of self-care training.\n\nOutcome measures included: Brunnstrom's stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale and Functional Test for the Hemiplegic Upper Extremity were used for upper limb motor control and function; and Manual muscle testing was used for muscle strength. The modified Barthel Index was used for self-care performance"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Multisensory stimulation; motor recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This was a quasi-randomized-controlled pilot.
