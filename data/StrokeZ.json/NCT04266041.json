Participants will be asked wear a cap with electrodes attached to it. During the recording, participants may be asked to rest, sleep, or complete a task. The tasks involve viewing pictures, answering questions, speaking, or moving an arm or leg. Recordings generally last between 60-120 minutes.\\*"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Epilepsy","Tumor","Healthy"],"keywords":["Electroencephalogram (EEG)","Epilepsy","Lesion","Brain","Language","Movement","Sensation","Mapping","Dense-array EEG","High-density EEG","HD-EEG","stroke","Electrical Impedance Tomography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-density EEG localization in epilepsy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-density EEG will be used for brain localization in epilepsy patients","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG)"]},{"label":"High-density EEG localization in healthy controls","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"High-density EEG will be used for brain localization in healthy controls","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG)"]},{"label":"High-density EEG localization in tumor patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-density EEG will be used for brain localization in tumor patients","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG)"]},{"label":"High-density EEG localization in peripheral nerve patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-density EEG will be used for brain localization in patients with peripheral nerve dysfunction","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG)"]},{"label":"High-density EEG localization in stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-density EEG will be used for brain localization in patients who have recently experienced a stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: High-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"High-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG)","description":"This study will focus on obtaining a special type of high-density scalp electroencephalography (HD-EEG) recordings in patients with neurological disorders (i.e., epilepsy, brain tumor, stroke, etc.) and appropriately matched controls. HD-EEG is a scalp EEG which uses up to 256 channels compared to the standard 21 channels used for routine clinical applications. The reason for using more channels to record is for more precise localization of epileptogenic foci and/or more precise mapping of brain functions. This type of EEG requires the use of patient's own MRI scan to precisely localize activity. Therefore, all patients and controls getting an HD-EEG will require a structural MRI scan.","armGroupLabels":["High-density EEG localization in epilepsy","High-density EEG localization in healthy controls","High-density EEG localization in peripheral nerve patients","High-density EEG localization in stroke patients","High-density EEG localization in tumor patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Localize brain functions in patients and healthy controls","description":"Localize brain functions using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Localize brain areas involved in language","description":"Localize brain areas involved in language using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"},{"measure":"Localize brain areas involved in movement","description":"Localize brain areas involved in movement using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"},{"measure":"Localize brain areas involved in sensation","description":"Localize brain areas involved in sensation using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"},{"measure":"Localize brain areas involved in emotion","description":"Localize brain areas involved in emotion using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"},{"measure":"Localize brain areas involved in memory","description":"Localize brain areas involved in memory using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"},{"measure":"Localize brain areas associated with lesions","description":"Localize brain areas associated with lesions using high-density EEG recordings","timeFrame":"60 - 90 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Able to perform the tasks\n* Able to give own consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis such as stroke, tumor, or psychosis judged to interfere with high-density EEG.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center","city":"Lebanon","state":"New Hampshire","zip":"03756","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":43.64229,"lon":-72.25176}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000004827","term":"Epilepsy"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7673","name":"Epilepsy","asFound":"Epilepsy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
