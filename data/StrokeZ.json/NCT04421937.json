NMES will be implemented with signals received from two channels. In the first channel, the upper electrodes will be placed horizontally just above the hyoid bone. This is the place where the cupping is felt when the finger is pressed right under the chin. In the second channel, the lower electrodes will be placed horizontally, just above the thyrohyoid muscle. This is the place where you can feel a cupping when pressed with your finger, on both sides of the apple in the larynx. The device will be set to start at the lowest power, with very short pulses of approximately 700 microseconds, at intervals of 1 second. The power will be gradually increased according to the device and the power that the patient feels vibration will be stopped. The power to be applied will not exceed 25 milliamps.

FOIS used for evaluation is a two part scale consisting of 7 levels. It is used to show whether the individual is dependent on the feeding tube and the level of oral intake. On this scale, 7 shows the best and 1 shows the worst functional oral intake. The change in FOIS will be our primary outcome measure in our research. It has been evaluated as an appropriate tool to demonstrate the change in functional oral intake in stroke patients. It is suitable as an independent measure of functional oral intake in prospective studies of stroke-related dysphagia.","timeFrame":"before intervention, immediately after intervention, 3 months after the intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) Score","description":"Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) is used to assess participants' dysphagia symptoms, symptom severity, and risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia.

The answer points for each question range from 0 (no problem) to 4 (serious problem). If EAT-10 score is ≥3, it is considered as \"risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia\".
