Patients treated with medical therapy have a 7%-10% risk of recurrent stroke per year for any stroke and a 5%-8% risk per year for ipsilateral ischemic stroke during the first 2 years after ICA occlusion. Internal carotid artery occlusion causes an estimated 61,000 first-ever strokes per year in the US an incidence more than twice the annual occurrence of ruptured intracranial aneurysms Additionally, 40% of subjects with COICA who present with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and 70% of COICA who present with stroke have cognitive decline with increased risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's' disease (AD) with time (2,3).\n\nSymptomatic COICA subjects are at increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and progressive development of vascular dementia and AD with time. Our proposal leverages several compelling retrospective and prospective preliminary data from human to perform this exploratory trial with go/no-go criteria to proceed to a phase 3 based on the data generated","detailedDescription":"Study Design:\n\nProspective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) study\n\nThis is a phase 2 randomized single-center open label clinical trial with randomization of 1:1 to either best medical management vs. best medical management and endovascular revascularization of COICA.\n\nScreening, Enrolling, \\& Randomization:\n\nAll subjects who presents to our tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of COICA will undergo full evaluation including 1) documenting previous history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and/or stroke; 2) cervical and brain CT angiography (CTA) to document complete occlusion; 3) CT perfusion (CTP) to assess for presence of penumbra evident by increased mean transient time (MTT) in the ipsilateral side of COICA; and 4) Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score. If any subject is found to have complete occlusion of COICA, evident of abnormal/prolongation of MTT on CTP, previous history of TIA and or stroke, and MoCA \\<26 or abnormal response on another neuropsychological assessment preformed in the screening battery, then further evaluation is obtained including: MRI spectroscopy to assess for presence/absence of lactate in the ipsilateral watershed area (centrum semiovale), and size of ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala, additional cognitive testing battery, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to document adequately the type of COICA the subject have (type A-D).\n\nIf a subject meets all inclusion criteria (complete occlusion, MoCA \\<26 and/or abnormal other neuropsychological test result, abnormal CTP) they will be randomized, after consent is obtained. If all inclusion criteria are met other than the CTP, they will be enrolled but not randomized. These subjects will only be eligible for best medical management- not surgical intervention.\n\nIf any subject does not have complete occlusion or abnormal MoCA \\>26 or other neuropsychological assessment, then the subject is excluded and no further testing needed (see exclusion criteria).\n\nIf the subject meets all inclusion criteria, then a baseline of complete neurological testing, full demographics, CTA or MRA, CTP, MoCA, additional neurological testing, MRI spectroscopy and DSA are obtained and subject is randomized 1:1 to either best medical management or best medical management + endovascular balloon angioplasty and stenting. Follow up clinic visits are arranged at 6 and 12 months. Repeat testing of MoCA and additional cognitive testing battery are done at these clinical follow-up visits (6 and 12 months). MRI of the brain and is done at 6 and 12 months. DSA is performed at 1 year follow-up for intervention subjects to assess brain bio-markers and revascularization respectively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognition Disorder","Stroke","Occlusion Carotid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"1:1 randomization, 1 non-randomized active comparator arm","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) study","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects meet all inclusion criteria and were randomized to intervention","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular intervention"]},{"label":"Medical arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects meet all inclusion criteria and were randomized to best medical management","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin and Clopidogrel (maximal medical Therapy)"]},{"label":"Non-Randomized Arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subject meets all inclusion criteria EXCEPT abnormal CTP.
