It is single-item measures ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no increase in muscle tone and 4 indicates that the affected part is rigid in flexion or extension.","timeFrame":"Baseline; 6 weeks; 3 months"},{"measure":"Box & Blocks Test","description":"It assesses unilateral gross manual dexterity. Individuals are seated at a table, facing a rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments of equal dimension by means of a partition.
