Following a stroke, the restoration or improvement of walking is a high-ranking goal among patients, but only about half of the population is able to return to typical levels of community ambulation. The resultant decrease in independent mobility is strongly associated with a decline in quality of life. Gait instability is a common contributor to limited mobility through either an increased fall-risk or fear of falling, but current interventions to address post-stroke gait instability have had limited success. This project will conduct initial testing of a novel elastic force-field designed to improve post-stroke gait stability through targeted motor learning. The results of these experiments will serve as the basis for the development of novel gait rehabilitation techniques, which have the potential to increase the quality of life of thousands of Veterans and save millions of dollars."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Error reduction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will complete a 12-week training program, in which they practice walking on a treadmill for 30-minutes during twice-weekly training sessions.

This measure falls within a relatively narrow range among neurologically intact controls, but is substantially reduced in some individuals who have experienced a stroke, indicating a reduced ability to stabilize their gait pattern. This measure relates the mechanical state of the body at the start of each step (mediolateral pelvis displacement and velocity of the pelvis relative to the stance foot) to the step width at the end of the step. Specifically, the partial linear correlation between pelvis displacement and step width was calculated, accounting for variation in pelvis velocity.\n\nThe change in this measure relative to baseline is calculated at four time points (after 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks).","populationDescription":"The total of 44 participants analyzed corresponds to the participants who completed the intervention and follow-up assessment.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","unitOfMeasure":"Correlation coefficient","timeFrame":"baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Error Reduction","description":"Participants will complete a 12-week training program, in which they practice walking on a treadmill for 30-minutes during twice-weekly training sessions.
