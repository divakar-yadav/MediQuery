Electrical stimulation involves placing electrodes on the scalp or skin and passing an electrical current between them. When this is done, an electrical field is created that activates areas of the brain that control muscles. Muscle activity as a result of the stimulation can be recorded and analyzed.","detailedDescription":"This protocol application is written to permit us to use transcranial electrical stimulation, a safe and noninvasive method for activating the brain, spinal cord, or proximal nerves through the skin, in appropriate subjects. We will use this technique to explore the function of the human central and peripheral nervous system and to aid in the diagnosis of neurological disorders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Healthy","Nervous System Diseases","Spinal Cord Injuries"],"keywords":["Amputations","Brainstem Stimulation","Cerebellar Stimulation","Cortical Motor Physiology","Electrical Stimulation","Motor Cortex","Plasticity","Spinal Cord Injury","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":175}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Males and females, ages 18 and over.\n\nDiverse racial groups.\n\nAmputees and others with whom we will have no patient-care relationship may also be considered to be volunteers.\n\nPatients will be recruited from those referred to the Human Motor Control Section, NINDS who have neurological syndromes that are of interest.\n\nOn rare occasions we may attempt to study children as young as 10 years with TES.\n\nIndividuals without indwelling cardiac lines and pacemakers.\n\nPatients recruited for study would come from those referred to the EMG laboratory and to the Human Motor Control Clinic who would have distinct neurologic syndromes from well defined peripheral and central nervous system lesions including hemiplegia from stroke, trauma, tumor or focal demyelination (most commonly patients would have hemiplegia from stroke), peripheral nerve lesions, amputations, spinal cord injury.\n\nNormal volunteers, including NIH employees, would be healthy adults without history of physical examination evidence of neurologic disease and individuals with different types of amputations involving upper and lower extremities.\n\nVolunteers may also be participants in the electrophysiological protocol (84-N-0196).\n\nNo history of epilepsy.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)","city":"Bethesda","state":"Maryland","zip":"20892","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.98067,"lon":-77.10026}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"2004248","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Cohen LG, Meer J, Tarkka I, Bierner S, Leiderman DB, Dubinsky RM, Sanes JN, Jabbari B, Branscum B, Hallett M.
