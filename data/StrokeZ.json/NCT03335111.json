Patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke are enrolled and divided into control group and experimental group. Patients in experimental group are administrated with BAIPC within 3 days from the occurrence of stroke. The National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) will be evaluated at different time point to analyze the influence of BAIPC to acute ischemic patients. The level of IL-4, IL-6，TNF-α as well as the frequency of different sub-populations T cells in the blood at different time point will be detected to explore the possible mechanism of BAIPC protective function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Remote Ischemic Postconditioning"],"keywords":["Remote Ischemic Postconditioning","Peripheral Immunity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"BAIPC group patients are admistrated by 5 cycles extremities ischemia (5-minute blood-pressure cuff inflation up to 50 mmHg higher than baseline, followed by 5-minute cuff deflation).","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Patients without BAIPC are admistrated by 5 cycles extremities ischemia (5-minute blood-pressure cuff inflation using pressure 0 mmHg , followed by 5-minute cuff deflation).
