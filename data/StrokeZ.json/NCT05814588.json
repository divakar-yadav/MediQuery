Some polite studies were done in acute stage of stroke and only short-term effects of tDCS were evaluated along with other outcome measures including upper and lower limb motor recovery, balance and improving activity of daily living. The long-term effects of transcranial direct stimulation only for the improvement of cognition in subacute stage of stroke are yet to be seen. This study will help us in evaluating the long-term effects of aTDCS and RehaCom cognitive therapy on cognition in subacute stage of stroke.","detailedDescription":"Previous literature showed that, the brain has a capacity to recover the loss that comes after brain damage within subacute stage, as in this stage there is high excitation-inhibition phenomena in neural circuit, this excitation-inhibition spectacles may reflect to upsurge the activity of neurotransmitter concentration within cortex that put subtle effect for developing neural plasticity.\n\nMore innovative therapies are used worldwide in patient's cognitive rehabilitation after stroke, for cognitive training including physical movement, paper-and-pencil activities, manipulatives training programs or other aids such as playing cards or a combination of multiple training, along with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and RehaCom cognitive therapy which shows significant effects with (p \\< 0.05) in acute and chronic stages of stroke. Most of the studies used a different type of therapy in therapeutic protocols for other functional improvement including motor recovery exercises for both upper and lower limb balance training, postural stability exercises, manipulative training programs with significant improvement (p \\< 0.05) in real time (tDCS)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Anodal TDCS"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Anodal TDCS","Other: Sham Anodal TDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Anodal TDCS","description":"RehaCom software is a computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation, it targets six programs of brain including attention, memory, and higher executive function, visuo-motor abilities, visual filed, vocational abilities, each module is divided into further subsections there is 36 total subsections, we will work on 6 subsections in every week.\n\nThe aTDCS device is a battery operated, with a pair of rubber conductive electrodes (size 7Ã—5cm) enclosed with sponge saturated pockets (pads).","armGroupLabels":["Group A","Group B"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham Anodal TDCS","description":"rehacom cognitive therapy will be provided to this group participants","armGroupLabels":["Group B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RehaCom Software","description":"RehaCom is a software package that is used for the assessment of cognitive functions.
