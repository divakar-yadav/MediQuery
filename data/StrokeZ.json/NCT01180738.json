BWSTT and OWT are often used by clinicians separately or in tandem. While various aspects of the two interventions have been investigated in the past, limited research has been conducted to compare the effects of the two interventions in patients with chronic stroke.\n\nLonger training durations may not always be feasible due to limited reimbursement options, lack of clinic accessibility, or transportation restrictions for patients with chronic deficits following stroke. A short burst of training consisting of a ''booster''-like protocol may provide a convenient option for some patients with chronic stroke to improve necessary functional skills in a short period of time.\n\nThe primary purpose of this pilot study is to compare walking speed immediately and 3-months after a short-burst of body-weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) or overground walking training (OWT) for adults with chronic stroke. Twenty participants with chronic stroke will be recruited and screened to determine eligibility for the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either BWSTT or OWT for 30 minutes, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Outcome measures will include assessments of gait speed, endurance, walking pattern, fear of falling, balance confidence, anxiety, and activity and participation in daily life. Outcomes will be tested prior to (pre-test) and immediately after (post-test) the assigned intervention and again 3-months after completing the intervention (retention)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Difficulty Walking"],"keywords":["chronic stroke","walking training","rehabilitation","body weight supported treadmill training","physical therapy","balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Body weight supported treadmill training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Body weight supported treadmill training"]},{"label":"Overground walking training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Overground walking training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Body weight supported treadmill training","description":"Training will include 10 sessions over a 2 week period, each session with 30 minutes of walking on a treadmill using a body weight support system.","armGroupLabels":["Body weight supported treadmill training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Overground walking training","description":"Training will include 10 sessions over a 2 week period, each session with 30 minutes of walking overground.","armGroupLabels":["Overground walking training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait speed: measured with the comfortable 10-meter walk test","timeFrame":"The outcome measure will be assessed at pre-test (within 1-week before beginning the intervention), post-test (within 1-week after completing the 2-week intervention period) and at retention (3-months following completion of the intervention)."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait endurance: measured with the 6-minute walk test;
