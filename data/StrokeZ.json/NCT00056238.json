The initial phase of the study is also aimed at determining the optimal dosing regimens for subsequent drug candidate efficacy trials. The trial is also evaluating the appearance of new cerebral hemorrhages on gradient-echo MRI scans, the amyloid ß (Aß) protein levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and the neurological and cognitive functions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Neurologic Diseases, General"],"keywords":["Neurologic Diseases (General)","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"NC-758 (Anti amyloidotic [Aß] agent)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Patients must be 55 years of age or older.\n* Males and females.
