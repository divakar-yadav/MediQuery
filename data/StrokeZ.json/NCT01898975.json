Recently developed, non invasive cardiac output measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous cardiac output(CO) monitoring just by attaching electrode on chest wall. Moreover, CO and SSV derived from NICOM have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal inconclusive patients using gray zone approach.","detailedDescription":"Optimal fluid management has been considered as crucial part to determine postoperative outcome and organ function. Many reports have focussed on evaluation of fluid responsiveness using various parameters such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation (SSV) derived from invasive or semi-invasive monitoring. Recently developed, non invasive cardiac output measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous cardiac output(CO) monitoring just by attaching electrode on thorax. Moreover, CO and SSV derived from NICOM have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal inconclusive patients using gray zone approach."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurological Diseases or Conditions","Fluid Responsiveness","Non Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring","Gray Zone"],"keywords":["Neurosurgical patients","Fluid loading","Fluid responsiveness","NICOM","Stroke volume variation","Pulse pressure variation","Total peripheral resistance","Gray zone approach"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"500ml fluid loading","description":"All enrolled patients","interventionNames":["Other: 500ml fluid loading"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"500ml fluid loading","description":"Fluid loading to evaluate fluid responsiveness","armGroupLabels":["500ml fluid loading"],"otherNames":["500ml loading of crystalloid(Plasma Solution-A Injection CJ) over 15min","at the end of operation, when the main procedure finished and there is no strong","stimulation with stable hemodynamics"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke volume variation","description":"5min following the end of rapid fluid infusion: 5 min after the end of fluid loading","timeFrame":"5min following the end of rapid fluid infusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation with pulse pressure variation","description":"5min following the end of rapid fluid infusion: 5 min after the end of fluid loading","timeFrame":"5 min following the end of rapid fluid infusion"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"TPR(total peripheral resistance), TPRI(total peripheral resistance index)","description":"5min following the end of rapid fluid infusion: 5 min after the end of fluid loading","timeFrame":"5min following the end of rapid fluid infusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ASA I or ASA II patients aged 20-80 undergoing neurosurgery in supine position\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pre-existing arrythmic disorders\n* Congestive heart failure required medical treatment\n* Preoperative Creatinine 1.3mg/dl\n* observing self respiration during the study interventions\n* Bleeding tendency\n* Severe brain edema","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients undergoing neurosurgery under general anesthesia in supine position","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jong-Hwan Lee, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Samsung medical center","city":"Seoul","zip":"135-710","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21550","name":"Pharmaceutical Solutions","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"PhSol","name":"Pharmaceutical Solutions"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
