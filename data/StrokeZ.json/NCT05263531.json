Multidisciplinary rehabilitation has benefit effects on motor recovery and remains the first-line intervention strategy for attenuating motor function impairments. However, the effect of the physiotherapy application alone is not satisfactory, The potential treatment effect of RIC on motor recovery of AIS has not been investigated. The investigators designed this randomized clinical trial to examine whether RIC has a beneficial effect on poststroke motor function recovery.There are 2 arms in this trial: One arm is RIC treatment, the other one is sham RIC treatment. The motor function will be assessed by Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale before and after the treatment to evaluate its exact effect on motor recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["remote ischemic conditioning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"remote ischemic conditioning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) treatment with pressure set at 200 mmHg.","interventionNames":["Device: remote ischemic conditioning"]},{"label":"placebo remote ischemic conditioning","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Receiving sham RIPC treatment with pressure set at 60 mmHg","interventionNames":["Device: remote ischemic conditioning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"remote ischemic conditioning","description":"RIC is a physical strategy performed by an electric autocontrol device with cuffs placed on bilateral arms and inflated to design pressure for 5-min followed by deflation for 5-min, the procedures is performed repeatedly for 5 times.","armGroupLabels":["placebo remote ischemic conditioning","remote ischemic conditioning"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"changes in Fugl-Meyer score","description":"Fugl-Meyer scale assessment (FMA) will be used for assessing improvement of motor function.
