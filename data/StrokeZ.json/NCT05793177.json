The intervention's purpose is to lower the time spend with sedentary behavior and raise the level of physical activity in stroke survivors throughout their everyday life. The intervention contains two motivational interviews with a focus on goal setting, action planning, motivation, fatigue management, and general information on life after stroke. The primary outcome for behavior change is objectively measured physical activity using an activity tracker (ActivPal4 Micro) and secondary glycohemoglobin and changes in quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Behavior","Physical Inactivity","Sedentary Behavior"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Everyday Life is Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Everyday Life is Rehabilitation","description":"Behavior change intervention focuses on implementing more movement into everyday life using action planning, goal setting, and fatigue management.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sedentary time","description":"Time participants spend with sedentary behavior compared between the intervention and control group","timeFrame":"12 weeks follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Physical activity scale (PAS2)","description":"Subjective physical activity","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"The Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL)","description":"Quality of life","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"The General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES)","description":"self-efficacy","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"The Multi-dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) questionnaire","description":"Fatigue","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9)","description":"Depression symptoms","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"The Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA)","description":"The function of upper and lower extremity","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"Timed Up & Go (TUG) test","description":"Mobility","timeFrame":"Baseline,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","description":"cognitive assessment","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)","description":"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline,6,12 and 26 weeks follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Verified ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage\n* Modified rankin score (mRS) 1-3 at discharge\n* Discharged with at rehabilitation plan within 1-14 hospitalization days\n* Able to ambulate independently\n* Speak and understand Danish\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aphasia\n* Unable to give informed consent\n* Unable to ambulate independently\n* Mental illness\n* Other co-morbidity like terminal cancer.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Stefan S Bodilsen, MSPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+4528401595","email":"sbodi@regionsjaelland.dk"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36860816","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Bodilsen SS, Aadahl M, Wienecke T, Thomsen TH.
