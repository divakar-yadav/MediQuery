Given the link between smoking and stroke risk, the investigators believe that providing this imaging in addition to standard smoking cessation education may improve rates of smoking cessation after stroke. If this proves true, addition of a patient's neuroimaging to standard post-stroke smoking cessation education would be an easy method to improve smoking cessation rates in stroke patients, at minimal cost."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Smoking Cessation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standardized smoking cessation counseling","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standardized smoking cessation counseling will be provided at the participant's initial interview.
