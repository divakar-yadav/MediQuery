Literature shows that a stroke has a negative effect on participation. Self-Management (SM) is defined as health promotion and education programs used mostly for people with chronic diseases, which aim at helping patients to maintain a feeling of wellness. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a group-based SM program for post-stroke patients in a community setting, and its contribution to improving participation, compared to standard care.","detailedDescription":"At enrollment eligible patients will be randomized to Intervention + Standard Care or Standard Care group. Within 3 weeks after enrollment all participants will undergo baseline assessment using a predefined set of scales and questionnaires (intervention group will additionally undergo a semi-structured interview). The group-intervention (SM program) will begin after enrollment of at least 4 participants to the intervention group, and within no longer than 5 weeks since enrollment. The intervention will include 12 weekly sessions, each session 2.5 hour long, and will be based on well-known SM interventions that were found effective for stroke patients in the U.S. Standard care will include 'one-on-one' sessions in each paramedical discipline as given regularly in this setting (average of 15-20 sessions per patient). Follow-up measures will be performed within a week after the end of the intervention, and 6 months thereafter, in order to examine long term effectiveness. Outcome measures are questionnaires; change will be assessed by the difference in total score between T1 \\|(pre-intervention), T2 (post-intervention) and T3 (after 6 months)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Self-Management","Stroke","Intervention","Group Processes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Self-Management group-intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Self-Management group-intervention + Standard Care","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Self-Management group-intervention"]},{"label":"Standard Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive Standard Care only","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Standard Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Self-Management group-intervention","description":"At enrollment eligible patients will be randomized to Intervention + Standard Care or Standard Care group.
