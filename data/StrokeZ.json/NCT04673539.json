The population that has suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke has balance disorders. Over the last few years the assessment of balance has taken on special importance, carrying out the development, adaptation and validation of various tools that assess it.\n\nThe Brief-BESTest has 6 items, it has demonstrated comparable reliability to the Mini-BESTest and potentially superior sensitivity. This version represents all dimensions based on the original BESTest theory.\n\nThe purpose is to adapt and validate the Spanish version of the Brief-BESTest in stroke patients in order to have a brief tool, appropriate to the clinical environment and to the characteristics and limitations of these patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Validation Study","Postural Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single group","description":"Instrument validation in stroke patients","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Spanish version of the Brief-BESTest in stroke patients"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Spanish version of the Brief-BESTest in stroke patients","description":"Adaptation and validation of the Spanish version of the Brief-BESTest in stroke Patients","armGroupLabels":["Single group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"BESTest","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Mini-BESTest","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Test","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Time Up and Go Test","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Older than 18 years old\n* Diagnosis of stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cognitive impairment\n* Physical disability that prevents them from completing the assessment\n* No cooperation and communication problems","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Universidad de Salamanca","city":"Salamanca","zip":"37007","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":40.96882,"lon":-5.66388}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
