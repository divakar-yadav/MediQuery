Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the cerebellum can be used to enhance these adaptive processes in stroke recovery. In this randomized, double blind, sham-controlled trial we aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation coupled with intensive physical therapy in promoting gait recovery in hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cerebellar iTBS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intermittent theta burst stimulation applied immediately before the daily physical therapy session for a period of three weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION"]},{"label":"Sham iTBS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham intermittent theta burst stimulation applied immediately before the daily physical therapy session for a period of three weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION","description":"theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a novel form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation that mimics protocols inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) in animal models.
