The proposed study examines a novel intervention, strategy training, that shows promise for helping individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments reduce disability in daily tasks, which may lead to reductions in healthcare costs. We predict that strategy training will result in significantly greater independence 6 months after stroke compared to an attention control intervention, and that strategy training may reduce cognitive impairments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Strategy Training","Attention Control"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Cognition","Disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Strategy Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Strategy training is a form of meta-cognitive instruction that trains individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments to identify and prioritize problematic daily activities, identify the barriers impeding performance, generate and evaluate their own strategies to address barriers, and apply these skills through iterative practice.
