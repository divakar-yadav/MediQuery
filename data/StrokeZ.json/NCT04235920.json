Vascular risk factors were determined from the history taking. Assessment of GCS and NIHSS at the initial presentation was done to assess the stroke severity. Cognitive functions were evaluated in all study participants by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Arabic version. An initial and follow up non-contrast CT brain was done after 7 days which were assessed by ASPECTS. Functional outcomes in stroke cases were assessed after three months by Glasgow Coma Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale. Biomarkers of cognitive impairment like ESR, CRP, S100B, MMP9 and glutamate were evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Outcome, Fatal"],"keywords":["Stroke; ASPEACTS, Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.
