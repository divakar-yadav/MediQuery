Survivors of ICH are at high risk of recurrent ICH and other serious cardiovascular events.\n\nWhile there is strong evidence that this risk can be reduced by lowering the blood pressure (BP) of patients after ICH, many patients with ICH do not receive BP-lowering treatment long-term unless BP levels are particularly high, and many do not receive BP combination therapy.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of fixed low-dose generic BP lowering agents, as a \"Triple Pill\" strategy on top of standard of care for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of ICH and high normal or low grade hypertension. The study is a large-scale, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Haemorrhage (ICH)","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Blood Pressure (BP)","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Triple Pill (active treatment)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"telmisartan 20mg, amlodipine 2.5mg, and indapamide 1.25mg;","interventionNames":["Drug: telmisartan 20mg, amlodipine 2.5mg, and indapamide 1.25mg"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"received via blinded study capsules","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"telmisartan 20mg, amlodipine 2.5mg, and indapamide 1.25mg","description":"1 capsule taken orally once daily for average of 72 months","armGroupLabels":["Triple Pill (active treatment)"],"otherNames":["Triple Pill"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"1 capsule taken orally once daily for average of 72 months","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent Stroke","description":"Time to first occurrence of recurrent stroke, whether ischaemic or haemorrhagic.","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent ICH","description":"Time to first occurrence of recurrent ICH","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Ischaemic Stroke","description":"Time to first occurrence of ischaemic stroke","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Fatal or disabling stroke","description":"Time to first occurrence of fatal or disabling stroke","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Mortality","description":"Mortality","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"MACE","description":"Major adverse cardiovascular events - CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Physical function","description":"Physical function as assessed by smRS","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Change in SBP","description":"Change in SBP","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"HRQoL according to the EQ-5D-3L","description":"Health-related quality of life according to the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensional Assessment, 3-Level version","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Cognitive Impairment","description":"Overall defined by standard cut-points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Cognitive Impairment Supplement","description":"Overall defined by standard cut-points with Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET)","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Medication Adherence","description":"Self-reported measures, Pill counts","timeFrame":"Average of 6 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults (â‰¥18 years) with a history of up to 12 months after symptom onset of primary ICH that is confirmed by imaging (copy of the brain imaging report to be uploaded to the database, labelled with participant identification (ID) and with personal identifiers removed)\n* Clinically stable, as judged by investigator\n* Average of two resting SBP levels measured 5 minutes apart in the range 130-160mmHg recorded in a seated position (National Heart Foundation of Australia Guidelines).
