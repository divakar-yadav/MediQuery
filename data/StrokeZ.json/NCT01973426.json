However, children afflicted by stroke, cerebral palsy, or traumatic brain injury may lose the ability to actively (and accurately) control the thumb, and specifically abduct/adduct the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint and flex/extend the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. We are testing the Isolated Orthosis for Thumb Actuation (IOTA), a device developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University in collaboration with Children's Hospital Boston, for assisting opposable thumb grasping tasks. The IOTA contains an adjustable brace fitted to the thumb and dorsum of the hand that is easy to put on and facilitates grasping motions through flexible cable-driven actuators that assist with CMC joint abduction and MCP joint extension.\n\nIn this pilot study, we plan to investigate whether the IOTA can effectively facilitate the ability of participants to perform a specific set of clinically relevant tasks conducted in a clinic setting.\n\nThe hypothesis for this work is that the IOTA will significantly improve the participant's performance on clinically relevant tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegic Stroke","Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy"],"keywords":["Robot","Thumb","Orthosis","Hemiplegia","Hemiplegic Stroke","Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy","Stroke","Cerebral Palsy","Grasp assistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Children with limited control of their thumb","description":"Children afflicted by hemiplegic stroke or hemiplegic cerebral palsy who have lost the ability to actively (and accurately) control the thumb.","interventionNames":["Device: Isolated Orthosis for Thumb Actuation (IOTA)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Isolated Orthosis for Thumb Actuation (IOTA)","description":"In this pilot study, we plan to investigate whether the IOTA can effectively facilitate the ability of participants to perform a specific set of clinically relevant tasks conducted in a clinic setting.
