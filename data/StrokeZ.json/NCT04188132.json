The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Noninvasive Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based EEG based BCI using motor execution and Motor Imagery tasks can aid in rehabilitation of upper limb movements in chronic stroke.\n\nThe project aims to explore an SMR-based BCI system that can exploit the sensorimotor rhythm voluntary modulation to play a virtual game as neurofeedback using motor executory tasks and imagined hand movements by stroke patients, who suffer from upper limb disability. Studies have shown that movement and motor imagery (MI) (i.e., the mental rehearsal of a movement without any activation of the muscles) induce similar EEG patterns over the motor cortex.\n\nMovement execution, preparation and even observation are usually accompanied by a decrease in µ- and β-rhythm in the cortical area representing the involved body segment. Such a reduction is called event-related desynchronization (ERD).The increase in µ-rhythm, i.e. event-related synchronization (ERS), is observed in the regions of the brain representing body segments, which are not involved in the task.This study is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of a SMR based EEG BCI using motor task and motor imagery and involve a gaming feedback for same.\n\nThe first two days will be used for calibrating the BMI using commands in computer screen followed by further two days for testing the BMI and feedback control during gaming in computer to move the ball in the computer screen."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae","Brain Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot study in patients with fulfilling the eligibility criteria","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EEG BCI closed loop feedback for rehabilitation of upper limb","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This study is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of a SMR based EEG BCI using motor task and motor imagery and involve a gaming feedback for same.\n\nThe first two days will be used for calibrating the BMI using commands in computer screen followed by further two days for testing the BMI and feedback control during gaming in computer to move the ball in the computer screen.","interventionNames":["Other: EEG -BCI based Feedback for rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"EEG -BCI based Feedback for rehabilitation","description":"Subjects will undergo EEG based BCI as feedback for rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["EEG BCI closed loop feedback for rehabilitation of upper limb"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (Upper limb)(Min0-Max66;Total 66)","description":"Change in Hand strength","timeFrame":"4 days"},{"measure":"Decoding motor intent of hand movements using Scalp Electroencephalography(EEG)","description":"Electroencephalographic spectral power changes during Motor execution and Motor Imagery of hand movements in stroke subjects","timeFrame":"4 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* • age: 21-75 years\n\n  * Subacute or chronic stroke;
