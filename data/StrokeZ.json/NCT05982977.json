The oral phase is the initial phase of swallowing activity and the only stage of swallowing that is completely discretionary. Swallowing activity in the oral stage is not only related to the formation and push of food pellets, but also affects the continuity between the transition from spontaneous swallowing to the swallowing reflex.","detailedDescription":"After stroke, patients are prone to oral dysphagia, poor control of food masses and liquids in the mouth, resulting in food spillover, residual and premature overflow, resulting in dehydration, malnutrition, aspiration, pneumonia and other serious consequences, which greatly reduce the eating safety and quality of life of patients after stroke. Therefore, the rehabilitation of oral swallowing function is a way for patients with swallowing disorder after stroke to return to society and improve their quality of life. Previous studies have found that acupuncture is an effective intervention to improve swallowing disorder in oral stage after stroke. Whether acupuncture promotes the improvement of swallowing function in oral stage by regulating the synergic activity of cortical swallowing network and muscle group has not been fully clarified."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia","Stroke","Oral Phase"],"keywords":["Dysphagia","stroke","cortical swallowing network","Oral Phase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study was a parallel, randomized controlled trial.
