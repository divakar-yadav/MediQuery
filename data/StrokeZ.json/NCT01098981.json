The primary efficacy endpoint is functional outcome at 3 months from stroke onset (modified Rankin Score ordinal shift analysis). The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the Target vs Control group experiencing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":675,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Target group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A combined treatment with transcranial US and systemic tPA","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial ultrasound as an adjunctive therapy to tPA"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Systemic tPA alone","interventionNames":["Drug: Standard of care tPA therapy for acute ischemic stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial ultrasound as an adjunctive therapy to tPA","description":"* tPA per approved labeling administered over 60 minutes\n* Ultrasonic headframe with active insonation for 120 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Target group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Standard of care tPA therapy for acute ischemic stroke","description":"* tPA per approved labeling administered over 60 minutes\n* Ultrasonic headframe with sham (inactive) insonation for 120 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin score ordinal shift analysis","description":"The primary objective of this study is to compare clinical recovery rates (modified Rankin score ordinal shift analysis) at 3 months after stroke onset.","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","description":"The secondary outcome is a comparison of the rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 0-24 hours from initiation of treatment.","timeFrame":"0-24 hours from treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
