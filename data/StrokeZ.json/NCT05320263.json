Recently, a large retrospective study supports the interest of thrombectomy in this population .\n\nSpeed and grade of the recanalisation have a major impact on clinical outcome. Favorable outcome at 90 days is strongly associated with the successful recanalization status at the end of the endovascular procedure (OR=4.57, 95%CI=1.24-16.87, P=0.023).\n\nFirst pass effect has been shown to be a strong marker of efficacy of endovascular procedure with significant correlation with clinical outcome.\n\nThrombectomy with Stent retrievers dramatically changed the prognosis of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes and currently used in BAO patients (posterior circulation). Contact aspiration (CA) is currently used in anterior large vessel occlusions (COMPASS trial, Lancet 2019), with similar rates of recanalization and favorable outcomes (Boulanger M, 2019), as well as in BAO patients .\n\nHowever, the benefit of CA compared to SR for the treatment of BAO remains under debate with the superiority of first line CA compared to SR or no difference. Available data are based on retrospective studies with no data from RCT.\n\nIn this context, a randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the benefit of CA versus SR."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["Stroke","Basilar artery occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"It is planned to include a total of 480 patients (240 per am) to show with a 80% power an 12% increase in FPE rate at end of MT with contact aspiration technique, assuming 23 % of FPE in control arm, 5% of spontaneous recanalization and considering one interim futility analysis","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":480,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"contact aspiration first line thrombectomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient randomized in this arm will have the first arm thrombectomy by contact aspiration","interventionNames":["Procedure: Contact aspiration Thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Stent retriever first line thrombectomy","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient randomized in this arm will have the first arm thrombectomy by Stent retriever","interventionNames":["Procedure: Stent retriever thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Contact aspiration Thrombectomy","description":"The contact aspiration approach is performed, as in standard care, using a long sheath positioned in the distal cervical vasculature using an exchange technique.\n\nA large bore balloon guide catheter as to be placed into the cervical ICA.
