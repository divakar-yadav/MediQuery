The aim of this study is to investigate the stroke mechanisms in patients with cancer-associated stroke.","detailedDescription":"Patients with cryptogenic embolic stroke will be prospectively enrolled and categorized into two groups according to the presence of active cancer: cryptogenic embolic stroke with active cancer (cancer-associated stroke) vs. without active cancer (cryptogenic embolic stroke). All patients will undergo brain MRI/MRA, 12-lead electrocardiography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with injection of agitated saline, and 24-hour Holter and/or telemonitoring. Duplex ultrasonography to detect venous thrombosis of the lower extremity will also be performed in patients with a positive right-to-left shunt on echocardiography."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cryptogenic Embolic Stroke","Active Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":118,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cancer-associated stroke","description":"Cryptogenic embolic stroke with active cancer"},{"label":"Cryptogenic embolic stroke","description":"Cryptogenic embolic stroke without active cancer"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of deep vein thrombosis and microembolic signal in cancer related stroke patients","description":"Venous thromboembolism was investigated via Doppler sonography and/or computed tomography pulmonary angiography combined with venous phase CT angiography of the lower extremities.
