Patients assigned to receive hypothermia are cooled to a core temperature of 35°C for 12 hours by means of a non-invasive temperature management system and cold i.v. fluids. Induction of hypothermia is initiated within 6 hours of symptom onset. After 12 hours of successful cooling the target temperature is gradually raised to achieve slow re-warming of 0.2°C/h until the core temperature reaches 36.8°C.\n\nPatients are breathing spontaneously and shivering is controlled with following medication; dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 µg/kg/h (i.v.), buspirone 5-20 mg x 3 (nasogastric tube), and meperidine 25mg (i.v.) when needed.\n\nCore temperature, blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation, ECG and EEG are measured continuously and registered hourly. Blood tests will be taken before, during and after hypothermia. Brain CT will be controlled when normothermia is reached, no later than 30 hours from symptom onset. Brain MRI will be performed 3-7 days from symptom onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acute","Infarction","Ischemic","Thrombolysis","Mild","Hypothermia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hypothermia","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Hypothermia"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hypothermia","description":"Hypothermia to core temperature of 35C for 12 hours, rewarming rate 0.2C until the patient reaches 36.8C","armGroupLabels":["Hypothermia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of patients maintaining temperature below 36.0°C 80% of the 12-hour hypothermia period.","timeFrame":"12 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, infections, hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias, severe disturbance of electrolytes and fluid balance, thrombocytopenia, and serious adverse events","timeFrame":"14 days"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality during acute phase (7 days), 1 month, and 3 month follow-up; and readmission to hospital for any reason within 3-months.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"The proportion of modified Rankin Scale-responders (mRS 0-2), Barthel Index, NIHSS, Glasgow Outcome Scale","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Neuropsychological tests","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Size of infarction in MRI, and grading of the possible hemorrhagic transformation according to SITS scale (MRI includes scout images, DWI, T1, T2, FLAIR, T2*, and MR angiography)","timeFrame":"3-7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic hemispheric stroke treated with Actilyse(tPA)-thrombolysis according to Meilahti protocol\n* NIHSS 7-20 (after thrombolysis) or a significant paresis of arm or leg (NIHSS 3, no movement against gravity) or a significant dysphasia (NIHSS 2-3) despite of the total NIHSS score\n* Symptom onset within 6 hour\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Platelet count \\< 75,000/mm3\n* Known coagulopathy (INR spontaneously \\>1.5)\n* Hemodynamical unstability\n* Recent history of angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction\n* Sepsis within 72 hours\n* Pregnancy\n* Pre-existing neurological disability with modified Rankin Scale Score\\>2\n* Known allergy or intolerance to buspirone, dexmedetomidine, meperidine\n* Intracranial hemorrhage in brain CT scan\n* Intracranial mass lesion (i.e., abscess, tumor, or infection)\n* Participation in an other therapy trial within last 3 months\n* Hypothermia- treatment cannot be initiated within 6 hours of symptom onset\n* Protocol violation in thrombolytic therapy\n* Any condition where researchers assume that the patient is not suitable (must be reasoned)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Markku Kaste, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Helsinki University Central Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"24436240","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Piironen K, Tiainen M, Mustanoja S, Kaukonen KM, Meretoja A, Tatlisumak T, Kaste M.
