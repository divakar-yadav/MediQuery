Qualified subjects are assigned to the test drug and control drug alteplase group according to the ratio of 1:1. After receiving thrombolytic drugs, the subjects need to carry out a series of safety and effectiveness tests. The mRS score and Barthel index score visits are carried out on the 90th day (± 7 days) after thrombolysis. After the visit, the subjects can leave the group.\n\nIn this study, independent blind endpoint evaluators were set up in each research center to evaluate the mRS and Barthel index score 30 and 90 days after thrombolysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1412,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Recombinant human tissue plasminogen kinase derivatives(r-PA) for injection: the first intravenous bolus injection of 18mg, after 30mins, the second intravenous bolus injection of 18 mg, Push slowly for more than 2mins each time.
