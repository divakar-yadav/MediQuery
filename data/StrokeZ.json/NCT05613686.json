Theta burst stimulation (TBS) has achieved a similar effect to traditional rTMS mode. Intermittent TBS (iTBS) could upregulate cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) and continuous TBS (cTBS) with inhibitory effect. Through modulating the excitability of bilateral hemispheres, rTMS could facilitate motor recovery in stroke patients.\n\nThis study will compare efficacy of different doses iTBS in combination with inhibitory rTMS on motor recovery and cortical excitability in subacute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"contralateral 1Hz+ipsilateral iTBS 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received contralateral 1 Hz and ipsilateral iTBS with protocol 1","interventionNames":["Device: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"contralateral 1Hz+ipsilateral iTBS 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received contralateral 1 Hz and ipsilateral iTBS with protocol 2","interventionNames":["Device: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"contralateral 1Hz","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients received contralateral 1 Hz and ipsilateral sham iTBS","interventionNames":["Device: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technology.
