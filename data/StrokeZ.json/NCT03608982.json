However, it is currently unclear what the most effective ways are to teach first aid. It has already been shown that simulated patients have an added value in teaching emergency care to healthcare professionals.\n\nThis paper describes the protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial that will investigate the influence of using a simulated patient during basic first aid training for laypeople on laypeople's knowledge, skills and self-efficacy.\n\nHypothesis: The null hypothesis of this research is that the use of simulated patients during basic first aid training does not result in a statistically significant change in knowledge, skills and self-efficacy concerning the first aid topics for which a simulated patient is used. The alternative is that knowledge, skills and self-efficacy will be influenced by using simulated patients.\n\nMethods: This study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial, that will take place from September 2018 to June 2020. The study population will consist of employees taking a three day first aid certification course with the Belgian Red Cross. The employers requesting a first aid course will be randomised in receiving a course with or without simulated patient. The simulated patient will only be used for the topics first aid for burns and first aid for stroke in the intervention group. The participants will complete a questionnaire to measure their knowledge and self-efficacy before and after the course, and complete a practical skills test after the course testing these first aid topics. To test whether the retention of first aid knowledge and self-efficacy is influenced by using a simulated patient during a certification course, participants following a refresher course one year after the certification course will complete a follow-up questionnaire.\n\nThis cluster-randomized controlled trial will be, to the investigator's knowledge, the first to investigate the added value of simulated patients during first aid courses for laypeople."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Burns","Stroke"],"keywords":["First aid","Simulated patient","Laypeople"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a cluster-randomized trial, in which allocation is done at the level of the companies that request a first aid course for their employees.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will be informed about participating in a study, evaluating the performance of basic first aid courses taught by the Belgian Red Cross, but will be blinded from the actual goal of the research, i.e. testing the added value of simulated patients.\n\nThe outcome assessors will not be aware of the allocation status of participants whose practical skills they judge.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1168,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Simulated patient","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The materials in this course are standardized, and consist of lectures with a slide show, questions \\& answers conversations, and practical exercises on fellow-students.
