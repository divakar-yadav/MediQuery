Patients will be followed up for 3 months after the stroke.","detailedDescription":"This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multi-national, parallel-arm, pivotal study comparing a placebo group to a DP-b99 group treated with intravenous 1.0 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days, in acute ischemic stroke patients with an entry National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 10-16 and a clinical syndrome that includes at least 1 of the following: language dysfunction, visual field defect or Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect) (as reflected by at least 1 point on any of the corresponding items of the NIHSS: 9, 3 or 11). An interim analysis for futility will be performed after Day 90 (or last available observation) primary endpoint data have been collected on about 45% of subjects planned to be enrolled. Clinical trial material (CTM) will be administered within 9 hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke symptoms. Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either DP-b99 or placebo. A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will assess the accumulating safety data periodically and will oversee the interim futility analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","neuroprotective agent"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":446,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DP-b99","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: DP-b99"]},{"label":"Mannitol","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"DP-b99","description":"1mg/kg/day over 4 consecutive days given intravenously and initiated up to 9 hours following acute stroke onset.","armGroupLabels":["DP-b99"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"1mg/kg/day over 4 consecutive days given intravenously and initiated up to 9 hours following acute stroke onset.","armGroupLabels":["Mannitol"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) categorical analysis (\"shift\")","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recovery, defined as a score of ≤ 1 on modified Rankin Score","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Safety and tolerability","description":"the numbers of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, results of physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs and laboratory tests (complete blood count, chemistry and urinalysis)","timeFrame":"throughout study - baseline until day 90"},{"measure":"recovery as assessed by an NIHSS of not more than 1","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"'home time'","description":"exploratory endpoint of 'home time', which measures the length of time (as number of nights)spent at home/relatives' home between hospital discharge and day 90","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n1.
