The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nâ€¢ Virtual reality combined conventional therapy interventions can improve the gait, balance and functional status of stroke patients or not?\n\nParticipants will asked to do about 3 tasks in virtual reality intervention\n\n* Walk in the flat ground\n* Cross the obstacle on the ground\n* Cross to moving obstacles","detailedDescription":"The investigators referred to the scenes designed by previous studies to develop the three virtual environments employed in this study and made slight modifications according to Taiwan's conditions. Google Earth Virtual Reality (Google Inc., Mountain View, California, U.S., 2017) was uesd for the first and second task and Street Champ Virtual Reality (Zynk Software Srl , Cluj, Romania, 2016) was used for the third task.\n\nTime constraints, terrain changes, and moving obstacles were set to increase the difficulty of the walking task. The speed obtained by the 10-m walking pretest was used as the training benchmark. The participants had to complete a task three times to proceed to the next level.\n\nFor Patient Registries: on-site audit.The subjects were referred from the rehabilitation Clinic of Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","balance","virtual reality","walking pace","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"The subjects that received virtual reality functional gait training for 12 sessions.
