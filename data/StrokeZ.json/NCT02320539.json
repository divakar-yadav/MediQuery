In addition, some of the patients will have established invasive neuromonitoring including microdialysis in which we will study changes of certain microRNAs.\n\nDCI as defined by Vergouwen et al in Stroke 2010;41(10):2391-2395:\n\n\"The occurrence of focal neurological impairment (such as hemiparesis, aphasia, apraxia, hemianopia, or neglect), or a decrease of at least 2 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale (either on the total score or on one of its individual components \\[eye, motor on either side, verbal\\]). This should last for at least 1 hour, is not apparent immediately after aneurysm occlusion, and cannot be attributed to other causes by means of clinical assessment, CT or MRI scanning of the brain, and appropriate laboratory studies.\"\n\nSystemic complications:\n\nFurthermore, we wish to compare the expression of 754 specific microRNA in blood drawn on day 3 after ictus between patients with ALI (as described Kahn et al, Crit Care Med. 2006; 34: 196-202) and patients without ALI. Of at least 36 patients expected to be included 12 should statistically develop ALI according to the referred definition.\n\nAdditionally, we wish to compare the expression of 754 specific microRNA between 12 patients developing DCI (group 1) and 12 patients without DCI (group 2) in blood drawn on day 3 after ictus.\n\nMoreover, we wish to compare the expression of 754 specific microRNA in blood between 36 patients (group 1-3) to that of healthy controls. The specific microRNAs of interest in which the expression in blood between patients with systemic complication are analyzed daily to investigate the dynamic changes in expression and compared to the clinical course."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Delayed Cerebral Ischemia","Acute Lung Injury","Cardiac Dysfunction","Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome"],"keywords":["MicroRNA","Cerebrospinal fluid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"MicroRNA profiles from blood and cerebrospinal fluid are investigated."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SAH with DCI","description":"After 21 days from ictus the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are stratified to group 1 or 2 depending on their development of delayed cerebral ischemia."},{"label":"SAH without DCI","description":"After 21 days from ictus the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are stratified to group 1 or 2 depending on their development of delayed cerebral ischemia."},{"label":"SAH good grade","description":"SAH without external ventricular drainage"},{"label":"Healthy controls","description":"Blood sample in healthy donors registered in the National Donor Registry."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Delayed Cerebral Ischemia","description":"Delayed Cerebral Ischemia as defined by Vergouwen et al\\[1\\].
