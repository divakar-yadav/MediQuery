Being able to visualise potentially rescuable brain tissue on scanning may allow more people to be treated. Currently available methods require extra time to acquire and are not therefore widely used. By carrying significant extra oxygen to the brain, the ABL-101 molecule may not only allow the visualisation of salvageable tissue, but also prevent progression of stroke damage in and have an additional direct benefit on tissue survival. Studies in animal models of stroke show smaller areas of stroke damage after ABL-101. There is therefore a rationale for testing this molecule in stroke patients, both as a diagnostic method, and also as a potential therapeutic agent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischaemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ABL-101 IV as per dosing cohort + Supplementary O2 for 24h","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive either ABL-101 or placebo (equivalent volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride) within ascending dose groups of 6 patients each (4 to ABL-101, 2 to placebo).The starting cohort will be Cohort 1: 0.5mL/kg.\n\nIn the event that the start dose of Cohort 1 is considered intolerable in the opinion of the iDMC based on incidence of patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the iDMC will have the option of recommending a lower dose cohort (Cohort -1) of 0.25ml/kg (to a maximum of 25ml) be undertaken.\n\nCohort 1: 0.5 mL/kg to a maximum of 50ml; Cohort 2: 1.5mL/kg to a maximum of 150ml; Cohort 3: 3.0mL/kg to a maximum of 300ml.\n\nAll patients will receive Oxygen 60% by face mask (8l/min) for approximately 24h after ABL-101 or placebo administration.","interventionNames":["Drug: ABL-101"]},{"label":"IV 0.9% NaCl as per dosing cohort + supplementary O2 for 24h","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Cohort 1: Volume matched to the calculation used for ABL-101 using patient weight; Cohort 2: Volume matched to the calculation used for ABL-101 using patient weight; Cohort 3: Volume matched to the calculation used for ABL-101 using patient weight.\n\nAll patients will receive Oxygen 60% by face mask (8l/min) for approximately 24h after ABL-101 or placebo administration.","interventionNames":["Other: 0.9% NaCl"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ABL-101","description":"ABL-101 is provided as a sterile phospholipid-based emulsion for intravenous administration.","armGroupLabels":["ABL-101 IV as per dosing cohort + Supplementary O2 for 24h"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"0.9% NaCl","description":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["IV 0.9% NaCl as per dosing cohort + supplementary O2 for 24h"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 dose levels of ABL-101 and supplemental oxygen in acute stroke patients.","description":"Incidence of Serious Adverse Events and AEs of special interest up to visit 6 (day 7±2).","timeFrame":"7 days±2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of serious adverse events throughout the entire study period.","timeFrame":"30 days±5"},{"measure":"Incidence of adverse events of special interest","timeFrame":"30 days±5"},{"measure":"Incidence of adverse reactions, adverse events, serious adverse events and serious adverse reactions, up to visit 7 (30±5 days) post administration of Investigational medicinal product.","timeFrame":"30 days±5"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distribution at day 30.","description":"The mRS is a hierarchical ordinal scale used to assess disability in stroke trials, with seven discrete levels that range from No Symptoms (mRS=0) to death (mRS=6).
