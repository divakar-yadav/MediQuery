The candidate circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be verified as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Noncoding RNAs have been highlighted to be involved in the pathological process of ischemic stroke (IS). The purpose of this protocol will investigate the expression pattern of circular RNA (circRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) by next-generation sequencing in patients with acute ischemic stroke and healthy control. The candidate circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be verified as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. Distinctive expression patterns of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be identified by the next-generation sequencing and individual quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A diagnostic or predictive model will be established using logistic regression. The panel of these altered ncRNAs may be associated with acute IS and could serve as a novel diagnostic or predictive method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","noncoding RNA","clinical significance","outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"An 10 ml peripheral venous blood will be collected from the participants before and after interventions (i.e. intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy)"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AIS group","description":"This group includes patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).","interventionNames":["Genetic: Sequencing of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA"]},{"label":"HC group","description":"This group includes healthy controls (HC).","interventionNames":["Genetic: Sequencing of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Sequencing of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA","description":"Next generation sequencing of circular RNA (circRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)","armGroupLabels":["AIS group","HC group"],"otherNames":["Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Differential expression pattern of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA","description":"Differential expression pattern of circular RNA (circRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) will be compared between AIS group and HC group, thus candidate circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be verified as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of AIS.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prognostic value of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA in acute ischemic stroke","description":"The prognosis of AIS patients will be analyzed between differential expressed candidate miRNA/lncRNA after they have completed the systematic therapy.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Correlation of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA and inflammatory factors in acute ischemic stroke","description":"Correlation of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA and inflammatory factors on admission will be explored in acute ischemic stroke.","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Correlation of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA and stroke-associated infection","description":"Correlation of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA and stroke-associated infection will be explored in acute ischemic stroke.","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Dynamic changes of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA during the follow-up period","description":"Dynamic changes of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be explored before and after endovascular therapy","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 18 years or older\n* Confirmed acute ischemic stroke by a diffusion-weighted imaging-position lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a new lesion on a brain computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Within 72 hours of symptom onset\n* Good performance status\n* Signed an approved informed consents\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-a history of hemorrhagic infarction, chronic kidney/liver diseases, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, active malignant disease, and inflammatory or infectious diseases","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"There will be 5 AIS patients and 5 HCs, whose data will be applied for construction of diagnostic and predictive models of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA from the circulating blood.
