These abnormal co-activation patterns are thought to be due to abnormal movement planning.The MCI aims to reduce abnormal co-activation by providing feedback about individual muscle activations.\n\nThis randomized, controlled, blinded study will test the home use of an MCI in chronic and acute stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will be blinded as to sham vs. intervention, but not as to which interventional arm.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":96,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chronic stroke MCI Electromyogram (EMG) pairs","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Decoupling 2 muscles at a time with MCI","interventionNames":["Behavioral: MCI"]},{"label":"Chronic stroke MCI EMG triplets","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Decoupling 3 muscles at a time with MCI","interventionNames":["Behavioral: MCI"]},{"label":"Chronic stroke MCI while reaching","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Decoupling muscles with MCI while reaching to targets","interventionNames":["Behavioral: MCI"]},{"label":"Chronic stroke Sham MCI","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham control group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sham MCI"]},{"label":"Acute stroke MCI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Decoupling muscles with MCI in acute stroke subjects","interventionNames":["Behavioral: MCI"]},{"label":"Acute stroke Sham MCI","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Acute stroke subjects sham comparator","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sham MCI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"MCI","description":"EMG-controlled game","armGroupLabels":["Acute stroke MCI","Chronic stroke MCI EMG triplets","Chronic stroke MCI Electromyogram (EMG) pairs","Chronic stroke MCI while reaching"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sham MCI","description":"Sham control game","armGroupLabels":["Acute stroke Sham MCI","Chronic stroke Sham MCI"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"Timed","timeFrame":"baseline to 6 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Upper Extremity (UE)","timeFrame":"baseline to 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Motor Activity Log","timeFrame":"baseline to 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Total score","timeFrame":"baseline to 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment UE","timeFrame":"baseline to 10 weeks"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"Timed","timeFrame":"baseline to 10 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nChronic stroke participants\n\n* Hemiparesis from first ever stroke at least 6 months prior to screening\n* Severe motor impairment (FMA of 7-30)\n* At least some voluntary shoulder and elbow muscle activation.\n\nAcute stroke participants\n\n* Hemiparesis from first ever stroke within the past 21 days\n* Severe motor impairment (FMA of 3-20), or total Manual Motor Score of 1-8 combined in Shoulder Abduction and Finger Extensors\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cognitive impairment with at least moderately impaired attention, or unable to follow instructions of the MCI task\n* Visual impairment (such as hemianopia) preventing full view of the screen\n* Anesthesia or neglect in the affected arm, or visual hemineglect (score of 2 on the NIH Stroke Scale Extinction and Inattention subtest).\n* Participation in another study on the affected arm within 6 weeks of enrollment or any pharmacological study\n* Inability to understand or follow commands in English due to aphasia or other reason\n* Diffuse or multifocal infarcts\n* Substantial arm pain preventing participation for 90 minutes a day\n* New spasticity treatment (pharmacological or Botox)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Marc W Slutzky, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"3125034653","email":"mslutzky@northwestern.edu"},{"name":"Cynthia Gorski","role":"CONTACT","email":"cynthia.gorski@northwestern.edu"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Northwestern University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60611","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34415114","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Hung NT, Paul V, Prakash P, Kovach T, Tacy G, Tomic G, Park S, Jacobson T, Jampol A, Patel P, Chappel A, King E, Slutzky MW.
