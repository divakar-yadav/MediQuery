This improvement is accompanied by an increase in the number of stroke survivors. One of the major issues for these ever-increasing survivors is the prevention of recurrence. According to data from the 3 French registries, more than 20% of patients have at least one recurrence. Secondary prevention treatment has demonstrated his efficacy to prevent stroke recurrence.\n\nThis evolution justifies identifying factors associated with adherence to secondary prevention treatment, measured at 1 year post-stroke / transient ischemic attack (TIA), in patients included in the STROKE 69 cohort."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":633,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack","description":"The cohort will be constituted of all consecutive patients admitted for a stroke or transient ischemic attack by the Rhône's emergency medical help service (SAMU), or in one of the emergency unit or stroke unit of the Rhône area, and presenting a symptom-onset (the last time the patient was seen without deficit) less than 24 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: Patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack","description":"Determination of factors associated to the conformity to secondary prevention treatment 1, 2 and 3 years post a stroke or transient ischemic attack.","armGroupLabels":["Cohort of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Compliance to secondary prevention treatment 1 year post a stroke or transient ischemic attack","description":"The overall medication possession ratio is the average of the medication possession ratio calculated for each therapeutic class (antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, hypolipidemic agents and oral antidiabetics).\n\nThe medication possession ratio will be calculated from dispensing data from regional health insurance database and prescription data from the STROKE 69 study.
