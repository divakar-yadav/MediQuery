Investigators will compare core temperature, hydration status, practice guidelines regarding rest and hydration, and baseline knowledge of heat illness and hydration among the three levels. The hypothesis is higher peak temperatures will be observed in the younger less experienced football players.","detailedDescription":"Observations will occur over a 4-5 day period at the start of pre-season training camp. Researchers will meet with the high school volunteers and their parents to discuss the study and obtain informed consent prior to participating. Participants will swallow the HQInc CorTemp pill at least three hours (or late the night before) before practice. Temperature readings will be scanned every 15-30 minutes throughout practice. Pre and post practice weights will be recorded as well as urine specific gravity to help assess hydration status. Participants will also fill out a short 1 page questionnaire regarding their prior heat acclimatization, sleep habits, and baseline knowledge of hydration and heat illness. Protocol will be the same at all three age/competition levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Exertional Heat Illness","Hydration Status"],"keywords":["Exertional heat illness","Hydration Status","Preseason football","heat stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Professional football players","description":"Offensive and defensive professional football players ranging in age from 22 to 30 years old."},{"label":"Collegiate Football Players","description":"Division III collegiate football players ranging in age from 20 to 23 years old."},{"label":"High School Football Players","description":"High school football players ranging in age from 16 to 18 years old."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Peak core body temperature","description":"Measured via HQInc ingestible core thermometer throughout practices.","timeFrame":"The first 3-4 days of preseason football practice for each cohort."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hydration status before and after preseason football practice","description":"Measured via urine specific gravity and body weights before and after practice.","timeFrame":"Over first 3-4 days of each cohort's preseason camp."},{"measure":"Baseline knowledge of hydration status and heat illness in football","description":"Athletes will be administered a 14 question survey covering various topics with regards to practice regulation, heat illness, and hydration.","timeFrame":"Up to August 30th, 2013"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Football player on one of the teams from the pre-selected teams.
