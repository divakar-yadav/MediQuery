Detailed phenotype data will be collected in a specially designed BRAINS data collection form. Stroke will be confirmed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and subtyped according to the Trial of ORG10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification. Baseline clinical and demographic data will also be collected. Blood samples will be collected in EDTA coated plastic serological tubes from all consenting patients and controls by means of a single venepuncture and DNA extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using standard procedure and stored at -20Â°C. Following genotyping the genetic data will be merged with phenotype data (environmental risk factors, stroke sub-type) for analysis.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Pankaj Sharma, MD PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01784434455","email":"Pankaj.Sharma@rhul.ac.uk"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pankaj Sharma, MD PhD","affiliation":"Royal Holloway University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Imperial College London","status":"RECRUITING","city":"London","zip":"SW7 2BX","country":"United Kingdom","contacts":[{"name":"Pankaj Sharma, MD PhD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.50853,"lon":-0.12574}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000083302","term":"Hemorrhagic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2405","name":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke Hemorrhagic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
