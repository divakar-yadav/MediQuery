Spasticity in upper extremities may interfere with motor voluntary function, activities of daily living and cause muscle pain. Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been shown to relieve spasticity and pain in upper extremities of stroke patients. There are no researches to compare the efficiency of BTX-A by different injection guidance methods in stroke patients. The aims of our study were to compare the injection locations of key spastic muscles on upper extremity by three different guidance localization methods ( surface anatomy landmark, ultrasonography, electric stimulation) and the effectiveness. The investigators will enroll 60 hemiplegic stroke patients with upper extremity spasticity more than modified Ashworth scale ( MAS) 1+ and duration more than 6 months. Under different guidance methods (surface anatomy landmark/ ultrasonography /electric stimulation ), BTX-A will be injected to the key spastic muscles on upper extremity. Outcome measures include MAS, motor function ( Brunnstrom stage of upper extremity), range of motion , the degree and visual analog scale of pain , pinch and grasp power，Stroke Impact Scale, Barthel index and upper extremity function (Nine hole peg test，Action Reaearch Arm Test，Wolf Motor Function test，Chedoke Arm and Han Activity Inventory，Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale，Motor Activity Log). All the assessments will be performed before BTX-A injection and followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after injection. After performing all the assessments, investigators will investigate the efficiency of BTX-A by different guidance methods.\n\nFour of arms:\n\nultrasonography direct-guidance: To inject Botulinum
