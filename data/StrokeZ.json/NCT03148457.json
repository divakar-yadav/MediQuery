Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are highly effective for secondary stroke prevention in these patients, but DOACs were never initiated \\<7 days after stroke onset in recent trials. The ELAN trial will determine the net benefit of early versus late initiation of DOACs in patients with acute ischaemic stroke related to AF.\n\nThe main objective is to estimate the net benefit of early versus late initiation of DOACs in patients with acute ischaemic stroke related to AF.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to assess all vascular events and all-cause mortality after early initiation of DOACs in patients with acute ischaemic stroke related to AF compared to late initiation.","detailedDescription":"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia increasing the risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism and thus mortality and morbidity. Anticoagulation therapy, such as with vitamin K antagonists effectively prevents strokes in patients with AF, however, increases bleeding complications leading to symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists in preventing recurrent strokes, but with lower rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Therefore, these new agents are potentially ideal drugs to treat patients with ischaemic stroke related to AF. However, in previous trials comparing DOACs with vitamin K antagonists, therapy was initiated later than 7-14 days after onset of ischaemic stroke. Whether, earlier initiation of DOACs may prevent recurrent stroke without increasing the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage remains to be determined.\n\nObjectives The main objective is to estimate the net benefit of early versus late initiation of DOACs in patients with acute ischaemic stroke related to AF.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to assess all vascular events and all-cause mortality after early initiation of DOACs in patients with acute ischaemic stroke related to AF compared to late initiation.\n\nMethods All patients of 18 years or older with an acute ischaemic stroke related to AF should be screened for this trial.\n\nPatients in the experimental arm (early treatment) and the control arm (late treatment) will receive direct oral anticoagulants for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. Depending on the size of the infarction, early treatment will be started within 48 hours after symptom onset (minor and moderate ischaemic stroke) or at day 6 + 1 day after symptom onset (major ischaemic stroke). Patients in the control arm will receive late treatment as per current recommendations (i.e. minor ischaemic stroke after day 3 + 1 day, moderate ischaemic stroke after day 6 + 1 day and major ischaemic stroke after day 12 + 2 day).\n\nThe primary outcome is a composite of major bleeding, recurrent ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and/or vascular death at 30 ± 3 days after randomisation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischaemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Direct oral anticoagulation","Apixaban","Dabigatran","Rivaroxaban","Edoxaban","Therapy initiation","Major bleeding","Atrial fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2013,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Early treatment of patients with ischaemic stroke related to atrial fibrillation (AF) with direct oral anticoagulations (DOACs).","interventionNames":["Drug: Early treatment with Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Dabigatran (Pradaxa®), Apixaban (Eliquis®) or Edoxaban (Lixiana®)"]},{"label":"Late treatment","type":"OTHER","description":"Treatment with direct oral anticoagulations (DOACs) according the current standard practice in patients with acute ischemic stroke related to atrial fibrillation (AF).","interventionNames":["Drug: Late treatment with Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Dabigatran (Pradaxa®), Apixaban (Eliquis®) or Edoxaban (Lixiana®)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Early treatment with Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Dabigatran (Pradaxa®), Apixaban (Eliquis®) or Edoxaban (Lixiana®)","description":"Early treatment will be started within 48 hours after symptom onset (minor and moderate ischaemic stroke) or at day 6 + 1 day after symptom onset (major ischaemic stroke)","armGroupLabels":["Early treatment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Late treatment with Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Dabigatran (Pradaxa®), Apixaban (Eliquis®) or Edoxaban (Lixiana®)","description":"Patients in the control arm will receive late treatment as per current recommendations (i.e. minor ischaemic stroke after day 3 + 1 day, moderate ischaemic stroke after day 6 + 1 day and major ischaemic stroke after day 12 + 2 day).","armGroupLabels":["Late treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite of major bleeding, recurrent ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and/or vascular death","timeFrame":"30 ± 3 days after randomisation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Major bleeding","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Non-major bleeding","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Recurrence of stroke","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Systemic embolism","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Vascular death","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality","timeFrame":"90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Major cardiovascular events defined as composite of stroke, myocardial infarct, heart failure or cardiovascular death","timeFrame":"90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Silent brain lesions","description":"If CT/MRI is performed in clinical routine","timeFrame":"90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Favourable outcome defined as mRS ≤ 2 and shift analysis adjusted to premorbid mRS","timeFrame":"90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"NIHSS","timeFrame":"90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Transient ischemic attack","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Undetermined stroke","timeFrame":"30 days, 90 days after randomisation"},{"measure":"Compliance","timeFrame":"30 days after randomisation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Written informed consent according to country specific details\n* Age: ≥18 years\n* Acute ischemic stroke, either confirmed by MRI or CT scan (tissue based definition) or by sudden focal neurological deficit of presumed ischaemic origin that persisted beyond 24 hours and otherwise normal non-contrast CT scan.
