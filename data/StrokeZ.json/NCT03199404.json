Recanalization success (as assessed using a TICI Score), along with the time to recanalization and number of passes needed for success will be assessed at the conclusion of the procedure. In addition, neurologic recovery (as evaluated using the Modified Rankin Scale and National Institutes of Health Score) will be assessed at 24 hours, discharge, and 90 days after the thrombectomy procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3
