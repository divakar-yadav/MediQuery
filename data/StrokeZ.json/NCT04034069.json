However, its clinical utility is highly affected by the response variability. New evidence has reported that preceding iTBS with a priming session of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), may stabilize and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS, on top of a standard robot-assisted training (RAT) on improving the upper limb motor functions of patients with chronic stroke and to explore potential sensorimotor neuroplasticity with electroencephalography (EEG). A three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be performed with an estimated total of 36 patients with subacute or chronic stroke. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10-session intervention of different TBS protocols (i.e., cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), delivered for 3-5 sessions per week, lasting for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive a 60-minute standard RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcome will be Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores (FMA-UE). Secondary outcomes will be Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), kinematic outcomes generated during RAT as well as and EEG."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","theta burst stimulation","upper limb","metaplasticity","priming"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cTBS + iTBS, in addition to robot-assisted training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 10-session intervention of priming iTBS protocol (cTBS followed by iTBS, with an interval of 10 minutes).
