Electroacupuncture was indicated to promote activities of diaphragm and improve diaphragmatic function. Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture in assisting ventilator weaning in patients with severe stroke. Sixties eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture treatment one session per day until the success of ventilator weaning (up to 21 days). The primay outcome is the ventilation duration within 21 days after enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Stroke","Electroacupuncture"],"keywords":["ventilator weaning","severe stroke","electroacupuncture"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Electroacupuncture","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the electroacupuncture group received acupuncture at Xuanji (CV21), Danzhong (CV27), Qihai (CV06), Guanyuan (CV04), and bilateral Liangmen (ST21) and Zusanli (ST36).

Paired electrodes from the electroacupuncture apparatus were attached to the needle handles of Xuanji (CV21) and Danzhong (CV27), Qihai (CV06), Guanyuan (CV04), bilateral Liangmen (ST21), and bilateral Zusanli (ST36). The electroacupuncture stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with an intermittent wave of 50 Hz and a current intensity of 1 to 5mA (preferably with the skin around the acupoints shivering mildly without pain).
