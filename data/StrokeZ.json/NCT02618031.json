Treatment of AIS includes EVT and medical treatment. EVT is typically not offered to patients after 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. The current study is based on the belief that patients can be successfully treated with the EVT up to 8 hours, as long as they have good peripheral blood flow (collateral flow) to the area of tissue blocked of the primary blood supply.\n\nThe study will evaluate the ability of the capillar index score (CIS) to identify patients who can be successfully treated with EVT. The CIS quantifies blood supply to the ischemic area from peripheral vessels (collateral flow) based on diagnostic cerebral angiogram. Patients are graded on a scale from 0-3, with 0 and 1 considered a poor CIS (pCIS) and 2 and 3 considered a favorable CIS (fCIS). All patients will be treated with EVT and medical treatment consistent with national guidelines.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the clinical outcome at 90 days between fCIS group versus pCIS group. The secondary endpoint is the influence of successful revascularization on outcomes for patients with fCIS or pCIS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Brain Ischemia","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["capillary index score","acute ischemic stroke","collateral circulation","cerebral ischemia","diagnostic imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be assigned to one of two groups based on the outcome of diagnostic evaluation.
