This is due to a lack of normative data for older adults and reliable risk stratification methods to develop effective approaches to the prevention of frailty.\n\nIn this study, the investigators plan to form a common dataset for phenotype identification, risk stratification of frailty and its targeted treatment plans in the at-risk and mildly frail population.","detailedDescription":"Osteosarcopaenia and multimorbidity have emerged as two key antecedent factors driving the cycle of frailty, leading to adverse outcomes. However, it remains unclear how multimorbidity and/or osteosarcopaenia act singly or in concert to influence the expression and trajectory of the frailty continuum.\n\nOPTIMA-C will develop unifying administrative and data platforms, exploring the feasibility of inclusive screening for sarcopaenia early during rehabilitation hospital stay. Early muscle ultrasound will also be utilised to determine key muscles possibly predictive of rehabilitation functional or global outcomes in the studied populations and their correlation with acute disease outcomes. Digital markers are quantified and correlations are investigated with physical, muscle and bone imaging findings."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Knee Osteoarthritis","Breast Cancer"],"keywords":["Frailty","Multimorbidity","Osteosarcopaenia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Venous blood samples will be collected (50ml; about 10 teaspoons) for lab assay to assess metabolic health and inflammation"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"Both acutely admitted stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation and chronic recovered stroke outpatients will be recruited."},{"label":"Traumatic Brain Injury","description":"Both acutely admitted TBI patients undergoing rehabilitation and chronic recovered TBI outpatients will be recruited."},{"label":"Breast Cancer","description":"Only recovered breast cancer patients."},{"label":"Knee Osteoarthritis","description":"For patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence (rates) of Frailty","description":"Based off different outcomes determined in the study","timeFrame":"Through study's data collection period, up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Severity of Frailty","description":"Based on CFS - 9-point clinical assessment tool evaluating an individual's frailty status; maximum score: 9; higher score indicates increased frailty.","timeFrame":"For inpatient: Visit 1 (within 2 weeks of admission) to Visit 6 (end of 3rd year); For outpatient: Visit 1 (baseline) to Visit 4 (end of 3rd year)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Body Composition Analysis (BCA)","description":"Measured using weak electrical current passed from feet to estimate proportion of muscle, fat and water mass.","timeFrame":"For inpatient: Visit 3 (6 months post-event) to Visit 6 (end of 3rd year); For outpatient: Visit 1 (baseline) to Visit 4 (end of 3rd year)"},{"measure":"Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)","description":"Measures 3 components: (1) 5 times chair stand test; (2) Balance test; (3) Gait speed (4m walk test).
