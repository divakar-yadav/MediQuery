Traditional rehabilitative therapies can help regain motor function and ameliorate disability. There are increasing community and other facilities offering rehabilitation in the form of conventional, recreational and alternative (Yoga, Tai-chi) therapy. However, the implementation of these conventional therapy techniques in individuals with a neurological disorder like stroke and the elderly population is tedious, resource-intensive, and costly, often requiring transportation of patients to specialized facilities. Based on recent evidence suggesting significant benefits of repetitive, task-orientated training, investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative therapies such as exergaming based therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling individuals with neurological impairments and the elderly, compared to conventional therapeutic rehabilitation. This pilot study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on compliance and efficacy as well as performing power analysis and sample size calculation for developing it into a randomized controlled trial for extramural funding purposes. The objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility, compliance and efficacy of exergaming therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling chronic stroke individuals and the elderly population.","detailedDescription":"While conventional balance training facilitates balance control and gait functions, the exercises involved in the training are labor-intensive, highly repetitious leading to monotonicity and decreased motivation levels. Therefore, many health care researchers are involved in identifying various methods to reduce the risk of falls addressing the barriers in conventional training methods while having the potential to translate it at home. A pilot study identified that supplementary cognitive training along with Wii-fit balance training resulted in improving dual-task volitional balance control post-stroke. Based on this preliminary finding, this current pilot study aimed to identify:\n\n1. The efficacy of cognitive-motor exergaming (with Wii-fit) compared to conventional balance training among people with chronic stroke\n2. Exergaming (with Kinect) on domains of balance control and cognition among people with chronic stroke\n3. The efficacy of Exergaming (with Kinect) compared to conventional balance training method on domains of balance control and cognition among healthy older adults\n\nThis pilot study used Wii-fit Nintendo/ Microsoft Kinect, an off the shelf, commercially available and a cost-effective device that provides similar benefits of exergaming. Community-dwelling people with chronic stroke and healthy older adults involved in the study underwent 6 weeks of exergaming or conventional balance training in a tapering manner in a laboratory setting. Participants were assessed for motor and cognitive performance in the laboratory during volitional and reactive balance control while performing a secondary cognitive task. The performance outcome determined the effect on cognitive-motor interference during dual-tasking."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke","Healthy Aging"],"keywords":["Dual-task training","Cognitive-motor training","Conventional training","Virtual-reality exergaming","Dance Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cognitive-motor Exergaming","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A total of 6 Wii-fit games: Bubble balance, Table Tilt, Tightrope walking, Soccer head, Basic Run and Basic Step.
