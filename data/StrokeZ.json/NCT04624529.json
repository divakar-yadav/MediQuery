Acute stroke units admit a large number of patients and adequate referral to rehabilitation services is essential in terms of quality of care. A self-evaluation tool to evaluate cognitive function was developed by the occupational therapy department.\n\nPatients with mild strokes and pre-stroke independent for instrumental daily activities fill out this self-evaluation tool, which is a paperwork task. Semi-structured interpretation is performed by physician and may result in referral to the occupational therapist for comprehensive evaluation.\n\nIn this study the validity and reliability of the self-evaluation tool will be examined."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Cognitive Dysfunction"],"keywords":["Occupational therapy","Evaluation tool"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Self evaluation tool","description":"This self-evaluation tool to evaluate cognitive function, developed by the occupational therapy department, is a paperwork task with guidelines for semi-structured interpretation."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Self-evaluation tool","description":"cognitive screening tool","timeFrame":"within one week after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Oxford Cognitive Screen","description":"cognitive measure","timeFrame":"within one week after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessement","description":"cognitive measure","timeFrame":"within one week after stroke onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnose of stroke\n* written consent\n* age 18 years or older\n* less than 1 week after stroke onset\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* not able to write/read\n* not able to understand Dutch\n* unilateral motor deficit in upper limb (NIHSS score for upper limb +2)\n* referred to stroke unit with Transcient Ischemic Attack","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Persons with stroke admitted to the acute stroke unit are consecutive recruited.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Robin Lemmens, PhD, MD","affiliation":"UZ/KU Leuven","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UZ Leuven","city":"Leuven","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.87959,"lon":4.70093}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000060825","term":"Cognitive Dysfunction"},{"id":"D000003072","term":"Cognition Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000019965","term":"Neurocognitive Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M29395","name":"Cognitive Dysfunction","asFound":"Cognitive Dysfunction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5991","name":"Cognition Disorders","asFound":"Cognitive Deficits","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21526","name":"Neurocognitive Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
