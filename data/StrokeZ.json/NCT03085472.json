Professor Peng Xie will be the senior consultant for the study. The Chongqing intracerebral hemorrhage study will focus on the epidemiology, natural history, pathogenesis, laboratory, radiological aspects, clinical outcomes and the effects of treatment in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nThe clinical, laboratory, imaging, genetic and outcome data of patients diagnosed with acute intracerebral hemorrhage will be prospectively collected. The prognosis of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage will be assessed by using several outcome measure scales at different time points.","detailedDescription":"The Chongqing intracerebral hemorrhage study will try to address several key issues in ICH. The baseline clinical data including demographic, disease severity scores, prior drug history and relevant medical history, premorbid mRS scores will be prospectively recorded. The admission and follow-up imaging data of all registered patients will be saved as Dicom format for future use and review. The functional outcomes will be assessed and recorded by experienced neurologists."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke","Hematoma"],"keywords":["intracerebral
