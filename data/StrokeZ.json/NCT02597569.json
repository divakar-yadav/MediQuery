Patients with cognitive impairment who are admitted to inpatient stroke rehabilitation often receive services based on outdated impairment-reduction models, rather than recommended function-based approaches. These two issues, reduced access to rehabilitation and the knowledge-to-practice gap, both stem from a reported lack of skills and knowledge on the part of some stroke rehabilitation teams to foster recovery in people with cognitive impairments. To address these issues, the investigators will implement and evaluate a multi-faceted, supported, integrated knowledge translation initiative, targeted specifically at the inter-professional application of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP), called CO-OP KT. CO-OP is a contemporary, effective, cognitive strategy-based treatment approach. CO-OP KT is a combination of the CO-OP Approach with multi-faceted knowledge translation support. Clinical staff at participating institutions will receive CO-OP KT training.\n\nThe long-term objective of CO-OP KT is to optimize functional outcomes for individuals with stroke and cognitive impairments. Three specific research questions have been posed, one of which is the focus of this registration. That sub study relates to patient outcomes following the CO-OP KT training initiative and it will be addressed using a non-randomized design with historical controls. Patient participants who enroll in the project prior to implementing the CO-OP KT training will belong to the historical control group. Patient participants who enroll in the project after the CO-OP KT training will belong to the CO-OP KT Exposure group.","detailedDescription":"The investigative team will implement and evaluate a multi-faceted, supported, integrated knowledge translation initiative called CO-OP KT.\n\nThe long-term objective of CO-OP KT is to optimize functional outcomes for individuals with stroke and cognitive impairments. Three specific research questions are posed, one of which is the focus of this registration:\n\n1. Is CO-OP KT associated with changes in activity, participation, and self-efficacy to perform daily activities in patients with cognitive impairment following stroke at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and at 1, 3, and 6-month follow-ups? The research question, which relates to patient outcomes, will be addressed using a non-randomized design with historical controls.\n\nRecruitment:\n\nFive inpatient stroke rehabilitation units or combined stroke/neurology units within the Toronto Stroke Networks have agreed to participate. It is estimated that the 5 units together will have approximately 80 admissions per month. Patients admitted to the inpatient stroke unit who have at least some cognitive impairment will be recruited. Cognitive impairment will be determined using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Patients with scores lower than 26 will be included. Based on data from a previously published study, a sample size of 13 per group will have 80% power to detect a between-group difference of 9 points on the FIMâ„¢, standard deviation of 8. Allowing for 30% attrition from all sources, the investigators will recruit 17 participants per group, 34 in total. Based on past experience, the investigators expect a consent rate of 1 participant per site per month. Thus, recruitment is highly feasible, and will likely be completed in 4 months for each group.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nDescriptive statistics will be compiled for all quantitative data collected. Between- and within-group differences on the outcome measures will be examined using repeated measures ANOVA for the non-randomized trial of individual patients with historical controls."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance","health services accessibility","cognitive impairment","rehabilitation","integrated knowledge translation","interrupted time series","The CO-OP Approach"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Historical Control","description":"Patient participants will be recruited from an inpatient rehabilitation stroke unit prior to introducing CO-OP KT training to the stroke team.
