Investigators will also evaluate if the beneficial effects of rehabilitation continue after discharge from a rehabilitative program.","detailedDescription":"The long-term effects of rehabilitation will be evaluated on 60 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 60 patients that suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) that underwent an comprehensive rehabilitative. These patients will be matched with subjects that received limited or no rehabilitation rehabilitative therapy. Thus, the total number of subjects in this study will be 240. Subjects will be contacted at least 1 year after discharge and will be lowed up every two-years thereafter for a total period of 10 years. Procedures will be performed in-person whenever possible. However, it is highly likely that the majority of participants will be contacted via phone interviews.\n\nAim 1: Determine if rehabilitation improves vocational status and living status after TBI and CVA.\n\nAim 2: Determine if rehabilitation improves life quality after TBI and CVA.\n\nAim 3: Determine if rehabilitation improves cognitive function after TBI and CVA.\n\nAim 4: Determine if rehabilitative benefits are sustained.\n\nAim 5: Determine if long-term outcome is dependent on the duration of rehabilitation.\n\nAim 6: Determine if long-term outcome is dependent on the nature of the rehabilitative treatment by comparing the effects of different types of rehabilitation. These will include the following: residential-multidisciplinary, day-treatment (i.e. full time multidisciplinary outpatient), outpatient (part-time), skilled nursing and no post-acute rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Long term
