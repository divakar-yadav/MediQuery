Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the Egypt. Despite extensive research, most of the patients die or suffer from varying degree of post-stroke disabilities due to neurologic deficits.\n\nThis registry aims to understand the disease and examine the disease dynamics at the National Level. additionally it aim to introduce an objective method for classifying the registered hospital on a spectrum of 6 level coded with colors (from Black to Green ) according the availability of the predetermined 5 bundles of services presented for patient","detailedDescription":"A clinical registry is an observational database, usually focusing on a clinical condition, procedure, therapy, or population. A stroke registry can be defined as \"an organized system for the collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, and dissemination of information on individual patients who have had a stroke\".\n\nAn ideal stroke registry is nationwide and enrolls patients from as many participating hospitals as possible in order to increase representativeness and avoid selection bias. For example, the Risk-Stroke register in Sweden, launched in 1994, has covered all hospitals that admit acute stroke patients across the country since 1998 . Appropriate data structure and governance policies are needed to keep a nationwide stroke registry sustainable and operating well. Through the publication and communication of results, a stroke registry should be helpful for improvement of stroke care quality, health policy, and the outcomes of patients.\n\nSECRET registry aim to help in the following\n\n1. National Grading of The Presented Stroke Care Services:\n\n   where A 6 levels grading system was designed according to the capability of each service spot (hospital, center, etc.) to present a range of the 5 stroke service bundles of care. each Service Spot (SS) will have one of the following colors according to the availability of the services.\n2. Cost-effectiveness registry Based SOPs SECRET is the first of its type registry to study the parameters for cost/effectiveness analysis for specific steps in the chain of care for stroke patient. The only convincing tool which could be used to approach the politics to be attentive and malleable for changing national plans of healthcare.\n3. Aneurysm Registry This Part of the registry is dedicated for the cerebral aneurysm disorders and their type of clinical presentation. The options of treatment and each option effectiveness and cost outcome.\n\nCFD for Best Medical Treatment Registry To investigate the possible application collected from CFD analysis in special situation to guide physician for best medical treatment (BMT) option for a Neurovascular Disorder."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Cardiovascular","Stroke, Acute","Stroke
