ultrasound in stroke patients who have shoulder pain in weak side.","detailedDescription":"Shoulder pain is a common complication after a cerebrovascular accident.Hemiplegic shoulder pain has been shown to affect stroke outcome in a negative way.It interferes with recovery after stroke:it can cause distress and reduced activities and can markedly hinder rehabilitation.Suprascapular nerve block has been shown to be effective as an analgesic for different indications such as shoulder capsulitis.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique conjunction with a rehabilitation program to reduce shoulder pain in hemiplegic patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Shoulder Pain","Stroke"],"keywords":["suprascapular nerve block","shoulder
