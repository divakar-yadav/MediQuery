All these treatments provide increased physical capacity of the patient. But these are not enough for perform the activity daily living. In order to be successful in activity daily living of the patient, performance based treatment methods should also be applied.\n\nThe use of Canadian Occupational Performance Measurement (COPM), which measures patients' defined problem areas in daily practice should contribute to the patient-oriented approach process.The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is an important tool to enable personalized health care.One of the strengths of the measure is its broad focus on occupational performance in all areas of life, including self-care, leisure and productivity, taking into account development throughout the lifespan and the personal life circumstances.\n\nCOPM has been described as having various advantages in terms of increasing applicability, responsibility and motivation for occupational therapy.There are two focus points in the COPM. The first one is the person-centered; the second is activity performance appropriate to the person's wishes.\n\nBy using conventional methods in stroke rehabilitation, contractures and deformities that may occur in patients can be reduced, muscle strength can be increased, and inadequate gait failure in patients can be minimized.\n\nHowever, in many activities needed for daily living activities, the patient is able to sustain his inadequacy such as dressing, eating, bathing, going to the store. With the application of COPM, deficiencies in patients and the most important needs can be emphasized; thus, a program can be prepared during the treatment process. As the COPM test is a patient-centered test, it has an important place in occupational therapy programs.\n\nIn this study, Frenchay Activities Index, Barthel ADL Index and COPM will be applied in order to focus on the performances that stroke patients need in their daily living activities and to improve the independence of the patients and to emphasize patient-focused treatment. After the tests are applied, the rehabilitation process will be conducted by a treatment plan according to the needs of the patients.After the treatments, the tests will be repeated and the success rate will be evaluated on the patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","occupational therapy","activity daily living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"canadian occupational performance measure (COPM)","description":"COPM has a client-centered design and measures outcomes according to three occupational performance areas (self-care, productivity, and leisure), examining self-perceived changes in the occupational performance of patients through a semistructured interview. The COPM prompts discussion between interviewees and therapists on factors such as different areas of activity, their concerns, and problems to be resolved. At the beginning, patients start by identifying their difficulties according to the three occupational performance areas. They subsequently use a 10-point Likert-type scale, ranging from not at all crucial (1) to extremely crucial (10), to identify the intensity of certain difficulties. For the top five problems or tasks selected by patients, the interviewer asks them to continue identifying their performance and satisfaction with their performance by using the same 10-point rating scale. Accordingly, therapists focus on these main problems or tasks.","timeFrame":"3 weeks interval"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)","description":"The MAS measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity.\n\nScoring:\n\n0: No increase in muscle tone\n\n1. Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion\n2. More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion, but affected part(s) easily moved\n3. Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult\n4. Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension Patients will be evaluated according to the modified ashworth scale described above.\n\nSpasticity of patients with MAS score 2 and below does not affect daily living activities very much.

Each item is awarded a score of 0-3.
