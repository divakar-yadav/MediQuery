If the participant returns for a second period of tDCS and sham with language therapy, the right cerebellum will be stimulated (if it was the only uninfarcted target area investigators will stimulate this area again). For cerebellar stimulation, either anodal or cathodal will be used as studies show that anodal or cathodal stimulation has an effect on cognitive functions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active tDCS plus Speech-Language Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Active tDCS will be applied at the beginning of 45min speech-language therapy session and will last for 20 min.
