The use of cerebral perfusion scintigraphy would predict the course of a stroke. Indeed, it has been shown that a good perfusion is linked to a good evolution of the neurological deficit. This test is used routinely to evaluate cerebral perfusion in patients with stroke. This technique was also used to study the mechanisms of post-stroke aphasia and to highlight neuronal disconnections after stroke, a reflection of the functioning of neural networks.\n\nNeuropsychological tests are almost always done at 3 months. Fatigue is studied: PSF scale at 3 months, 6 months and 2 years. Research needs to be continued in this area because the pathophysiology remains unknown and the symptoms are disabling for patients. Using cerebral perfusion imaging would bring elements of understanding of this mechanism and ultimately improve the management of patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fatigability Post Stroke"],"keywords":["fatigability post stroke","post stroke","high-speed CT","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluate fatigue symptoms in stroke patients","timeFrame":"After the period following a stroke: 1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients: 18 to 60 years old at the initial diagnosis\n* Admission for transient ischemic attack, stroke, dissection, TVC\n* RANKIN less than or equal to 2\n* Neuropsychological tests at +3 months: MoCA\\> 26 (to eliminate cognitive deteriorations too important for the good realization of the battery)\n* Absence of psychiatric history\n* Absence of psychotropic medication\n* No history of stroke\n* No complaint of pre-stroke fatigue\n* Having signed the consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Impossibility of giving the subject or his family enlightened information (subject in emergency situation, difficulties in understanding the subject, etc.)\n* Subject under the protection of justice\n* Subject under guardianship or curatorship\n* Refusal of the patient to participate in the study","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with transient ischemic attack, stroke, dissection, TVC","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Izzie Jacques NAMER, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 75 50","email":"Izzie.Jacques.NAMER@chru-strasbourg.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service de Biophysique et de Médecine Nucléaire","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Strasbourg","zip":"67098","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Izzie Jacques NAMER","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 75 50","email":"Izzie.Jacques.NAMER@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"name":"Izzie Jacques NAMER, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":48.58392,"lon":7.74553}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
