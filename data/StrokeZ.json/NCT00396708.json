Each session will be one hour in length. The length of the study and length of each session is per standard rehabilitation protocol that has been well documented in previous studies as well as the pilot study regarding the AJB. A pre and post test with a 3 month follow up of all measures will be included in the study.\n\nStudy procedures will focus on performing functional tasks using the e100."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)"],"keywords":["Robotics","Rehabilitation","Arm","Stroke","Weakness","Outpatient","Chronic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"myomo e100 neurorobotic elbow brace"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Activity Log"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Arm Function"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function"},{"measure":"SF-36 QOL Survey"},{"measure":"Range of Motion"},{"measure":"Muscle Strength Test"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Medically Stable\n* Cognitive Awareness\n* Weakness in upper arm\n* Over 1 year post CVA\n* not engaged in any other upper arm therapies\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Rashes, open wounds or skin sensitivity on arm\n* Very high elbow tone (arm rigid in flexion or extension)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Kailas N Narendran, BS, MEng","affiliation":"Inventor","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"myomo Inc.","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02129","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Myomo Inc.
