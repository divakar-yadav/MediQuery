The study will develop relationships between the improved motor performance and motor coordination during the locomotor task and the functional effects of the exercise program(e.g., gait variables.)","detailedDescription":"Primary objective of this study is to determine whether a therapeutic exercise program which targets the functional recovery of persons with the post-stroke hemiparesis results in CNS recovery (improved motor coordination). They will determine whether motor coordination during a locomotor task is improved after an exercise program. They will then develop relationships between the improved motor performance and motor coordination during the locomotor task and the functional effects of the exercise program(e.g., gait variables) Overall goal is to develop a more rational basis for the design of stroke rehabilitation programs which target individuals most likely to recover and which are based on physiological principles. This study will supplement an NIH funded randomized clinical trial to evaluate a post-stroke exercise program designed to increase balance, strength, and endurance. Study will include 60-70 prospective patients enrolled in the randomized clinical trial at Kansas University Center on Aging. between Oct 1999 and Oct 2001."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, hemiparesis, CNS, motor coordination"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Procedure: Stroke Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Stroke Rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nFunctionally impaired elderly\n\nExclusion Criteria:","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pamela W.
