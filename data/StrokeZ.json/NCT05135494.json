The experimental group will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the PowerBreath Medic Plus regulated at 75% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values, five times/week over five weeks 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 1 set increasing each week. Both groups will participate in the rehabilitation program and will receive the same dose of physiotherapy, speech therapy and aerobic exercise sessions.

The gold standard treatment for OSA is the use of Positive Airway Pressure, but due to the low adherence to this resource, the multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of OSA is becoming the best therapeutic option. There are few studies evaluating the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in individuals with OSA and the findings regarding the possible effect on Apneia/Hipopneia Index (AHI) reduction are still controversial.\n\nAims:The primary objective of this study is to identify the effects of IMT on the severity of OSA in indivuals after stroke participating in a rehabilitation program. The secondary objectives are to identify effects of IMT on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness and analyze the correlation between severity of OSA and functional independence, inspiratory endurance and pressure.\n\nMethods: For this prospective, sigle blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups. The experimental group will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the PowerBreath Medic Plus regulated at 75% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values, five times/week over five weeks 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 1 set increasing each week.
