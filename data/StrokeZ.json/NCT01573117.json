Hypothermia seems promising also in other acute hypoxic-ischemic or in brain swelling associated cerebrovascular disease. The narrow-time-frame is a major issue (\"time is brain\"). To provide immediate cooling without delay, easy to use, mobile and effective methods are needed. Cold infusions (4 °C) are an accepted standard worldwide. The RhinoChill (BeneChill, USA) is a new device. A comparison of these two induction methods has never been done before. Neither was the effect of cold infusions on brain-temperature measured. For the first time iCOOL 1 compares feasibility, safety and efficacy of the two methods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["hypothermia","induction of hypothermia","cold infusion","nasopharyngeal cooling","stroke","intracranial hemorrhage","cerebrovascular disease","neuro intensive care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cold infusions","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Infusion of 2L cold crystalloid solution (4°C) over 30 minutes","interventionNames":["Drug: Cold crystalloid infusions, 0.9%NaCl or Ringer's solution"]},{"label":"RhinoChill","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Nasopharyngeal cooling with the RhinoChill device (BeneChill, USA)","interventionNames":["Device: RhinoChill"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RhinoChill","description":"Nasopharyngeal cooling with the RhinoChill device","armGroupLabels":["RhinoChill"],"otherNames":["BeneChill, USA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cold crystalloid infusions, 0.9%NaCl or Ringer's solution","description":"Infusion of 2L cold crystalloid solution (4°C) over 30 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Cold infusions"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain temperature","description":"Primary endpoint: Change of brain temperature during one hour after start of cooling.
