This rehabilitation system includes a headband that measures and provides feedback from the brain during rehabilitation, together with tablet-based software. Throughout the 6 week rehabilitation period (as well as in a follow-up session 1 month afterwards) several assessments are taken to understand the effect of this rehabilitation on participant's movement abilities, as well as their brain activity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Axem
