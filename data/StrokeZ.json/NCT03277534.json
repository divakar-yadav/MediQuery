Both groups received 20-minute hand function training twice a week, and the ES group received 40-minute ES on the median nerve of the affected side before each training session. The control group received sham ES - electrodes were placed on the same location but no electric current was applied. EEG, EMG and Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) were collected before, at the 4th week, at the end of 8th week, and 4 weeks after the end of intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["electrical stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Electrical stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Electrical stimulation"]},{"label":"Control","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Sham electrical stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Electrical stimulation","description":"sensory electrical stimulation was applied prior to upper limb functional training","armGroupLabels":["Electrical stimulation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham electrical stimulation","description":"electrodes were placed on the same location as the Electrical stimulation condition, but no electric current was applied","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity","description":"evaluate changes in upper extremity function of the stroke subjects","timeFrame":"before intervention, four weeks after, at the end of the eight-week intervention and four weeks after the intervention period ended"},{"measure":"EEG-EMG coherence","description":"evaluate changes in functional connectivity between motor cortex and active muscles","timeFrame":"before intervention, four weeks after, at the end of the eight-week intervention and four weeks after the intervention period ended"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. first-ever cerebral cortical region involved chronic stroke, onset over a month,\n2. able to perform active thumb flexion on the affected side with the scores of manual muscle test at least two points, and\n3. at stable medical condition for intervention\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. history of other neurological disorders,\n2. cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score \\<24, MMSE),26\n3. unable to follow orders,\n4. contraindications of ES, and\n5. under 20 years old","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
