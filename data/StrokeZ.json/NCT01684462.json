These stroke in acute phase showed neurological deterioration over 50% of the patients after beginning of treatment and the sequelae resulting in that the nervous tissue was not regenerated is regarded as irreversible changes.\n\nThe test group administered 20% albumin based on 1.25g/kg (up to 100g (500ml) over 80kg body weight) to the patients occurred within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms and equal amount of placebo (saline solution (0.9% normal saline)) administered to the control group will be compared to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALbumin for the patients with acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic
