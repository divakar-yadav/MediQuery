Patients are evaluated neurologically with NIHSS scores before treatment administration and at 1 month after the first treatment. Further evaluations at 6 months after treatment by NIHSS and Barthel scores are ongoing","detailedDescription":"Patients with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), ischemic (including those with hemorrhagic transformation), are given a new combination of medications which aims to improve neuronal survival, stimulate mitochondrial genesis and the formation of new synapses. This combination is given as an intravenous perfusion with a 2-hr duration and consists of vitamins B1, B6, B12, C, Actovegin, etc.\n\nBefore treatment a NIHSS score is given. Each patient receives 3-4 such perfusions in 1 month and afterwards another NIHSS score is obtained.\n\nPatients are monitored afterwards and those who show improvements receive more such treatments, and new NIHSS and Barthel scores are obtained.\n\nPatients are grouped on the basis of the time interval between CVA occurence and first treatment:\n\n* Group 1: 0-35 days\n* Group 2: 36-100 days\n* Group 3: 101-360 days Improvement of motor function is compared using NIHSS scores between groups, and between literature and groups"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"The new combination treatment is given to all consecutive patients and compared to literature and between groups (based on the time lapsed between CVA and treatment)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"New Medication Combination","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Combination Product: Perfusion with New Combination Medication Intravenous administration of Actovegin, vitamins B1, B6, B12, C, oxytocin/dexamethasone, calcium gluconate, etc in 250 ml normal saline administered during approximately 2 hours","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Perfusion with New Combination Medication"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Perfusion with New Combination Medication","description":"Intravenous administration of Actovegin, vitamins B1, B6, B12, C, oxytocin/dexamethasone, calcium gluconate, etc in 250 ml normal saline administered during approximately 2 hours","armGroupLabels":["New Medication Combination"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS differential","description":"score differential on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS);
