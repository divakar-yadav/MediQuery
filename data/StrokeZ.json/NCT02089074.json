This randomised controlled trial aims to investigate whether a systematic follow up of drug treatment using medication reconciliation, medication reviews and patient counselling by clinical pharmacists, improves adherence and/or decreases cardiovascular events the first three months and the first year after TIA. Patient satisfaction will also be compared between the two groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Attack, Transient","Stroke"],"keywords":["Secondary Prevention","Pharmacists","Directive Counseling","Medication Adherence","Patient Compliance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":265,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"drug use counselling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pharmacist conducting drug reconciliation, medication reviews and drug use counselling during hospitalisation.
