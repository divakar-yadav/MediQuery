Fast identification of CVA is crucial in order to refer the patient to an appropriate medical center as well as to direct him/her to a suitable treatment upon arrival to the Medical Center, in order to minimize the permanent damage to the brain. In this study, we are evaluating a tool for detecting CVA based on EEG (electroencephalograph) data analysis using innovative algorithm. The system is comprised of four electrodes, reference electrode and earphones for auditory stimulation. In the study, 120 patients arriving to the emergency room with decreased consciousness, severe headaches or dizziness will be monitored for five-minute each, with EEG accompanied with auditory stimulation. The EEG analysis will be performed based on the synchronization of the front and back hemispheres. During CVA, specific hemisphere is damaged, therefore desynchronization is expected. The purpose of this study is to develop a tool for identifying CVA in patients who have no clear CVA related signs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EEG monitoring","description":"Patients arriving to the emergency room with decreased consciousness, severe headaches or dizziness","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: EEG monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"EEG monitoring","description":"Five-minute of EEG monitoring accompanied with auditory stimulation.","armGroupLabels":["EEG monitoring"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Desynchronization Index","description":"Desynchronization Index calculated from EEG data correlation with CVA events","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EEG variablity","description":"EEG variability will be evaluated in correlation to various medical measures (ECG, hypoglycemic state, hypothermia)","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients arriving to the emergency room with decreased consciousness, severe headaches or dizziness\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPregnant women","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients arriving to the emergency room with decreased consciousness, severe headaches or dizziness","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Dana Baron Shahaf, MD PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+972-4-7772487","email":"dana_bs@rambam.health.gov.il"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rambam Health Care Campus","city":"Haifa","country":"Israel","geoPoint":{"lat":32.81841,"lon":34.9885}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003221","term":"Confusion"},{"id":"D000004630","term":"Emergencies"},{"id":"D000006261","term":"Headache"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000010146","term":"Pain"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7486","name":"Emergencies","asFound":"Emergency Room","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9041","name":"Headache","asFound":"Headache","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6136","name":"Confusion","asFound":"Confusion","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12756","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
