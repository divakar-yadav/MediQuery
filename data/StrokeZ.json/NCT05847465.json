Unlike the walk-run test, it is performed under controlled conditions, both environmentally (temperature control, humidity, etc.) and in terms of effort intensity. In addition, there are published interpretation criteria for this test allowing to characterize thermoregulation profiles and to distinguish between Heat Intolerant (HI) and Heat Tolerant (HT) patients.\n\nThe reproducibility of this test and its performance in a climatic chamber allows a true comparison of thermophysiological responses (heart rate, rectal and skin temperatures, skin blood flow and sweat loss), which was not possible with the run-walk test, which was more a field test validating a physical aptitude for recovery (so-called \"occupational\" test) than a physiological exploration evaluating a response to stress by comparing it with the expected response in a population of young, healthy, properly trained subjects. Moreover, the HTT is a much less physiologically demanding test than the 8-km run. The HTT, which corresponds to a 2-hour walk at 5 km/h with a 2% slope at 40°C and 40% relative humidity, is a so-called \"compensable\" thermal stress; that is, under these conditions of exercise and environment, when the individual has normal thermoregulatory capacities, a thermal equilibrium plateau is reached during the second hour, when the individual's thermolysis capacities make it possible to compensate for the production of heat by the exercise and the gain of heat related to the environment. On average, this plateau is between 38° and 39°C. This is clearly not the case with our experience of physiological monitoring of the 8-km walk-run which rarely allows a temperature plateau to be reached and is accompanied by a temperature rise constantly above 39°C. In addition to being performed in the laboratory, this test is therefore completely safe.\n\nFor all these reasons (reproducibility, relevance, predictive value of recurrence), this test has been used for more than 30 years by the Israeli army for the assessment of these cases of exercise heat stroke before their return to work. There is therefore a fair amount of published data and hindsight on the use and interest of this test. The Israeli test has the highest level of recommendation (Grade A) of all the other published heat tolerance tests. Also, the availability of a climatic chamber means that this test can now be proposed as one of the explorations available to clinicians who have to decide on the fitness of soldiers after exercise heat stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heat Stroke"],"keywords":["Heat tolerance
