Patients will be assigned randomly to receive either Methanesulfonic acid cinepazide injection or placebo treatment. All patient in the study will receive standard of care treatment and clinical, diagnostic, laboratory, safety, and follow-up evaluations. Follow-up evaluations, including National Institute of Health stroke scale(NIHSS), Barthel index score and modified Rankin scale assessments, will be done periodically until 90 days after onset.
