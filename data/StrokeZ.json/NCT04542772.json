The incident rate of stroke has been increasing steadily since 1995. The majority of the stroke survivors lose upper extremity function, resulting in diminished activities of daily living (ADL). Many therapeutic interventions are recommended to improve upper extremity function or ADLs of stroke survivors, however, Mirror Therapy (MT), inexpensive intervention, can be self-administered by stroke survivors with intact cognition. Thus, the research question is whether a self-administered MT technique improves acute stroke patients' upper extremity motor function and recovery?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror Therapy + Standard of Care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will receive standard of care based on their needs along with mirror therapy education.","interventionNames":["Other: Mirror Therapy","Other: Regular Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group will receive only standard of care based on their needs.","interventionNames":["Other: Regular Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mirror Therapy","description":"Participants will receive the standard-of-care; multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention based on their needs and tolerance, and will receive an additional 30 min of Mirror Therapy education.
