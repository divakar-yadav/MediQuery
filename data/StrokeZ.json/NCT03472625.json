Tailored medical treatment will be given to each patient considering the type of stroke etc. as is standard of care (e.g. thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy for patients with ischemic stroke). Patients that are stable enough are transferred to the Stroke Unit where the neurologist or attending of the unit will reassess all stroke patients. NIHSS scores will be reported at least at day 2 +/- 1. A dysphagia screening is performed by the Stroke Unit nurses when the patient arrives at the Stroke Unit. The scores of the sub-items language and speech of the NIHSS and the dysphagia screening combined with a general screening by a speech language pathologist will be used to confirm or discard aphasia, dysphagia and dysarthria (incidence). When aphasia, dysarthria and/or dysphagia is confirmed, standardized tests will be performed. For this study, data of the following tests will be included for analysis: ScreeLing and/or BNT (aphasia), NSVO-Z and a perceptual assessment (dysarthria), MASA and/or the FOIS (dysphagia). At day 7 +/- 1, NIHSS scores will be reassessed (recovery in time). The diagnostic assessments and the NIHSS sub-items speech/language will be used to investigate the severity and recovery of the symptoms in time. Reports of the neurological clinical examination at follow-up will be retrospectively investigated if possible for additional information about recovery in time.\n\nThe total duration of data collection will be approximately 1 week and if possible three months follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":557,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute stroke patients","description":"All acute stroke patients will be screened for aphasia, dysarthria or dysphagia.
