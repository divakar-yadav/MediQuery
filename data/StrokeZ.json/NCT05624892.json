Early rehabilitation after stroke accelerates motor-sensory gains of individuals. This also increases the quality of life. Although there are studies on post-stroke rehabilitation in our country, rehabilitation applications with virtual reality application are very limited. For this reason, the research was carried out to determine the effect of home therapy with virtual reality application on motor-sensory gains and quality of life after stroke.\n\nMaterial and method: The research was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study. The universe of the research; Between December 2021 and May 2022, individuals who met the criteria for inclusion in the study who applied for home care to Erzurum Atat√ºrk University Health Application and Research Center Physical Therapy Unit with the diagnosis of loss of movement in the upper extremity after stroke were formed. The sample size for the research was determined by power analysis. In the power analysis, it was determined that a total of 52 people should be reached in order to reach the 95% confidence level at the 0.05 significance level and 80% power at the p\\<0.05 significance level. Considering that there may be data losses in the study, it was decided to reach 60 people, 15% more than the sample. \"Descriptive Feature Form\", \"Brunnstrom Staging\" and \"SF-36 Quality of Life Scale\" were used to collect data.In the analysis of data; percentile distribution, chi-square, Fisher-Freeman- Halton Exact test, t-test in independent groups, Repeated Measures ANOVA Test, Friedman Test, One Way ANOVA test, Kruskall Wallis test, and post hoc analyzes (Bonferroni, Games Howell, Dunn) were used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Syndrome"],"keywords":["Stroke","Home Care","Mirror Therapy","Virtual Reality","Nursing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"In the study, 60 individuals, including 1 experimental and 1 control group, were included in the study.","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Application of mirror therapy to the experimental group with virtual reality application","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Mirror Therapy with Virtual Reality Application"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Application of classical mirror therapy to the control group"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Mirror Therapy with Virtual Reality Application","description":"Researchers will apply Mirror Therapy with Virtual Reality Application to increase individuals' quality of life and motor sense gains.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rehabilitation of the experimental and control groups for 30 minutes 3 days a week for 4 weeks","description":"Individuals in the experimental and control groups were evaluated with the \"Brunnstrom Staging\" and the \"SF-36 Quality of Life Scale\".
