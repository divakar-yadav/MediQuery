The presence of spasticity in the lower extremity implies several impairments for standing and walking inducing high disability. A recent study has proposed the use of dry needling for improving spasticity in the lower extremity. No study has investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into spastic musculature in stabilometry and moto function in patients who had experience a stroke. A randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the inclusion of deep dry needling into a Bobath interventional program on spasticity, motor function and balance (stabilometry) in individuals who had experience a stroke"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Dry needling","Spasticity","Motor function","Stabilometry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dry needling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will receive a single session of Bobath therapy including techniques targeting modulation of central nervous system.
