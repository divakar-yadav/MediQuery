The BBS is a widely used test for the assessment of elderly population with impairment of balance and individuals with neurological disorder while sitting, standing, and transferring. This test included both static and dynamic type task. The BBS uses a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (disability) to 4(complete independent performance) and consists of 14 components; the maximum score is 56 points. The scale has been shown to be reliable and valid in stroke patients. A cut-off score of 45 points is used for fall prediction. The BBS involves 14 tasks; a total score of 56. Equipment required for this test were a stop watch or watch with a second's hand and a ruler or other indicator of 2, 5, and 10 inches.","timeFrame":"Day 3"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go test","description":"Changes from the Baseline, The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was designed for the evaluation of balance and Measures mobility in people who are able to walk on their own (assistive device permitted) to find out the risk of fall . The subjects will be required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. The time taken to complete this task will be measured. The test will be informed three times. The time required to complete this task will be measured from a stopwatch. The average values from 3 trials, with 1-min rest between each trial, were used for data analysis.","timeFrame":"Day 3"},{"measure":"Balance Evaluation Systems Test","description":"Changes from the baseline, Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) is a 36-item assessment of balance impairments across 6 postural control contexts.
