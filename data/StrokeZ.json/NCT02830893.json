LARA facilitates patients in performing a high amount of practice using their moderate to severely impaired upper extremity after stroke.\n\nInvestigators will recruit 44 subjects with subacute strokes to participate in the study through the acute rehabilitation unit of the UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. Study participants will be randomized into 2 groups: LARA therapy group or standard therapy group. The LARA therapy group will use LARA to propel themselves to therapy appointments in the unit and to play video games with the affected upper extremity for 30 mins / day. The standard therapy group will use a standard wheelchair to propel themselves using their unaffected upper and lower extremities. They will be asked to perform a matched duration of standard arm exercises for 30 mins/ day. This program of standard arm exercises was developed by an OT at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago which consists of graded-difficulty table-supported exercises.\n\nThis study will have 3 assessment visits: baseline, 3 weeks after therapy or upon discharge from the acute rehabilitation unit if sooner, and a 3-month follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The LARA Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The LARA arm of this study will use the LARA system while study participants are staying at the acute rehabilitation unit of UC Irvine Douglas Hospital.
