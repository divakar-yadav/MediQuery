Hand disability has a profound negative impact on functional ability and independence. One way to improve hand function is to use peripheral sensory stimulation. Sensory stimulation in conjunction with therapy has been shown to improve motor outcomes more than therapy alone. While promising, most modalities of sensory stimulation interfere with natural hand tasks. To address these practical limitations, we have developed a new stimulation, imperceptible random-frequency vibration applied to wrist skin via a watch. In this study, we will determine if use of this vibration increases hand functional recovery.","detailedDescription":"The study design is a double-blinded randomized controlled study. Subjects will wear the device for at least 8 hours/day every day for a month, during which they will come to the laboratory for weekly evaluation. Follow-up evaluation will occur 3 months after. The device will deliver vibration (treatment) or no vibration (control)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Physical Disability"],"keywords":["physical stimulation","Subliminal
