Mortality rates as high as 40 percent have been reported for stroke as a result of ischemia associated with the carotid distribution. Currently, the primary therapy for carotid artery occlusive disease is carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or the surgical removal of atheromatous material from inside the artery.\n\nAlthough CEA is an effective treatment for the majority of patients with carotid occlusive disease, there remains a need for a treatment option for those patients with significant surgical risk factors. These patients have been shown to have much higher rates of morbidity and mortality. There are approximately 50,000-70,000 patients each year who are considered poor surgical candidates. These patients present with either one or more anatomical or co-morbid conditions and have a one-year stroke and death rate of up to 15% with traditional surgical treatment.\n\nCarotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported by numerous single-center trials to be feasible in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. Moreover, the risk benefit ratio has been suggested to be the largest in those patients with a higher risk profile for the CEA treatment option.\n\nThis trial will study the effects of percutaneous intervention using the Monorail™ Carotid Wallstent® Endoprosthesis (Carotid Wallstent) in conjunction with the FilterWire System distal protection device (FilterWire EX and EZ) on rates of common peri-procedural complications as well as on long-term outcomes as compared to historical outcomes of patients undergoing CEA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Stroke","Cerebral Arteriosclerosis"],"keywords":["Carotid","Carotid Artery Stenting","Stent","Carotid Endarterectomy","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Stenosis","Atherosclerotic Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":747,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: WALLSTENT® Endoprosthesis™"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"WALLSTENT® Endoprosthesis™","description":"Carotid Artery Stent","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary endpoint is one-year morbidity and mortality, defined as the cumulative incidence of any non Q-wave myocardial infarction within the 24 hours following carotid stenting","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"peri-procedural (within 30 days of procedure) death, stroke, Q-wave myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"Within 30 days of Procedure"},{"measure":"late ipsilateral stroke or death due to neurologic events from 31 days up to and including twelve-month follow-up.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Peri-procedural morbidity and mortality","timeFrame":"Within 30 Days of procedure"},{"measure":"FilterWire EX and EZ System technical success","timeFrame":"Post procedure"},{"measure":"Carotid Wallstent technical success","timeFrame":"Post Procedure"},{"measure":"system technical success","timeFrame":"Post Procedure"},{"measure":"angiographic success","timeFrame":"Post Procedure"},{"measure":"procedural success","timeFrame":"Post Procedure"},{"measure":"30-day clinical success","timeFrame":"30 days post procedure"},{"measure":"peri-procedural overall morbidity","timeFrame":"30 days post procedure"},{"measure":"one-year clinical success","timeFrame":"1 Year post procedure"},{"measure":"late stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and death.","timeFrame":"1 year post procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key General Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient must meet criteria for either A or B:\n\nA.

Asymptomatic: Carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 80% via angiography without associated cerebral or retinal TIA or ischemic stroke symptoms within 180 days of the procedure.\n\n* Target lesion is in the native common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), or carotid bifurcation.\n* Target arterial segment to be stented has a diameter of greater than or equal to 4.0 mm to less than or equal to 9.0 mm.\n* Vessel diameter distal to the target lesion is greater than or equal to 3.5 mm and less than or equal to 5.5 mm as an optimal \"landing zone\" for placement of the FilterWire EZ System with visual angiographic recommendations as described in the instructions for use (IFU).\n\nKey High-Risk Eligibility Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must qualify in at least one high-risk category.
