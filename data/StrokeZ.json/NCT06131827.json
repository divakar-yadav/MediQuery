It is most common disease that causes severe disabilities like hemiparesis which is most common motor impairment that leads to persistent upper limb dysfunction. In this study we use two techniques to improve upper limb motor dysfunction and reduce spasticity. One is task-based activities which is used to improve motor function and focus on active participation rather than normal movement pattern and other is neural mobilization which aims to reduce spasticity which is most common in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study will be randomized controlled trial. Participants having stroke past 6 month to 1 year and mini mental state examination score \\>21 will be included in this study. And participants with severe orthopedic deformity, joint pain and visual impairment will be excluded from this study. The sample size will consist of 34 participants selected through non probability convenient sampling technique, which will further be randomized through sealed envelope method and will divide into two groups .Data will be collected using assessment tools, including the Fugl Mayer assessment scale, box and block test and wolf motor function test. 17 Participants will be assigned to the interventional group (A )which will undergo neural mobilization of median nerve with task based activities .Neural mobilization technique will be performed with twenty oscillations per minute being repeated three sets of one minute respecting one minute interval for rest between each set for 4 days weekly for 6 week.\n\nwhile task based activities will be performed with the dosage of 45 minutes session 5 days weekly for 6 weeks and 17 participants will be assigned to control group (B\n\n)which will undergo only neural mobilization of median nerve and will receive neural mobilization with twenty oscillations per minute being repeated three sets of one minute respecting one minute interval for rest between each set for 4 days weekly for 6 weeks. After applying both interventions motor function improvement and spasticity reduction will be measured by using BBT, wolf motor scale and fugl -Meyer assessment scale and data will be analyzed through sPss Version 25."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Neural mobilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neural mobilization","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neural mobilization technique will be perormed with twenty oscillations per minute being repeated three sets of one minute respecting one minute interval for rest between each set for 4 days weekly for Six week.","interventionNames":["Other: Neural mobilization"]},{"label":"Task based activities","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Task based activities consisted of different type of task which will be performed with the doasage of 45 minutes per session 5 days weekly for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Task based activities"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neural mobilization","description":"Neural mobilization will be performed with twenty oscillations per minute being repeated three sets of one minute respecting one minute interval of rest between each set for 4 days weekly for six week","armGroupLabels":["Neural mobilization"],"otherNames":["Task based activities"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Task based activities","description":"Task based activities consisted of different types task which will be performed with the dosage of 45 minute session 5 days weekly for six week.","armGroupLabels":["Task based activities"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Box and block test","description":"It measures unilateral gross manual dexterity","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Wolf motor Function Test","description":"The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) quantifies upper extremity (UE) motor ability through timed and functional tasks","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl -Meyer assessment scale","description":"It measure motor ability of upper extremity","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male and female stroke patients.\n* 6 month to one year post stroke .\n* Age 30-55\n* Stable patients\n* Mini - mental state examination\\>2\n* Modified ashworth Scale equal\\<+1\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Orthopedic deformity\n* Patients undergo bottulinuminjection toxin injection\n* Visual impairments\n* Joint pain (elbow, shoulder, wrist)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Memona Ayesha","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03129601249","email":"memonaayesha66@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Memona Ayesha, Ms-NMPT","affiliation":"Ripha international university","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ripha international university","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Lahore","state":"Punjab","zip":"5433","country":"Pakistan","contacts":[{"name":"Memona Ayesha, Ms-NMPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03129601249","email":"memonaayesha66@gmail.com"},{"name":"Asrar Yousaf","role":"CONTACT","phone":"030040995505","email":"asrar.yousaf@riphah.edu.pk"},{"name":"Asrar Yousaf","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":31.558,"lon":74.35071}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
