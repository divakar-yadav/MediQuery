Multiple Sclerosis (MS), stroke, and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are among the most common apparent neurological diseases, and epidemiological studies show that their prevalence has increased over time worldwide. Although MS, stroke, and PD have different causes and neurological aspects, they generally cause motor, sensory, and/or cognitive impairments, leading to restriction of the individual's activities and participation. Today, physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches together with optimal medical and surgical treatment are the cornerstones of treatment for these diseases. Recently, it has been stated that various telerehabilitation interventions in the field of physiotherapy and rehabilitation may be an additional option to the rehabilitation approaches applied in the clinic. On the other hand, It is important to evaluate the level of usability in expanding the usability of telerehabilitation services and determining the best telerehabilitation service. For this reason, there is a need for questionnaires investigating the satisfaction level of physiotherapy and rehabilitation applied through telerehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Questionnaire items will be created in two stages. First, 5 experts will independently review the literature on \"telerehabilitation\" and \"usability\". In addition, these experts will be asked to create a pool of questions based on their experiences in telerehabilitation and by taking the opinions of patients receiving telerehabilitation about usability. Then, 5 experts will come together and obtain a single question pool containing the questions they deem important in their question pool. The second step will involve scaling the elements. In this study, scale items will be scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1, strongly disagree to 5, strongly agree. Then, it will be applied to a pilot group of 10 people and it will be evaluated whether the items prepared by the experts are understood by the patients. In line with the expert opinion and the result of the pilot study, the final version of the scale will be decided and applied to MS, PD, and stroke patients who make up the study group. Finally, the validity and reliability of the questionnaire will be calculated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurological Disease"],"keywords":["Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson Disease","Stroke","Usability","Telerehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telerehabilitation Usability","description":"Telerehabilitation Usability Group","interventionNames":["Other: Development of the Telerehabilitation Usability Questionnaire"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Development of the Telerehabilitation Usability Questionnaire","description":"This study will be examined the development, validity, and reliability of the Telerehabilitation Usability Questionnaire in patients with MS.","armGroupLabels":["Telerehabilitation Usability"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Telerehabilitation Usability Questionnaire in patients with Neurological disease","description":"Patients get a minimum of 0 points (best condition) and a maximum of 4 points (worst condition) for each question on this scale","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Telerehabilitation Usability Questionnaire in patients with Neurological disease-Second","description":"Patients get a minimum of 0 points (best condition) and a maximum of 4 points (worst condition) for each question on this scale","timeFrame":"he second assessment will be conducted after the one week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Voluntarily participate in research to accept\n* Mini-Mental Test score more than or equal 24\n* Previously receiving physical therapy through telerehabilitation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any visual, hearing, and perception problems that may affect the answering the questionnaire items","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Neurological patients receiving physiotherapy and rehabilitation via telerehabilitation","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Kader Eldemir","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+9 0452 226 52 48","email":"fztkader2015@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Gazi University","city":"Ankara","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":39.91987,"lon":32.85427}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"27563386","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Parmanto B, Lewis AN Jr, Graham KM, Bertolet MH.
