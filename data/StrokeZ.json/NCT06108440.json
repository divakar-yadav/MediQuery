The study will be conducted on 44 stroke patients. The study will be conducted in Civil Hospital Shujaabad and Riphah rehabilitation centre Lahore. Patients will be divided into Group A (n = 20) and Group B (n = 20) using a randomization through computer generated numbers program. Patients in Group A will receive action observation training with conventional treatment. All participants will undergo the training for 25 minutes per session, 5 days per week for 8 weeks. Patients in Group B will receive motor imagery with conventional treatment. All participants will receive interventions for twenty-five minutes per session, five times a week, for eight weeks. For the pre- and post-evaluation of all participants, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA UE) and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) will be used. Data will be analyzed by using SPSS (Statistical package for Social Sciences) 25 version."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis","Motor Activity"],"keywords":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis","Motor Activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be divided into Group A (n = 20) and Group B (n = 20) using a randomization through computer generated numbers program.
