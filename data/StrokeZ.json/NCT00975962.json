Randomization for treatment/not treatment with remote perconditioning takes place during transportation to the hospital. This is because the investigators' hypothesis states that remote perconditioning is neuro-protective and the effect is proportionally larger with early treatment. As the size of the effect is unknown, the investigators will use multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to determine the size of a potential neuro-protective effect.\n\nThe aims of this study are:\n\n1. To describe method of remote perconditioning in clinical practice regarding feasibility. Pros and cons and potential limitations.\n2. To estimate the size of the effect of remote perconditioning in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPa) treatment within four and a half hours of onset of symptoms.","detailedDescription":"Final inclusion and informed consent takes place after first MRI in patients eligible for rtPA.\n\nFollow-up MRI after 24h and 1 month.
