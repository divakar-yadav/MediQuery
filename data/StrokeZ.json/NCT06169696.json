This study aims to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of Neuralis in restoring mobility and independence.\n\nThe device is a discreet EEG headset which specializes in decoding signals from visual cortex, allowing users to initiate precise wheelchair movements through focused attention. This research seeks to demonstrate Neuralis' potential in revolutionizing assistive technology by offering a non-invasive, user-friendly solution for individuals facing motor impairments, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.","detailedDescription":"Neuralis, developed by Synaptrix Labs, is an innovative assistive technology engineered to restore mobility and independence for individuals grappling with severe neuromuscular conditions. This cutting-edge device operates through a discreet and non-invasive EEG headset, comprising strategically placed dry sensors at on the occipital lobe, precisely targeting the visual cortex region.\n\nThe key breakthrough lies in Neuralis' capability to extract brain activity from subtle eye movements. Through this interaction, Neuralis decodes subtle EEG signals, effectively translating them into precise wheelchair navigation commands.\n\nThe device interfaces seamlessly with a user-friendly Neuralis mobile app, serving as the central control hub. This intuitive application handles calibration settings, connectivity, and destination selections through a simplified visual click-based protocol. The slim BCI headset captures EEG data, transmitting it via Bluetooth to the connected smartphone. Subsequently, the data is relayed to a secure cloud server, which houses an advanced computational infrastructure employing edge computing principles for optimal response times.\n\nWithin this cloud environment, a proprietary machine learning pipeline for EEG decoding and intent classification operates. Certain latency-sensitive steps run on the phone, while the cloud handles additional model training and personalization, leveraging scalable processing power. This dynamic architecture ensures a swift and near-instantaneous translation of the user's movement intentions into seamless wheelchair maneuverability.\n\nWhat sets Neuralis apart is its ability to deliver robust functionality in a discreet, user-friendly manner. Its lightweight construction, comprising only four sensors, maximizes comfort while capturing essential visual cortex signals vital for nimble maneuvering. This fusion of advanced neurotechnology and user-centric design positions Neuralis as a significant leap forward in assistive devices, bridging the gap between usability and high-performance functionality for individuals with severe neuromuscular conditions.\n\nNeuralis is completely non-invasive and built from stable, off the shelf parts. All data is encrypted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Disorder","Paralysis","Paralysis; Stroke","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Spinal Cord Injuries","Cervical Spinal Cord Injury","Tetraplegic; Paralysis","Quadriplegia/Tetraplegia"],"keywords":["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Quadriplegia/Tetraplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient Group / Arm","type":"OTHER","description":"Use of non-invasive EEG headband device","interventionNames":["Device: Intervention/Treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intervention/Treatment","description":"Non-invasive EEG headband device","armGroupLabels":["Patient Group / Arm"],"otherNames":["Neuralis by Synaptrix Labs"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Device safety and efficacy","description":"Number of patients who can comfortable and safely use device","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
