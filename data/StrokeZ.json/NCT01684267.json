The focus will be on correcting hip hiking (i.e. exaggerated unilateral upward movements of one side of the pelvis) in post-stroke patients. The human-robot interface will be based on impedance control techniques so that the force-field actuators generate smooth virtual spring/damper restitution forces at the patient's pelvic area.\n\nAs part of the study we will determine whether the force fields applied by the actuated components of the device can effect an acute change in gait biomechanics, primarily pelvis motion during stance and swing phases, in healthy subjects and patients with stroke during ambulation. The investigators will also evaluate the usability of the orthosis in terms of donning \\& doffing, user confidence, and comfort."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait Re-training in Healthy Subjects","Gait Re-training in Stroke Survivors"],"keywords":["Stroke","Gait","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Healthy individuals","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic Gait Rehabilitation (RGR) Trainer"]},{"label":"Post-stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Chronic stroke survivors","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic Gait Rehabilitation (RGR) Trainer"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic Gait Rehabilitation (RGR) Trainer","armGroupLabels":["Healthy","Post-stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pelvic obliquity","description":"Change in pelvic obliquity during gait consequent to force application","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"HEALTHY\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Can walk comfortably on a treadmill\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* any known orthopedic, musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or gait disorder that results in an abnormal gait pattern\n* Females in the second or third trimester of pregnancy\n\nSTROKE\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* single non-traumatic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at least 6 months prior to enrollment\n* persistent hemiparesis, mild spasticity, and residual mild-to-moderate weakness of the lower extremity\n* residual deficits of gait\n* be able to ambulate without the use of assistive devices or assistance of a person\n* able to walk at a comfortable walking speed of \\~0.6 m/s\n* able to walk safely on a treadmill\n* medically stable\n* No other neurological problems, or any known cardiovascular or musculoskeletal disorders that effects their gait or excludes them from exercise\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* unable to attend and follow instructions\n* require physical assistance for ambulation\n* other known orthopedic, musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or gait disorder that results in an abnormal gait pattern\n* severe joint contractures of the hemi-paretic knee\n* females in the second or third trimester of pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02129","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
