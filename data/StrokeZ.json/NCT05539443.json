The study uses a parallel, 2-arm design with 1-to-1 randomization to treatment group. Randomization will be performed at the participant level, stratified by center, age (18-74, 75+), and race (Black/African American, non-Black/African American)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension Secondary"],"keywords":["Hypertension","Hypertension after stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":74,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive Clinic Management (ICM)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Intensive Clinic Management (ICM)"]},{"label":"Intensive tailored telehealth management (ITTM)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Intensive tailored telehealth management (ITTM)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Intensive Clinic Management (ICM)","description":"An in-person clinic management based on the intervention tested among stroke patients in the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial","armGroupLabels":["Intensive Clinic Management (ICM)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Intensive tailored telehealth management (ITTM)","description":"A remote-monitoring blood pressure (BP) management strategy incorporating individualized lifestyle coaching and care planning based on the HyperLink telehealth management trial","armGroupLabels":["Intensive tailored telehealth management (ITTM)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of participants with 3-month SBP control","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3 months","description":"Defined as the SBP at baseline (Visit 1) subtracted from the SBP at 3 months (Visit 2).","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 month"},{"measure":"Mean change in Partners in Health Scale (PIH) score at 3 months","description":"Each of the 11 items on the PIH have eight response options ranging from (0) very good to (8) very poor.
