Recent study found that gut microbiota plays a key role in neurological diseases. Two recent small sample studies reported gut dysbiosis in PSCI patients. In order to further verify the relationship between PSCI and gut microbiota and the predictive value of gut microbiota and serum markers for cognitive impairment and poor prognosis after ischemic stroke. The study intended to collect stool specimens of patients with acute ischemic stroke and assess their cognitive psychological state, and to establish a prospective multi-center follow-up cohort to explore the correlation between the dynamic changes of intestinal flora in patients with stroke and PSCI and poor prognosis of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
