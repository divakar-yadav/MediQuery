In the mean time ,more and more people accept revascularization. There are no prospective studies for comparison of prevention of restenosis after Drug -eluting stents and Bare-metal stents until now.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to observe the following details:\n\n1. Late loss in lumen diameter in follow-up â‰¥50%\n2. Death, non -fatal stroke 30 days after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs\n3. Death, non -fatal stroke 12 months after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs\n\nSecondary endpoint:\n\nbrain, gastrointestinal and urinary system bleeding in 12 months follow-up"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke, restenosis,bare-metal stents, drug -eluting stents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":168,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BMS group, DES group","description":"All the participants in this group will be performed with bare-metal stents or drug -eluting stents","interventionNames":["Procedure: DES group","Procedure: BMS group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"DES group","description":"all the participants in this group will be performed with drug -eluting stents","armGroupLabels":["BMS group, DES group"],"otherNames":["Drug -eluting stents group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"BMS group","description":"all the participants in this group will be performed with bare-metal stents","armGroupLabels":["BMS group, DES group"],"otherNames":["Bare-metal stents group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Late loss in lumen diameter in follow-up â‰¥50%","description":"Late loss in lumen diameter in follow-up â‰¥50%","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Death, non -fatal stroke 30 days after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs","description":"Death, non -fatal stroke 30 days after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Death, non -fatal stroke 12 months after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs","description":"Death, non -fatal stroke 12 months after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet drugs","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"brain, gastrointestinal and urinary system bleeding in 12 months follow-up","description":"brain, gastrointestinal and urinary system bleeding in 12 months follow-up","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- symptomatic posterior circulation ischemia including monor stroke (mRS â‰¤2) or TIA result from the stenosis in the vertebral artery ostium.\n\n70% to 99% stenosis of vertebral artery ostium.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* etiology of stenotic lesions not atherosclerosis patients had undergone previos interventions on the vertebral artery ostium ipsilateral severe stenotic lesions in subclavian artery involved as well as vertebral artery ostium","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Symptomatic status: as evidenced by TIA or non-severe stroke within the past 12 months attributed to 70% to 99% stenosis of vertebral artery ostium are eligible.
