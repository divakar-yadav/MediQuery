These processes are regulated by growth factors, neurotrophines, neurotransmitters, hormones and other factors. Recovery activity can be reflected both in the clinical assessment of the patient (based on the NIHSS or MRS scale for example) as well as on the biochemical and molecular level. This study aims to search biomarkers that prognose brain repair ability and consequently estimate an outcome of stroke patients. The prognostic value of proteins VEGF, IGF-1 and MMP-9 and expression of genes VEGF, IGF-1, MMP-9 is evaluated in association with clinical scales including cognitive assessment scales and depression scales. Furthermore, the collected data will be analyzed in relation to demographics and vascular risk factors. Blood sample collection as well as scales recording are taken at baseline and 3 weeks later after rehabilitation. The study group patients will undergo standard post-stroke rehabilitation programme provided by physiotherapist, every day for a period of 3 weeks with weekend gaps."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","recovery","biomarker","rehabilitation","VEGF","IGF-1","MMP-9"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Subacute ischemic stroke","description":"blood sample collection to determine VEGF, IGF-1 and MMP-9 level in plasma and expression of genes VEGF, IGF-1, MMP-9 in whole blood samples"},{"label":"No ischemic stroke and no other neurological disease control group","description":"blood sample collection to determine VEGF, IGF-1 and MMP-9 level in plasma and expression of genes VEGF, IGF-1, MMP-9 in whole blood samples"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"changes from baseline in IGF-1 level in plasma at 3 week of rehabilitation","description":"IGF-1 is a protein involved in neuroplasticity and angiogenesis processes.
