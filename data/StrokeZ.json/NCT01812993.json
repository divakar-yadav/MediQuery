Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP) positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients with AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and 3 months functional outcomes are assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers respectively. This study will provide data to power a subsequent phase III study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke, sleep apnea, non-invasive ventilatory treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No ventilatory treatment; standard stroke care"},{"label":"Active","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-invasive ventilatory treatment with auto-BPAP plus standard stroke care","interventionNames":["Device: Non-invasive ventilatory treatment with auto-BPAP"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Non-invasive ventilatory treatment with auto-BPAP","armGroupLabels":["Active"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early neurological recovery","description":"Early neurological recovery will be assessed as any improvement on the NIHSS score at 72+12 hours from randomization","timeFrame":"72+12 hours from randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tolerability","description":"Tolerability will be assessed by patients' adherence to auto-BPAP (defined as tolerating the treatment during sleep or somnolence for at least 4 hours continuously)","timeFrame":"During treatment with auto-BPAP; up to 48 hours"},{"measure":"Safety","description":"Safety will be assessed by:\n\n(i) frequency of serious adverse events (i.e., aspiration, aspiration pneumonia defined as combined radiologic, white blood count and clinical findings, respiratory failure with/without intubation) during treatment period that in the opinion of the study physician are causatively and timely (for a maximum of 72 hours from treatment initiation) related to auto-BPAP and all deaths during hospital stay.
