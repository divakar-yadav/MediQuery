There is a great need to develop methods in order to improve the outcome of physical or medical rehabilitation and enhance long-term functional outcome. Many researches' work over the past several years have inspected the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to promote the advantageous effect of neurological rehabilitation.\n\nThe aim of This study Is to compare between the effect of unihemispheric and bihemispheric tDCS on the motor outcome, and spasticity in sub-acute ischemic stroke patients.\n\nThirty sub-acute ischemic stroke patients participated in the study, randomly assigned to one of three groups-tDCS bihemispheric or unihemispheric or sham group. Those patients had stroke in the last 3 months at maximum with NIH stroke score less than 25. ActivaDose tDCS (USA), the only FDA cleared device available for tDCS used in the clinical study to deliver noninvasive brain stimulation, consisted of 20 minutes of 2 mA in each session for twelve sessions three sessions per week. All participants received physiotherapy and rehabilitation therapy was tailored to meet all patients' deficits, and lasted a total of 45 minutes per day, 3 days per week for four weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Lacunar","Hemiparesis","Hemiplegia","Motor Activity","Spastic","Spasticity, Muscle","Hemiplegic Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will participate into the study, each patient will undergo a detailed neurological examination through filling out a medical sheet questionnaire and checking the most common risk factors of stroke and other parameters.

A safe, portable, noninvasive painless, reversible, selective and focal brain stimulation technique, applied by sponge electrodes over the scalp. tDCS is capable of modulating the excitability of targeted brain zones through delivering a sustained direct current (DC), showed altering neuronal membrane potentials based on the polarity of the current. Researchers demonstrated modulating effects of anodal (increases cortical excitability) and cathodal (decreases cortical excitability) tDCS on brain tissue. The expected effects of tDCS brain stimulation exceeds the duration. Animal studies showed neuronal depolarization and increasing neuronal excitability of the anodal stimulation, and opposite results with cathodal stimulation.","armGroupLabels":["Bihemispheric Stimulation Group","Sham Group","Unihemispheric Stimulation Group"],"otherNames":["(tDCS)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)","description":"To assess the upper and lower extremities, motor and sensory recovery assessment.\n\nMaximal attainable score is 226, means a good and functional physical state.","timeFrame":"1 Month"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)","description":"To assess the spasticity within the upper and lower extremities, score ranges from 0-4 with 5 choices. 0 indicates no resistance and 4 indicates rigidity.
