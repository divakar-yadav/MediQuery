The fluid administration can be directed by cardiac output monitoring which evaluate the response to repeated fluid challenge or by preload dependence indices. These indices are not well validated in laparoscopic surgery while pneumoperitoneum can alter venous return or pulmonary compliance.\n\nThe aim of the study is to study the validity of pulse pressure variation to predict fluid response under laparoscopic conditions and to describe the effect of the pneumoperitoneum on the dynamic preload indicators, i.e. the pulse pressure variation, the plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximetry variation and the stroke volume variation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Laparoscopic Surgery"],"keywords":["Preload dependence indices","pulse pressure variation","plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximetry variation","stroke volume variation","laparoscopy","pneumoperitoneum"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"preloaddependence indice after volume expansion in laparoscopy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The measurements of pulse pressure variation, plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximetry variation and stroke volume variation will be performed before pneumoperitoneum at the beginning of the surgery, and will be repeated after pneumoperitoneum insufflation applying each time modification of preload conditions (applying reverse Trendelenburg position followed by Trendelenburg position).
