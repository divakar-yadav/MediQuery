All centers will use the same transcranial Doppler machine for one-hour monitoring with bilateral 2-MHz probes within 24 hours of symptom onset. Recordings will be analyzed for MES by a blinded central reader. The primary aim is to determine the proportion of patients with MES and the association of MES with functional outcomes assessed by a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Infarction, Brain","Embolism","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Infarction","Embolism","Atrial Fibrillation","Ultrasound","Transcranial Doppler"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation","interventionNames":["Other: The presence and rate of MES measured by TCD monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"The presence and rate of MES measured by TCD monitoring","description":"TCD monitoring within 24 hours from the last known well time.
