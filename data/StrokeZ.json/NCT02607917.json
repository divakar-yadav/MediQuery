It is a group randomized design of 24 geographic areas in Minnesota with adjacent states serving as controls.","detailedDescription":"Proposed is a demonstration and implementation project to increase the appropriate use of aspirin for primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in the population of Minnesota. Although significant progress in the reduction of acute myocardial infarction and stroke is apparent, these cardiovascular disorders continue as the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. In recent years, and in the context of the positive results from large randomized clinical trials, there is growing consensus that aspirin, when appropriately used, reduces cardiovascular morbidity in men aged 45-79 and women aged 55-79 years. The use of aspirin for primary prevention was recommended in the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Report in 2009 and more recently in the CDC/CMS 'Million Hearts' ABCs (aspirin, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking) campaign. Aspirin use is also recommended in the Healthy People 2020 goals. However, many adults who would benefit, are not taking aspirin.\n\nThe investigators have been fortunate to receive a large philanthropic donation to launch a campaign to increase appropriate aspirin use in the State of Minnesota. The proposed grant requests funding to evaluate that campaign and the innovative approaches it proposes. In the context of a innovative mass media effort, the investigators intend to test new methods for health system change to increase appropriate aspirin use. Using a two-arm design, the investigators have defined 24 geographic areas in the state that will form the basis for a group-randomized trial. This design will allow us to distinguish the effects of the intervention methods. The interventions will be evaluated by sequential surveys of the target-age general population at baseline and follow-up. Appropriate aspirin use in that population will be the primary goal and endpoint. Simultaneous surveys of adjacent Upper Midwestern states (Iowa, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin) will assess secular trends. Morbidity and mortality data will monitor disease trends and complications associated with aspirin use.\n\nA substantial pilot study in a middle sized community in Northern Minnesota allows us to refine and validate our intervention and measurement methods at the community level. This pilot also demonstrated behavior change of a magnitude supportive of our design assumptions.\n\nThis program, if successful, should result in a generalizable program tested in a real world population setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction","Stroke"],"keywords":["Cardiovascular Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10800,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mass Media plus clinic intervention.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"These geographic areas will receive the media plus clinic intervention over a two year period.","interventionNames":["Other: Mass Media plus clinic intervention."]},{"label":"Media","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"These geographic areas will receive the media intervention over a two year period.","interventionNames":["Other: Media"]},{"label":"No Intervention","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Adjacent states will receive no intervention."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mass Media plus clinic intervention.","armGroupLabels":["Mass Media plus clinic intervention."]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Media","armGroupLabels":["Media"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Appropriate aspirin use.","description":"Aspirin use will be determined by standardized surveys of randomly selected adults.","timeFrame":"4-5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular disease morbidity","description":"Collected from hospital records of the Minnesota Hospital Association.","timeFrame":"4-5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy men age 45-79.\n* Healthy women age 55-79\n* per USPSTF 2009 recommendations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of cardiovascular disease\n* aspirin allergy\n* serious life-limiting illness","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of Minnesota","city":"Minneapolis","state":"Minnesota","zip":"55455","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":44.97997,"lon":-93.26384}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35536579","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Luepker RV, Eder M, Finnegan JR, Van't Hof JR, Oldenburg N, Duval S.
