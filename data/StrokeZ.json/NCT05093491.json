Healthy volunteers and stroke patients who are planned to be hospitalized in the Stroke clinic for rehabilitation in Istanbul Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital are evaluated and included in the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nDemographic data of patients (gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, comorbidity status, smoking/alcohol use, dominant extremity, stroke etiology, duration, side), functional status (Brunnstrom stages, Functional Ambulation Scale (FAS), Daily Living Activity (ADL) Index), Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) measurement results and bilateral diaphragm and abdominal muscle thicknesses and thickening ratio in ultrasonography, demographic data of healthy volunteers (gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, comorbidity status, smoking/alcohol use, dominant side), PFT measurement results and the dominant side diaphragm and abdominal muscle thicknesses and thickening ratio in ultrasonography is done and included in the study.\n\nIn the ultrasonographic evaluation of the participants, using a 7-12 Mhz linear Probe, measurements are made of the diaphragm at the end of tidal expiration and forced inspiration, abdominal muscles at the end of tidal expiration and at the end of forced expiration, while all respiratory muscles are lying in the supine position. Diaphragm thickness is measured between the 8th and 9th ribs at the level of the anteroaxillary line, rectus abdominis; 4 cm lateral of the umbilicus, transversus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique muscles' measurement is made from the middle of the lowest part of the 12. rib and the highest point of the iliac crest and 2.5 cm in front of the midaxillary line. All measurements are repeated 3 times and the average value will be recorded.\n\nVital capacity\\[VC\\], forced vital capacity \\[FVC\\], forced expiratory volume 1 second \\[FEV1\\] , FEV1/FVC, maximal expiratory flow rate \\[PEF\\], maximum inspiratory pressure \\[MIP\\] maximum expiratory pressure \\[MEP\\] in patients' PFT \\] measurement results are checked.\n\nIntragroup and intergroup data are compared."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Respiratory Muscle","Pulmonary Function Test"],"keywords":["stroke","pulmonary function","ultrasound","respiratory muscle thickness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Ultrasonographic measurements were performed of the bilateral diaphragm and abdominal muscle thickness and thickening ratio of stroke patients.
