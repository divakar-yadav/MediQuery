The function WBPA works as adding pulses to the circulation. This motion increases shear stress to the endothelium, which stimulates increased release of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (eNO), prostaglandin E-2, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) into the circulation, and these substances are cardioprotective and contribute to vasodilatation. The WBPA were not well studied than whole body vibration (WBV), a vertical rocking training machine, and most researches focused on cardioprotective effects. A study revealed the effect of Moderate-Intensity Exercise and Whole-Body Periodic Acceleration on Nitric Oxide release was the same. This instrument is quite safe and was applied to patients with varied diseases in previous study. No sound contraindication was mentioned till now.\n\nOur hypothesis is assuming that the circulation of brain could improve after the intervention of WBPA, and stroke recovery and cadio-pulmonary function will improve subsequently.","detailedDescription":"So the investigators will recruit subacute stroke patients as our subjects. The patient who is booked to our rehabilitation ward for further rehabilitation programs is eligible for our study. the investigators will recruit 30 patients, and randomize them to experimental and control group. This study is going to be single blinded, which the evaluator is blinded to the condition of the subjects. Whether experimental or control groups will received the same intensive rehabilitation programs (6 days a week). The experimental group will receive additional WBPA treatment. The duration will be 30 minutes a time, and the frequency will be 5 days a week, and the treating period will be 3 weeks. The evaluator will assess twice, before and after the experiment period. The measurements include: muscle power, brunnstrom stages, Barthel Index, functional independence measure (FIM), time up and go test, 6 minutes walk test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, berg balance scale, cardio-pulmonary test. In addition, to confirm the immediate effect of WBPA over brain circulation, the investigators will choose 6 patients to received carotid ultrasonography before and immediately after the WBPA treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"With WBPC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intensive rehabilitation programs :The duration will be 30 minutes a time, and the frequency will be 5 days a week, and the treating period will be 3 weeks additional WBPC: The duration will be 30 minutes a time","interventionNames":["Device: WBPC"]},{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intensive rehabilitation programs: The duration will be 30 minutes a time, and the frequency will be 5 days a week, and the treating period will be 3 weeks without WBPC.","interventionNames":["Device: Without WBPC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"WBPC","description":"The duration will be 30 minutes a time, and the frequency will be 5 days a week, and the treating period will be 3 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["With WBPC"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Without WBPC","description":"Not treat with WBPC","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional independent measurement(FIM)","description":"Score from 18 to 126, assessment of degree of disability depends , 18 categories(score from 1\\~7 points, 1 = \\<25% independence; total assistance required, 7 = 100% independence), focusing on motor and cognitive function, Represent post-stroke patient's ADL function","timeFrame":"up to 3 weeks"},{"measure":"Brunnstrom stage,","description":"Stage I to V, stage I: flaccid ; stage II: spasticity appeared, associated movement; stage III: increased spasticity, synnergy movement; stage IV: decreased spasticity, breaking synergy; stgae V:most independent movement; stage VI: normal.
