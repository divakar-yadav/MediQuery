Treatment will be double-blinded (neither the patient nor study staff will know which study drug is assigned to patients during the study). Patients assigned to rivaroxaban will receive rivaroxaban 20 mg orally (p.o.) once daily (OD) plus warfarin placebo p.o. OD titrated to a target sham international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5. Patients with moderate renal impairment at screening will receive rivaroxaban 15 mg p.o. OD. Patients assigned to warfarin will receive warfarin p.o. OD titrated to a target INR of 2.5 plus rivaroxaban placebo p.o. OD.
