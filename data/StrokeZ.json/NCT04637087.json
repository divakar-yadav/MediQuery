The specific objective is to develop and implement a rational and personalized approach to AF risk estimation that can inform management decisions with ischemic stroke. The investigators propose to develop a clinical AF risk estimation tool in the electronic health record and to test the effectiveness of implementing a clinical AF risk estimation tool into care for use by stroke neurologists during the care of acute ischemic stroke patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. The investigators will evaluate cardiac monitoring utilization calibrated to AF risk by stroke neurologists using a custom electronic health record (EHR) notification module.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that cardiac rhythm monitoring utilization will be positively correlated with the predicted risk of AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atrial Fibrillation Risk Estimation Tool","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For eligible patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke, a clinical atrial fibrillation risk estimation tool will be displayed in the patient's electronic health record through a best practice alert (BPA).
