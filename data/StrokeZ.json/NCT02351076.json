Flow detection syst√©m is a new method for right to left shunt detection comfortable for patients, not dependent on experienced examinator and only one method with exact valsalve maneuver measurement. Right to left shunt could be important etiology of cardioembolization in young stroke patient population, therefore screening for this condition is recommended in all young patient after ischemic stroke especially with unclear etiology. Flow detection systes seams to be ideal screening method for this patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Foramen Ovale Patent"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"detection of right-to-left shunt","description":"Correletation of right-to-left shunt detection by 3 methods: transesophageal echocardiography, transcranial Doppler with contrast agent (microbubbles) and Flow detection system (Cardiox TM)","timeFrame":"1 week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:ischemic stroke / TIA, signed informed consent -\n\nExclusion Criteria:imposibillity to undergo transesophageal echo, transcranial doppler with contrast or Cardiox flow detection system\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient after ischemic stroke including TIA, age 18-55 year","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Martin Kuliha, MD","affiliation":"University Hospital Ostrava","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Ostrava","city":"Ostrava","zip":"70200","country":"Czech Republic","geoPoint":{"lat":49.83465,"lon":18.28204}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000054092","term":"Foramen Ovale, Patent"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000006344","term":"Heart Septal Defects, Atrial"},{"id":"D000006343","term":"Heart Septal Defects"},{"id":"D000006330","term":"Heart Defects, Congenital"},{"id":"D000018376","term":"Cardiovascular Abnormalities"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000000013","term":"Congenital Abnormalities"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27260","name":"Foramen Ovale, Patent","asFound":"Foramen Ovale Patent","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9122","name":"Heart Septal Defects, Atrial","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9121","name":"Heart Septal Defects","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9108","name":"Heart Defects, Congenital","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12","name":"Congenital Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20193","name":"Cardiovascular Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"}]}},"hasResults":false}
