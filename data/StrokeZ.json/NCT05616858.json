However, stroke survivors have shown a passive attitude towards the exercise program and there was little guideline and experience of the stroke exercise program in the community. Therefore, the study provides patients with an adequate guide to a complex exercise program after discharge based on the medical records."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Sports Physical
