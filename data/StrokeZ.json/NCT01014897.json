The experimental protocol will not alter standard of care, will be performed after standard rehabilitation is completed. The experimental therapy is not part of standard care and will not be charged or reimbursed by the patients' insurance. Participation will be free of charge for subjects.\n\nWe were planning to perform the study in two phases. In the first exploratory phase, we will conduct a short pilot study with 15 subjects to optimize and if possible simplify the treatment parameters for the second longer phase of the experiment. In this first phase we will perform one of the four different tDCS stimulation conditions concurrently with the physical therapy protocol on each therapy day, so that all subjects will receive all stimulation types in a randomized counterbalanced order. There will be a 1 day rest period in between sessions, making 9 days (10 days if initial evaluation is done on the day before the 1st treatment) the total commitment time for the first phase of study.\n\nThe outcome measures were collected before and after each session. The outcome measures collected after the 1 day rest provide the baseline for the next session will be also used as to validate the stability of the treatment effect. Subjects participating in the first part of the study will be offered the option to participate in the second longer phase of the study. (please see table under study procedures)\n\nIn the second phase of the experiment we will perform only the promising stimulation paradigms plus sham from the first part of the experiment in a random, counterbalanced order on up to 30 chronic stroke subjects. If in the initial phase there are no differences found between stimulation types in the cortical vs subcortical patient groups then all 3 stimulation paradigms will be performed in the second phase.\n\nBased on our preliminary data, we will perform the following paradigms in the second phase: 1) sham 2) dual stimulation 3) optimized tDCS in a randomized counterbalanced order. The optimized tDCS will be determined during a test session prior to the first treatment where the tDCS montage producing the best behavioral response will be used during therapy. Subjects will perform this under IRB approved study # STU 102013-085.\n\nThe patient time commitment in the second phase is 18 weeks, where subjects will have 3 x 1 weeks long treatment (5 weekdays) sessions with 5 week inter-treatment \"rest period\". The blinded tester will perform a final outcome evaluation 5 weeks after the end of the last session. (please see table under study procedures)\n\nTotal number of potential enrolled subjects for both phases will be approximately 45 \\[Phase 1 (15) + Phase 2 (30)\\].\n\nThe stepwise design will enable us to optimize study time commitment and expenses for both patients and researchers while maximizing clinical/scientific gain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","recovery","tDCS","direct current","electric stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"subcortical","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subcortical stroke patients will receive tDCS stimulation and sham in random order","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]},{"label":"cortical","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"subjects will receive active and sham tDCS in random order","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"tDCS and sham will be applied in random order during standardized occupational therapy","armGroupLabels":["cortical","subcortical"],"otherNames":["transcranial direct current stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function test","description":"The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is a quantitative index of upper extremity motor ability examinable through the use of timed and functional tasks.
