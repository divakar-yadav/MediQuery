By measuring muscle activity in the wrist and finger flexors and extensors, the research seeks to understand the impact of MI and AO on motor function recovery post-stroke. Conducted at the University of Salamanca, the study involves stroke survivors participating in a series of three experimental sessions. The analysis will correlate electromyographic responses with functional independence, limb functionality, and cognitive factors. The research aims to contribute to the fields of occupational therapy and physiotherapy, offering insights into effective rehabilitation methods for improving quality of life in stroke survivors.","detailedDescription":"This study investigates muscle activation in the upper limbs of stroke survivors using electromyographic analysis during Motor Imagery (MI) and Action Observation (AO). Stroke, a major cause of disability, often results in motor impairments in the upper limb, impacting daily activities. The research focuses on innovative rehabilitation techniques based on neuroplasticity, such as MI and AO, stimulated by the discovery of mirror neurons.\n\nThe primary goal is to record upper limb muscle activation during MI and AO, using surface electromyography to measure activation in wrist and finger flexors and extensors. The study will also explore the relationship between electromyographic responses and factors like daily activity independence, limb functionality, quality of life, mental evocation ability, and cognitive impairment.\n\nConducted at the University of Salamanca, the study will recruit stroke survivors for a three-session experimental protocol involving control, MI, and AO conditions. Data will be analyzed with SPSS Statistics, ensuring anonymity and ethical compliance. The research aims to enhance understanding of effective neurorehabilitation techniques, contributing to the fields of occupational therapy and physiotherapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Quality of Life","Mirror Movement"],"keywords":["Stroke rehabilitation","Electromyography","Neuroplasticity","Upper Linb","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Patients will receive 3 interventions: placebo, motor imagery and action observation"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will receive 3 experimental procedures\n\n1.
