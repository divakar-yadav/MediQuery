The difference in the interaction between Caucasian and African American adolescents will also be examined. This may play a role in the differing rates of heart disease and diabetes between the two groups.","detailedDescription":"Purpose: The purpose of the research is to learn more about how the lining of arteries in the body (called the endothelium) and insulin work in adolescents. Abnormalities in how the blood vessels and insulin work in adolescents may cause high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease.\n\nHealthy adolescents between 8 and 18 years of age are being studied in the Ohio State University General Clinical Research Center. Two visits will be necessary. One will be a screening visit to determine the child's stage of puberty and obtain a medical history. The second will be the study visit. During the latter, blood vessel function will be determined by studying the change in forearm blood flow before and after blood flow to the forearm is stopped. Insulin sensitivity will be determined using glucose water given into a vein."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Hypertension","Heart Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["insulin sensitivity","endothelial function","adolescence","lipids","puberty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Caucasian Adolescents","description":"Caucasian Adolescents"},{"label":"African-American Adolescents","description":"African-American Adolescents"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Caucasian or African American adolescent\n* Between 8 and 18 years of age\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy\n* Chronic Disease\n* Acute Disease\n* Medication Requirement","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"8 Years","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adolescents","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Robert P Hoffman, MD","affiliation":"Ohio State University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ohio State University","city":"Columbus","state":"Ohio","zip":"43210","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.96118,"lon":-82.99879}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18221434","type":"RESULT","citation":"Hoffman RP.
