The main question it aims to answer is:By using intelligent portable isokinetic tester and traditional isokinetic tester, isokinetic knee flexor and extensor muscles of stroke patients with hemiplegia were trained respectively, so as to observe and compare the effects of the two treatment methods. In addition, the therapeutic effect of the above two treatments was compared with that of exercise therapy alone. Participants will be divided into three groups: control group, intelligent isokinetic treatment group, and traditional isokinetic treatment group. Participants of both the control group and the two treatment groups received exercise therapy. On the basis of exercise therapy, participants of the intelligent isokinetic treatment group used the intelligent portable isokinetic tester to train the affected knee flexion and extensor muscle, while the participants of traditional isokinetic treatment group used the intelligent portable isokinetic tester to train the affected knee flexion and extensor muscle."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Rehabilitation; Tobacco Use","Physical Disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group received exercise therapy (once a day, 40min/ times, 5 times/week), occupational therapy (once a day, 30min/ times, 5 times/week), low-frequency electricity (once a day, 20min/ times, 5 times/week), acupuncture therapy (once a day, 20min/ times, 5 times/week) .","interventionNames":["Other: without test training"]},{"label":"Traditional isokinetic treatment group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The treatment machine adopts the traditional isokinetic training machine, the treatment items and the treatment parameters are the same as the intelligent isokinetic treatment group.","interventionNames":["Device: isokinetic muscle strength test training","Other: without test training"]},{"label":"Intelligent isokinetic treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the intelligent isokinetic treatment group, isokinetic muscle strength training of hemiplegic lower limb flexion muscle group and knee extension muscle group was added to the treatment of the control group.\n\nIntelligent isokinetic treatment to increase the above treatment hemiplegic lower limb flexion, knee extension muscle isokinetic strength training.
