Data from patients will be transferred to VISTA in a real time or at most, weekly basis and comparative group patients will be prospectively matched throughout the recruitment period. The VISTA investigators will be blinded to treatment group when receiving data from BrainsGate. The VISTA investigators will match each recruited BrainsGate patient with 3 patients from the VISTA archive. The matching criteria will include age ± 4 years; baseline NIH score matched exactly, and side of infarct.\n\nIn addition, to the end of treatment visit, in which implanted patients will undergo a device removal procedure, two follow-up visits will be performed. The visits should be performed at 30±5, and at 90±5 post enrollment. Aggregate trial duration will be \\~100 days per patient, and the overall study duration will be up to 18 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stricture of Intestine"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Treatment","ISS","ImpACT","clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":98,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Implant will be implanted using a minimal invasive approach.
