The tCES has been applied in clinical trials related to rehabilitation research in recent years, and the safety and effectiveness have also been established. However, the existing tCES products effect on the whole brain networks and lack special waveforms. We developed a wearable high-definition tCES (HD-tCES) with special waveforms. This novel stimulation system will result in more precise and focal stimulation of selected brain regions with special waveforms to display better neuromodulation performance. In this study, we will preliminarily examine the effects and safety of the HD-tCES on lower extremity in patients with stroke. We expect that the HD-tCES combined with the lower extremity rehabilitation can shorten the duration of rehabilitative periods, improve stroke patients' activity of daily living, reduce the care burden of patients' family, and subsequently decrease the cost of health care insurance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, Transcranial electrical stimulation, Lower-limb rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HD-tCES & lower limb rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experiment group will receive HD-tCES combined with lower limb rehabilitation of affected side.","interventionNames":["Device: HD-tCES","Other: Lower limb rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Sham HD-tCES & lower limb rehabilitation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham control group will receive sham HD-tCES combined with lower limb rehabilitation of affected side.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham HD-tCES","Other: Lower limb rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"HD-tCES","description":"The high definition transcranial electrical stimulation was applied using a 1\\*4 ring electrode configuration.
