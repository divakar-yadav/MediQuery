Recently completed randomized trials of cardiac monitoring following stroke have established that PAF is more common than previously recognized in cryptogenic stroke.\n2. The majority of TIA/stroke patients will have at least one potential stroke mechanism identified by the time etiologic investigations completed.\n3. Detecting PAF in patients with strokes with known causes (eg. lacunar and large vessel atherosclerosis) is clinically important since appropriate anticoagulation for AF reduces stroke recurrence in all patients with prior TIA/stroke not just cryptogenic strokes.\n4. There are competing technologies for evaluating cardiac rhythm and diagnosing AF but no cost effectiveness data\n5. The rates of PAF in strokes with known causes (SKC) have not been well characterized.\n\nPER-DIEM is a pilot study to compare two different cardiac monitoring technologies as first-line investigations to detect PAF in patients with recent stroke and TIA. The study will also assess whether a pivotal trial is feasible and warranted.\n\nThe principal research questions to be addressed in this study will be:\n\n1. Whether implantable loop recorder (ILR) plus remote monitoring will diagnose more paroxysmal AF / atrial flutter and provide a better assessment of the total burden of AF resulting in a greater proportion of patients started on an OAC versus the external loop recorder (ELR) strategy.\n2. What is the relative cost-effectiveness as a first-line investigation of long-term implantable ECG (ILR) coupled with remote monitoring for 12 months compared to external event-triggered ECG loop recorder (ELR) for 30 days in the diagnosis clinically actionable AF in following TIA/stroke.\n\n2) What is the feasibility, patient compliance, diagnostic accuracy and rates of AF detection (\\>30 seconds) of ILR compared to the ELR strategies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation","Arrhythmias, Cardiac"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","atrial fibrillation","etiologic investigations","secondary prevention","anticoagulation","arrhythmias","embolic stroke, undetermined etiology","implantable loop recorder","external loop recorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Implanted Loop Recorder","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"long-term implantable ECG (Medtronic Reveal LINQ) coupled with remote monitoring (MyCareLink) for 12 months","interventionNames":["Device: Medtronic Reveal LINQ"]},{"label":"External Loop Recorder","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"external event-triggered ECG loop recorder (Sorin Spiderflash-t) for 30 days","interventionNames":["Device: Sorin Spiderflash-t"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Medtronic Reveal LINQ","armGroupLabels":["Implanted Loop Recorder"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sorin Spiderflash-t","armGroupLabels":["External Loop Recorder"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of clinically actionable AF","description":"The primary outcome will be the rate of detection of an atrial arrhythmia (AF / atrial flutter) that results in initiation of additional anti-platelet or OAC therapy as per usual clinical practice.","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of clinically actionable AF or death","description":"The first secondary outcome will be the composite of detection of an atrial arrhythmia (AF / atrial flutter) that results in initiation of additional anti-platelet or OAC therapy as per usual clinical practice or death (whichever occurs first).","timeFrame":"12, 24, 36 months"},{"measure":"Compliance","description":"Compliance with assigned therapy (accept ILR, conduct at least 80% of ELR assessments)","timeFrame":"30 days, 12 months"},{"measure":"Costs of cardiac and non-cardiac investigations","description":"Costs for all cardiac and non-cardiac investigations related to etiologic workup of index stroke / TIA.","timeFrame":"12, 24, 36 months"},{"measure":"Duration of any detected atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter.","description":"Total duration of any detected atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter.","timeFrame":"30 days, 6 months, 12, 24, 36 months"},{"measure":"Study related adverse events / serious adverse events.","description":"Study related adverse events / serious adverse events.","timeFrame":"30 days, 6, 12, 24, 36 months"},{"measure":"Ischemic stroke / TIA, death, hemorrhagic stroke, major adverse bleeding, or death.","description":"Clinical recurrence of ischemic stroke / TIA, death, hemorrhagic stroke, major adverse bleeding, or death.","timeFrame":"30 days, 6, 12, 24, 36 months"},{"measure":"Clinical silent strokes, microbleeds, white matter disease","description":"Relationship between duration detected AF and clinically silent strokes, volume of leukoaraiosis, numbers of cerebral microbleeds","timeFrame":"12, 24 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Predictors of AF detection","description":"Association between baseline clinical characteristics (e.g. comorbidities, burden of supraventricular ectopy on Holter, left atrial dimension) and subsequent detection of AF","timeFrame":"12, 24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of the index event\\* made by a stroke specialist of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA occurring within the previous 90 days.
