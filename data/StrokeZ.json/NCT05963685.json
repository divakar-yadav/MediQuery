The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the implementation of a standardized alarming system associated with shorter transfer and treatment times?\n* Is the implementation of a standardized alarming system associated with a better adherence on existing standard operating procedures for interhospital transfer? We will analyze data from our existing thrombectomy registry comparing time periods before and after introduction of the MT alarming system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic
