High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke. It is important to control high blood pressure after a stroke to prevent another one from happening. We will use the Withings Smart Blood Pressure Monitor for daily blood pressure measurements.\n\nTracking of blood pressure measurements will be done via iPod Touch equipped with internet connectivity. We hope to learn if this method of managing blood pressure is more effective than the standard way of having patients visit primary care physicians (the control group for this study). We will also get feedback from participants who will receive the Withings Smart Blood Pressure Monitor about the ease of use and overall satisfaction with this blood pressure device. People 18-100 years old who have had a stroke in the past 6 months may join. You will be excluded from the study if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant in the near future."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: Primary Care Physician Management of blood pressure"]},{"label":"Blood Pressure Monitor","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Device: Withings Smart Blood Pressure Monitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Primary Care Physician Management of blood pressure","description":"* You will receive a 30-minute education session about your blood pressure medications and the need to take them every day.\n* Your primary care physician will make recommendations on your optimal target blood pressure range and medication recommendations. .","armGroupLabels":["Conventional"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Withings Smart Blood Pressure Monitor","description":"We will use the Withings Smart Blood Pressure Monitor for daily blood pressure measurements.","armGroupLabels":["Blood Pressure Monitor"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood pressure","description":"The blood pressure will be obtained on Day 90 by measuring three consecutive times and obtaining an average.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Stroke in 90 days","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* People 18-100 years old who have had a stroke in the past 6 months may join.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* You will be excluded from the study if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant in the near future.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Johns Hopkins Hospital","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21287","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000006973","term":"Hypertension"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11997","name":"Neoplasm Metastasis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","asFound":"Hypertension","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
