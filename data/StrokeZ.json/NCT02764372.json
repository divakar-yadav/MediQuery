A secondary objective was to provide preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy of the approach in increasing arm activity and health related quality of life of persons post stroke or with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nA pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out in an inpatient and ambulatory care at a rehabilitation center. Twenty persons with multiple sclerosis (n=16) or chronic poststroke (n=4) receiving rehabilitation at the center, able to flex shoulder and elbow at least 45 degrees, participated in the study.\n\nAn intervention group received Serious Games-based upper extremity therapy for a total of 12 sessions (4-5 sessions, lasting 40 minutes, per week) and the control played the same amount of time with commercial exergames of the Wii. Both groups received their usual rehabilitation services as well as game playing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Arm rehabilitation","Serious games","stroke","Multiple sclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Serious games","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group received Serious Games-based upper extremity therapy through Kinect","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Serious games"]},{"label":"Exergames","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control played the same amount of time with commercial exergames of the Wii","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Exergames"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Serious games","description":"Participants played serious games developed for Kinect in the the EU FP7 STREP Project REHAB@HOME N. 306113","armGroupLabels":["Serious games"],"otherNames":["virtual reality games"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Exergames","description":"Participants played exergames existent in the Wii game console","armGroupLabels":["Exergames"],"otherNames":["Wii game console"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"9 Hole peg test","description":"Testing pre and post intervention","timeFrame":"10 months"},{"measure":"Box and Block test","description":"Testing pre and post intervention","timeFrame":"10 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Short Form 12","description":"Testing pre and post intervention","timeFrame":"10 months"},{"measure":"the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS)","description":"Testing pre and post intervention","timeFrame":"10 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persons Post stroke or with MS with resultant upper extremity motor deficits.\n* Range of motion of shoulder and elbow equal or higher than 45 degrees.\n* Able to comprehend and follow directions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Wearing pace maker\n* Comorbidities affecting arm use\n* Not able to comprehend and follow directions","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009103","term":"Multiple Sclerosis"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000012598","term":"Sclerosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020278","term":"Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases, CNS"},{"id":"D000020274","term":"Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System"},{"id":"D000003711","term":"Demyelinating Diseases"},{"id":"D000001327","term":"Autoimmune Diseases"},{"id":"D000007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11750","name":"Multiple Sclerosis","asFound":"Multiple Sclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15105","name":"Sclerosis","asFound":"Sclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4319","name":"Autoimmune Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21788","name":"Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases, CNS","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21784","name":"Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6599","name":"Demyelinating Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9890","name":"Immune System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
