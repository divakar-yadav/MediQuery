This will be an open label trial and thus all participants will receive the active rTMS intervention.","detailedDescription":"The primary objectives of this project are as follows:\n\n1. To assess the efficacy TMS in PSD. We hypothesize that there will be a decrease in the HAMD score in patients receiving TMS\n2. To assess the feasibility of an accelerated protocol using rTMS in patients with acute to subacute stroke and co-existing PSD. We hypothesize that the accelerated protocol will promote compliance in our patient population and that the administration of this intervention is feasible.\n3. To assess the safety of rTMS in patients with acute to subacute stroke. We hypothesize that the side effects of TMS will be minimal and the therapy will be well-tolerated and safe in individuals with recent strokes and co-existing PSD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open label","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Open label single arm study to determine safety and effectiveness of TMS for post stroke depression","interventionNames":["Device: TMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"TMS","description":"NeuroStar TMS Therapy","armGroupLabels":["TMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"After Day 1 of rTMS treatment"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"After Day 2 of rTMS treatment"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"After Day 3 of rTMS treatment"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"After Day 4 of rTMS treatment"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"3 months following neurostimulation"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"6 months following neurostimulation"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"12 months following neurostimulation"},{"measure":"Depressive Symptoms as Rated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale","description":"Depressive symptoms as rated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
