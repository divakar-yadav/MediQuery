Efficacy evaluation of amlodipine folic acid tablets:\n\n   To assess the effects of amlodipine folic acid tablets 5.8 mg (5 mg amlodipine + 0.8 mg folic acid)versus amlodipine tablets 5 mg in preventing all-cause stroke in cerebral small vascular disease (CSVD) patients with hypertension and elevated homocysteine (Hcy) level.\n2. Intensive Antihypertensive Therapy:\n\nTo assess the effect of intensive antihypertensive therapy (SBP\\<130 mmHg) versus standard antihypertensive therapy (SBP 130-\\<140 mmHg) in reducing risk of combined cardio-cerebrovascular events in CSVD patients with hypertension and elevated Hcy level, using two basic anti-hypertensive drugs, amlodipine tablets 5 mg or amlodipine folic acid tablets 5.8 mg.","detailedDescription":"Hypertension is highly prevalent risk factor for stroke, particularly for stroke associated with CSVD. Blood pressure (BP) lowering has been considered an important measure for preventing stroke and progression of CSVD. Moreover, uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy of folic acid therapy for secondary prevention of stroke because of limited and inconsistent data. We propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 2×2 factorial designed clinical trial to test the primary hypothesis that 1) whether amlodipine folic acid is more effective than amlodipine in reducing the risk of all-cause stroke (including fatal and non-fatal stroke) over a follow-up period among patients with CSVD. 2) whether an intensive treatment strategy (a systolic BP target of \\<130mmHg) is more effective than a standard treatment strategy (a systolic BP target of 130-140mmHg) in reducing the risk of combined cardio-cerebrovascular events.\n\nBoth Intention-to-treat Analysis (ITT) and Per-protocol set (PPS) were used for analysis.\n\nWe will use Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) event and combined cardio-cerebrovascular events during follow-up period, with hazards ratios and 95% CI calculated using Cox proportional hazards methods and the log-rank test to evaluate the treatment effect. All statistics will be 2-sided with P\\<0.05 considered significant, accounting for interim analyses.\n\nAll patients who received study drugs and with at least one safety follow-up record will be included in the safety population. The data for safety evaluation included adverse reactions observed during the trial and changes in laboratory data before and after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Stroke recurrence","Hypertension","Homocysteine","Folic acid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg+intensive antihypertensive therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive intensive antihypertensive therapy (systolic blood pressure(SBP) \\<130 mmHg); with amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg.","interventionNames":["Drug: Amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg+intensive antihypertensive therapy"]},{"label":"Amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg+standard antihypertensive therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive standard antihypertensive therapy (SBP: 130-140 mmHg); with amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg.","interventionNames":["Drug: Amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg+standard antihypertensive therapy"]},{"label":"Amlodipine+intensive antihypertensive therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive intensive antihypertensive therapy (systolic blood pressure(SBP) \\<130 mmHg); with amlodipine 5.0mg.","interventionNames":["Drug: Amlodipine+intensive antihypertensive therapy"]},{"label":"Amlodipine+standard antihypertensive therapy","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive standard antihypertensive therapy (SBP: 130-140 mmHg); with amlodipine 5.0mg.","interventionNames":["Drug: Amlodipine+standard antihypertensive therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Amlodipine folic acid 5.8mg+intensive antihypertensive therapy","description":"Amlodipine folic acid tablet 5.8mg, taken daily, in the morning after waking.\n\nTo achieve target blood pressure(SBP\\<130mmHg), this study will provide, if needed, concurrent antihypertensive medications.
