Patients with liver, kidney, and brain damage are prone to secondary MODS, and the prognosis is poor due to high medical costs. At present, there is no unified diagnostic criteria for acute liver injury associated with heat stroke, and the commonly used prognosis scores are rarely included in liver injury indicators, which is not good for practicality.","detailedDescription":"The project intends to collect the peripheral blood of the normal population, the 24 hours after the onset of heat stroke and the patients in the recovery period, to separate and extract plasma, PBMC, and plasma exosomal miRNA, and sequence to search for indicators related to disease deterioration and prognosis, construct and verify the early warning and prognosis evaluation system of the disease.\n\nOn this basis, the researcher explore cellular and molecular mediated pathological mechanisms of heat stroke, and then clarify the treatment target of heat stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heat Stroke","Early Waking","MODS","Proteinosis","Liver Injury","Kidney Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Plasma, PBMC, plasma exosome miRNA"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","description":"Healthy volunteers","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Peripheral blood test"]},{"label":"Patients within the acute phase of disease","description":"Patients within 24 hours after onset","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Peripheral blood test"]},{"label":"Recovery stage of disease","description":"Organ dysfunction was corrected, The patient had no obvious discomfort.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Peripheral blood test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Peripheral blood test","description":"Collect peripheral blood to separate and extract plasma, PBMC, and plasma exosomal miRNA, and sequence to find indicators related to disease deterioration and prognosis","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Patients within the acute phase of disease","Recovery stage of disease"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prognosis","description":"Rate of Surviving or Died Participants with Heat Stroke","timeFrame":"Day 30 and Day 90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Heat Stroke-associated kindey injury","description":"Concentration of Creatinine(Cr)\\>2 mg/dl or Urine output \\< 500ml/Day","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 7 and On the day of discharge after improvement"},{"measure":"Heat Stroke-associated liver injury","description":"Concentration of ALT or AST \\>80 U/L, Concentration of TBIL\\>2mg/dl（34μmol/l）","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 7 and On the day of discharge after improvement"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
