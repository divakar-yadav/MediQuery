Endovascular therapy (EVT) has opened the 2.0 era of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment, but still up to 1/3 of patients have poor neurological prognosis. The results of several studies at home and abroad and by our team indicate that anesthesia method and perioperative management are one of the key factors affecting the neurological prognosis of EVT treatment in AIS patients. Based on machine learning big data analysis methods, a prognostic model for EVT treatment of AIS patients can be established to guide individualized treatment decisions. Current prediction models only include patients' baseline variables, and lack the inclusion of intraoperative (anesthesia management and interventional process) and postoperative (intensive monitoring treatment) variables, which limits the clinical application of prediction tools. We will establish a large prospective cohort database including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables, integrate heterogeneous information from multiple sources based on artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms, and build prognostic prediction models with better clinical applicability and calibration, with the aim of optimizing perioperative management of endovascular therapy, guiding individualized clinical decision-making, and improving patients' clinical prognosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke,","Anesthesia","Predictive Model","Endovascular therapy","Deep learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":949,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional independence at 90 days","description":"modified Rankin Scale of 0-2","timeFrame":"90±7days after treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥18 years;\n* NIHSS score ≥4;\n* Image-confirmed (CTA/MRA/DSA) intracranial large artery occlusion;\n* ASPECT (anterior circulation) or PC-ASPECT (posterior circulation) score ≥3;\n* Endovascular treatment including arterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombolysis, and angioplasty (onset to puncture time is recommended to be less than 8 hours for anterior circulation and less than 12 hours for posterior circulation;
