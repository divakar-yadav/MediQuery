Patient-perceived fatigue will be recorded by the Borg scale every minute during the 6-minute test. The level of activity during the rehabilitation day is also part of the data collected (number of hours of physical and non-physical activity). At the end of the second 6-minute test, the patient's participation in the study ends.\n\nIn addition to the inertial measurement, two scores will be collected to assess the correlation between fatigability and the level of anxiety/depression and stroke severity :\n\n* National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)\n* Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegic Gait","Fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relationships between fatigue measured by the Borg scale during 6-minute test and cadence (number of steps per minute)","description":"The 6-min walk test (TM6) measures the greatest distance covered in 6 min of walking around two studs separated by 30 meters.\n\nThe Borg Scale is a quantitative measure of perceived exertion during exercise.
