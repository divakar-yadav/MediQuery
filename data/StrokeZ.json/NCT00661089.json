Following an initial screening visit involving a history and physical examination, subjects will be entered in to the study if they have significant spasticity of shoulder internal rotation/adduction associated with pain rated at least a 4 on the VAS for pain. Subjects will also be given a cognitive screening in which they will be asked to rate pain in hypothetical situations.\n\nShoulder pain is a frequent complication following hemiplegic stroke, and may result in further disability. Spasticity is also a complication following stroke . Botulinum toxin is used in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity and may also have pain modulating effects. Participants in this study will be asked to make total of 6 visits over a period of approximately 13 weeks. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 100 to 200 units of botulinum toxin type injected into the pectoralis major at the second visit. If there is significant spasticity for shoulder extension, subjects will also receive injections into the teres major. Subjects will be followed up with assessments of pain, functioning, active and passive range of motion and depression following the initial injection. At the 12 weeks post injection visit, the blinding will be broken and subjects initially injected with placebo will be injected with the active drug. This will be done to give all subjects an opportunity to receive the active drug, as well as to assess the effects of any differences with delayed treatment. All subjects will return 4 weeks later to repeat the same assessments above. Subjects will be called at one year post study enrollment for repeat pain ratings and for information regarding subsequent treatments.\n\n."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Shoulder Pain and Spasticity"],"keywords":["stroke","shoulder pain","spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intramuscular OnabotulinumtoxinA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Injection of Botulinum Toxin type A - onabotulinumtoxinA into specified shoulder muscles at second visit","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum Toxin Type A - OnabotulinumtoxinA"]},{"label":"Intramuscular Placebo (Saline)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Injection of saline into specified shoulder muscles at Visit 2.
