Stroke may compound these problems because of physical and mental incapacity, problems with perception and communication, and swallowing disorders. The full extent of undernutrition and its independent contribution to stroke outcome is not presently known. It is also not known whether it can be corrected, and whether doing so would improve the outcome. The aim of this study is therefore to describe the efficacy of Intensive Nutritional Supplement in Patient with Stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Malnutrition"],"keywords":["stroke","malnutrition","high protein"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"high protein supplement","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"high protein supplement given","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: high protein supplement"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"no intervention"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"high protein supplement","description":"Dietary Supplement: high protein supplement","armGroupLabels":["high protein supplement"],"otherNames":["Intensive Nutritional Supplement group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index (MBI) Score at 6 Months","description":"Scale range: 0-100 (higher values represent a better outcome)","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Chemical Laboratory Findings","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Body Mass Index","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Triceps Skin Fold Thickness","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Subjective Global Assessment","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1 st onset stroke patient\n* MRI confirms his/her stroke\n* more than 2.5% weight los within 2 weeks\n* initial serum albumin \\< 35 g/l\n* BMI \\< 18.5\n* more than MMSE 10\n* medically stable\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* recurrent stroke patient\n* malabsorption patient\n* terminal cancer","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nam-Jong Paik, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital","city":"Seongnam-si","state":"Korea, Gyeonggi-do","zip":"463-707","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.43861,"lon":127.13778}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"9771334","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Gariballa SE, Parker SG, Taub N, Castleden M.
