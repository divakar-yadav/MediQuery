Oral Anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk, but because these arrhythmias are frequently intermittent and asymptomatic, start of OAC therapy is often delayed until electrocardiographic documentation is obtained.\n\nTechnological advances in implanted dual-chamber cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices allow early detection and real time verification of AF/AFL with intracardiac electrograms (IEGM) automatically transmitted to the clinicians. Such remote diagnostic capability might be particularly relevant in patients with asymptomatic AF by allowing timely treatment. Compared to conventional periodic, (e.g., quarterly) office device evaluation, daily remote monitoring may prove superior for diagnosis of AF and prophylactic treatment of thromboembolism.\n\nThe start, stop and restart of OAC based on a predefined atrial rhythm-guided strategy in conjunction with a standard risk-stratification scheme could lead to better clinical outcomes compared with conventional clinical care. The study is designed to demonstrate a risk reduction of both thromboembolism proximate to episodes of documented AF/AFL and bleeding potentiated by chronic OAC in the absence of AF. Verification of this premise would impact the clinical practice, providing evidence to physicians for the use of HM to guide OAC in patients with AF/AFL. The results of this study should demonstrate the clinical value of wireless remote surveillance of the cardiac rhythm and may define the critical threshold of AF/AFL burden warranting OAC or antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients at risk of stroke"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Flutter","Stroke","Embolism, Systemic Arterial","Major Bleeding"],"keywords":["Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator","Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator","Home Monitoring","Oral Anticoagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2718,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home Monitoring Guided OAC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home Monitoring is fully enabled and continuous remote surveillance data is available to investigators.

The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores which correspond to the following sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Responses are recoded per a scoring key with each question having a value from 0 to 100. Scores from items in the same scale are averaged together per the scoring key to create the section and subsection (physical health and mental health) scores. For all reported scores, the lowest possible value is 0 (representing the highest disability) and the highest possible value is 100 (representing no disability). Therefore, a positive change from baseline to 1 year represents an improvement in disability, while a negative change represents a worsening of disability.","populationDescription":"Subjects with paired baseline and 1 year Quality of Life scores","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","unitOfMeasure":"Scores on a scale","timeFrame":"1 year","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Home Monitoring Guided OAC","description":"Home Monitoring is fully enabled and continuous remote surveillance data is available to investigators.
