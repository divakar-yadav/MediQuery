The purpose of the clinical testing is to evaluate the Smart AFO system with its target users: post-stroke AFO users and orthotists. This may include, but is not limited to, identifying any aspects of the Smart AFO system that could be improved through clinical testing and evaluating the gait of post-stroke AFO users walking with an AFO adjusted using the Smart AFO system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ankle-foot orthosis","orthotist"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Participant's prescribed ankle-foot orthosis","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"},{"label":"Smart AFO","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Smart AFO"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Smart AFO","description":"Diagnostic ankle-foot orthosis with AFO stiffness and range of motion settings adjusted using a mobile application","armGroupLabels":["Smart AFO"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed Up and Go (TUG) test","description":"The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is a validated timed functional test that involves standing up from a chair, walking forward for 3 meters, turning around, walking back to the chair for 3 meter, and sitting down.
