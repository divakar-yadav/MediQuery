In this randomized clinical trial, investigators proposed to examine stem cell therapy as a potential therapeutic modality. Stem cells in animal stroke models have shown reduction in infarct size and improvement in neurological function. Only one human clinical trial with intravenous autologous marrow stromal cell therapy of five patients has shown some benefit. The primary objective of this phase II study was to explore if there is favourable risk to benefit ratio for autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear stem cell therapy (BMSCs) in patients with acute ischemic stroke to justify a larger phase III trial.\n\nMethods \\& Design: The study recruited 120 men and women aged 18-70 years presenting with acute ischemic stroke (7-29 days) and a NIHSS score of ≥ 7 and BI ≤ 50. Following baseline assessment (MRI Brain, Whole Body PET scan, EEG brain, CT scan Brain and clinical examination including National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Glasgow Come Scale (GCS), participants were randomly allocated to two groups: conventional management alone (control group); or conventional management and autologous intravenous BMSCs transplantation (experimental group). Bone marrow was aspirated under local anaesthesia and the isolated BMSCs cells injected intravenously within 4 hours. The patients were monitored with hemogram \\& renal/liver function tests, CT scan brain at 36 hrs and clinical examination for a week. The patients were followed up to one year with periodic MRI brain at 3 months, 6 months, EEG \\& PET scan at 6 months and 1 year. The primary efficacy outcomes were difference between the two groups in the Modified Barthel index score and modified Rankin Scale score at six-month post-randomisation. The secondary efficacy outcomes are: NIHSS score at six-months and 1 year post-randomisation; and the modified Rankin scale score at 3 months and one year post-randomization, and functional status measured by barthel index (in binary scale \\<60 or \\>60 ) at six months and one year post-randomization. Dose response analysis were done by comparing outcomes in patients receiving various doses of bone marrow mononuclear cells.\n\nDiscussion: This phase 2 study was aimed to explore if there is a favourable risk-to-benefit ratio for stem cell therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Investigators also planned to examine whether there is justification for phase III trial of autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear stem cell therapy for acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction","Anterior Cerebral Artery Infarction"],"keywords":["Brain attack","stroke","Ischemic stroke","stem cell therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"BMSCs 30-500 million plus conventional management","interventionNames":["Other: BMSCs"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Control: conventional management"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"BMSCs","description":"30-500 million Autologous BMSCs will be given intravenously to patients with acute ischemic stroke (onset from 7 to less than 30 days).","armGroupLabels":["Bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs)"],"otherNames":["Stem cell arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional ability to perform activities of daily living on Modified Barthel Index Score","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological deficit on NIHSS score","timeFrame":"6 months and 1 year"},{"measure":"Measurement of disability on Modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months and one year"},{"measure":"Functional ability to perform activities of daily living on Modified Barthel Index (Functional status) on binary scale as independent (Barthel index > 60) or dead or dependent (Barthel Index <60)","timeFrame":"6 months and one year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients will be judged eligible if they have all of the following:\n\n1.
