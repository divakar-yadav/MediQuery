Our goal is to measure users - clinician and patient - responses to a telepresence robot, VGo, that has been modified with a humanoid torso robot, NAO, to facilitate remote communication between the patient and clinician, and to complete supervisory exercise coaching.","detailedDescription":"This is a short demonstration and survey study. Clinical staff and patients will be gathered together and our idea for the mobile service robot will discussed. A demonstration of the telepresence feature of the robots and the NAO robot greeting and helping them with simple exercises will follow (e.g., pick up and object that is handy and lift their hands over their heads). The approximately 30-minute demonstration part of the study will start with an introduction and explanation about the project and a short speech about the Rehabilitation and Robotics Lab. After the demonstration the oral consent will be read and surveys will be handed out to those study participants who agree to complete them; if necessary, the research team will assist the study participant with the survey. Surveys will then be collected, and the group will be thanked by the research team."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["upper extremity","stroke","rehabilitation","robotics","telepresence","elderly","aged","Housing for the elderly","retirement","homes for the aged"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Focus groups- Patients","description":"Subjects with or without an upper extremity disability will be asked to observe and interact with the mobile service robot.","interventionNames":["Other: Mobile Service Robot Survey for Patients"]},{"label":"Focus Groups-clinicians","description":"Clinicians with neuro-rehab experience.","interventionNames":["Other: Mobile Service Robot Survey"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mobile Service Robot Survey","description":"The goal is to build a low-cost mobile service robot that will focus on the simple, but key, repetitive, data-driven tasks that robots do well.
