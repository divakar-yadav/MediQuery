The researchers plan to recruit at least 50 qualified patients. The main purpose of this study is to establish a population pharmacokinetic model of ticagrelor , explore the correlation between its blood concentration and the events of ischemia and the adverse effects of hemorrhage, and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor in the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.","detailedDescription":"Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack are the most common types of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Patients will suffer from physiological function damage, even mental symptoms, social function and other obstacles, seriously affecting the quality of life, and bringing heavy burden to families and society.\n\nTicagelor is a new P2Y12 receptor antagonist. Compared with clopidogrel, ticagelor has stronger and more lasting platelet inhibition, and can reduce the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome .\n\nTherefore, at least 50 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease using ticagelor will be included. Before and after treatment, the laboratory examination data, NIHSS, mRS, combined medication and adverse events, and ischemic events of the patients will be collected. The population pharmacokinetics model of Ticagelor was established to evaluate its effectiveness and safety."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction","Stroke","Nervous System Diseases","Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease"],"keywords":["Vascular Diseases","Ticagrelor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Detect the drug concentration in the patient's blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between blood drug concentration and adverse events","description":"Try to find the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and adverse events","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of adverse events caused by treatment","description":"In a clinical trial, the probability of an unexpected and adverse medical event that occurs after a patient or clinical subject receives a trial drug, but it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"NIHSS","description":"NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) to assess the degree of neurological deficit in stroke patients.
