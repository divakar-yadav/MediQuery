Selfit is an advanced practice system that enables a wide range of exercises to improve patient mobility in the sub-acute stage after a stroke. The system collects, measures and analyzes the patient's activity in practice.","detailedDescription":"Objectives of the study: An evaluation of the improvement of mobility after a stroke using the Selfit system.\n\nType of study: Case Control Study. Study population: 30 patients, after stroke (men and women aged 18-85). Criteria for Inclusion: Stroke patients who are capable to walk with a little help or no help at all, with or without any assitive device, for a distance of 10 meters.\n\nIntervention: Random distribution of the study participants into two groups - Case: stroke patients (15 patients) - evaluation of patients using Selfit for 2 sessions per week, for a period of at least 30 minutes per session, during 3 weeks.\n\nControl: Stroke patients (15 patients) - continuing with current therapy with no use of the Selfit system.\n\nMeasurement tools and outcome measures:\n\nDuration of each treatment session, the duration of the actual treatment, the number of technical failures in the system during the exercise and the duration of each session will be recorded. At the end of the intervention, questionnaires describing the experience of using the system will be completed with a rating of the degree of satisfaction, convenience and simplicity of using the Selfit system. The following tests will be carried out : 10 meter walk test, Timed up and go test, Dynamic Gait Index (DGI).\n\nAnalysis of the data: For each patient's treatment, a personal activity profile will be established that includes the timing and speed of walking, the number of steps, the length and width of each step, the elevation of the leg at each step and the accuracy of the patient's performance. Statistical analysis will examine the various levels of activity throughout the intervention period for each patient and for the entire study population before and after the intervention. At the same time, the correlation between the level of activity in the treatment and the scores on the neurological tests will be examined. The data will be presented descriptively for the therapist and patient. For statistical analysis, the SPPS version 21 (IBM) will be used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Sub-acute","Mobility","Movement therapy","Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention plus therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Case group:\n\nA population that suffered a stroke and treated to improve mobility with the Selfit system (25 patients) for twice a week, at least 30 minutes per session, for a period of 3 weeks.\n\nIntervention with the Selfit system include a set of mobility task exercises.","interventionNames":["Device: Intervention plus therapy"]},{"label":"Therapy and no intervention","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Control group:\n\nA population that suffered a stroke and is being treated in the hospital without any interventions with the Selfit system."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intervention plus therapy","description":"Task oriented exercise plan to improve mobility for stroke patients","armGroupLabels":["Intervention plus therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in patient's average speed","description":"Change from baseline in mobility skills - speed (m/sec)","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in patient's average distance","description":"Change from baseline in mobility skills - distance (m)","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in patient's number of steps","description":"Change from baseline in mobility skills - number of steps","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in patient's steps height","description":"Change from baseline in mobility skills - steps height (avg. in cm)","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of Stroke .Must walk with little or no help at all, with or without an assistive device, for a distance of at least 10 meters.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- .Patients suffering from significant lower back pain and / or previous orthopedic impairment and / or cognitive impairment (grade 18 and below according to the MOCA test).\n\n.Patients who are unable to move with little or no help at all, with or without an assistive device, for a distance of 10 meters.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Israel Dudkiewicz, Prof.","affiliation":"Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center","city":"Tel-Aviv","zip":"6291789","country":"Israel","geoPoint":{"lat":32.08088,"lon":34.78057}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
