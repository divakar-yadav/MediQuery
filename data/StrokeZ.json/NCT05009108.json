The manuals include instructions for performing three trials of each subtest.\n\nAt least 30 adult patients after a stroke will be tested by use of Purdue Pegboard test administrated according to the new Czech extended version of its manual. Video of performance of each adult will be obtained. Performance of each patient, firstly in real time and secondly from video record will be evaluated twice, to obtain result for establishing all types of variability and reliability mentioned below.\n\nThe inter-rater reliability, internal variability and variability of results will be established."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Motor Activity"],"keywords":["Standardized test","Occupational therapy","Fine motor skills","Purdue Pegboard Test","Czech language","Inter-rater reliability","Internal variability","Stroke","Adults"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Czech adult patients after a stroke","description":"Czech adults patients after a stroke will be asked to fill in a informed agreement and as well to answer short questionnaire.
