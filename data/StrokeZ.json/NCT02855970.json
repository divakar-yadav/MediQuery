It will be based on the SS-QoL scale and be simple and quick to use in everyday practice. It is not simply a translation. This transcultural adaptation requires linguistic and psychometric validation, by studying its validity, its reliability and its sensitivity to change, as though it were a new instrument. The investigators will then develop a short version by reducing the items and conduct a psychometric validation.\n\nThe translation and validation of a short French version of the SS-QoL scale will generate a reliable and sensitive, easy-to-use tool suitable for use in everyday practice.\n\nThe final objective is to use this tool as a principal judgement criterion in future therapeutic trials and in patients of the Dijon Stroke Registry to bring to light prognostic factors that affect quality of life so as to provide better management of this disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patient","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: completion of a quality of life questionnaire"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"completion of a quality of life questionnaire","armGroupLabels":["patient"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"responses to a quality of life questionnaire","timeFrame":"Change compared with baseline score at Day 15, Day 60"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients aged 18 years and older.\n* Patients following a first stroke (ischemic or non-traumatic cerebral parenchyma haemorrhage) followed at a consultation at Dijon CHU and included in the Dijon Stroke Registry cohort.\n* Patients who have provided oral informed consent.\n* Patients with national health insurance cover\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of symptomatic stroke.\n* Meningeal haemorrhage.\n* Severe visual or hearing handicap making it difficult to complete the questionnaire.\n* Global severe aphasia and mutism making communication with the patient impossible-.\n* Unable to read or speak French.\n* Dementia prior to the stroke.\n* Psychiatric disorders and dependence on alcohol/drugs.\n* Bedridden before the stroke.\n* Other comorbidities considered severe by the clinician and not related to the stroke that could have significantly impaired quality of life before the stroke.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire","city":"Dijon","zip":"21079","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","asFound":"Quality of Life","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
