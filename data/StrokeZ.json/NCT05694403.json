For this reason, this survey is set up with the aim of examining four pillars: the epidemiology of stroke, communication between neurologists and GPs and satisfaction with it, secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and control/treatment of the most common sequelae after stroke. In the latter two, the emphasis is on detection and treatment, and explicitly on whose task this is (neurologist versus GP), with the aim of verifying the mutual consensus on treatment and the subsequent detection of treatment shortcomings. This study will mainly consist of interviewing general practitioners and neurologists in the periphery of Brussels. This will be done by means of partly structured questionnaires, that will be send out to the medical professionals by contact with the central umbrella organisations of neurology in the hospitals and contact with the various general practitioners' practices (directly or through the multidisciplinary meetings per region). The questionnaires will be made up in google forms, as this programme allows efficient data processing, is eas-ily understandable for every participant and as no individual patient data will be processed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurologists","interventionNames":["Other: Survey"]},{"label":"General practitioners","interventionNames":["Other: Survey"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Survey","description":"Questionnaire","armGroupLabels":["General practitioners","Neurologists"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"secondary prevention stroke: Antithrombotics","description":"Given that the purpose of our study is not to determine which antithrombotics are started, this will not be determined.
