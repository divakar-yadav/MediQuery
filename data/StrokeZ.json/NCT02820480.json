The purpose of this particular study is to gain feedback on the initial design of the Rehab in a Crate system. This will be accomplished by using qualitative ethnographic research methods (i.e. human centered design) in the form of surveys that have been carefully designed by members of the research team. The eligibility criteria of this survey research reflects the intended user base of an eventual finished product, which is survivors of stroke and cerebral palsy across the globe. And while healthcare professionals are not the user base per se, their expertise and feedback should be instrumental in the design of future iterations of the Rehab in a Crate. Ease of use, utility, design, and various features, both existing and intended, will all be surveyed items.","detailedDescription":"The investigators aim to survey stroke survivors and healthcare professionals on the design, ease of use, utility, and various features of, both existing and those yet-to-be-developed. This feedback will help to fine tune further development of this therapy gym, Rehab in a Crate, and move forward in the iteration process.\n\nNote: The device is not being used at this moment for diagnostic or evaluation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Palsy","Healthy"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","robotics","cerebral palsy","therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients/health professionals","description":"Stroke AND cerebral palsy PATIENTS: greater than 18 years of age, who are more than 3 months post stroke, as well as health professionals who have considerable experience in stroke rehabilitation will be asked to evaluate the design of the Rehab in a Crate system.
