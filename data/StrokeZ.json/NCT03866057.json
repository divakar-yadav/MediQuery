All patients will be evaluated with a standardized protocol. Functional recovery will be assessed at the discharge and after a period of 6 months.","detailedDescription":"Despite progress in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases in the acute phase, stroke remains a catastrophic event with important public health implications. Post-acute intensive rehabilitation is recommended in patients with neurological deficits, but standardized evaluation protocols are essential for evaluate the efficacy of rehabilitation and for the early identification of prognostic factors of recovery. The search for biomarkers of response to specific treatments aimed to customizing the intervention. Recent studies highlight the importance of neurophysiological markers as predictors of post-stroke epilepsy onset and prognosis. Also genetic substrate and epigenetic mechanisms have a prognostic role; the latter may be modified by the administration of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, largely prescribed according to guidelines in post-stroke depression, confirming the neurotrophic role of these drugs postulated in many studies but never demonstrated in vivo in humans. Specific physiotherapeutic interventions also seem to stimulate optimal functional recovery and brain neuroplasticity, in particular those based on the intensive repetition of tasks, such as robotics and Mirror Therapy. Given that the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity activated by these interventions are presumably different, it is hypothesizable that there are specific predictors of response for each of them.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is to identify clinical, instrumental and genetic predictors of functional recovery in hospitalized patients undergoing intensive rehabilitation after stroke, evaluated with standardized protocol. Recovery will be assessed at discharge and at follow-up after 6 months.\n\nSecondary endpoints are:\n\n* evaluate the development of post-stroke epilepsy according to the presence of early clinical seizures or electroencephalographic (EEG) anomalies identified at admission to rehabilitation;\n* demonstrate in vivo the activation of neuroplasticity by serotonin reuptake inhibitors drugs;\n* evaluate in patients with hemiplegia / hemiparesis of upper limb undergoing Mirror Therapy, robotic rehabilitation and traditional physiotherapy, the presence of specific factors predictive of functional recovery, and of response to different treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Predictors of recovery","Neurological Rehabilitation","Genetic","Epigenetic","Mirror Therapy","Neurophysiopathology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"A subgroup of those patients belonging to the IRCCS of Florence (stimate 90), after signing the informed consent, will offer a blood sample for genetic testing of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) polymorphisms at admission (Time 0) and a blood sample for the study of epigenetic modifications of BDNF at the outpatient follow-up after 6 months (Time 2)."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":270,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1 study group","description":"All patients hospitalized in 4 intensive rehabilitation Structures of Don Gnocchi Foundation during the enrollment period, suffering from acute (within 30 days) ischemic or emorragic stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in Modified Barthel Index (mBI)","description":"Functional recovery; Score from 0 to 100; higher values represent a better outcome.","timeFrame":"Admission: Time 0; Discharge, up to 3/4 weeks: Time 1; 6-months Follow up: Time 2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in Modified Rankin score","description":"Functional recovery; Score from 0 to 6; higher values represent a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"Admission: Time 0; Discharge,up to 3/4 weeks: Time 1; 6-months Follow up: Time 2"},{"measure":"change in Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA)","description":"Sensomotor recovery; Total score from 0 to 64, Upper-limb subscale 0-36; lower-limb subscale 0-28.
