Each patient received an information for agreement to participate to the study (agreement for stastical analysis of their health data during one year follow up).\n\nIn March 2015, half of those patients will be chosen (stratification), using a matched stratification process, and will be followed up over one year. Every three months, data regarding the occurrence of therapeutics changes, episodes of excessive bleeding, and thromboembolic events will be collected by general practitioners.\n\nThe data will be analysed by: - describing the characteristics of patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment; - describing the changes of medications over the year ; - comparing the occurrence of episodes of excessive bleeding ; - comparing the occurrence of thromboembolic events in patients using VKA versus patients using NOAC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Complications","Hemorrhagic Disorders","Embolism and Thrombosis"],"keywords":["Anticoagulants","Antithrombins","Atrial Fibrillation","Intracranial haemorrhage","Gastrointestinal haemorrhage","Myocardial infarction","Stroke","Venous thrombosis","Primary care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4162,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient receiving NOAC","description":"Follow up of patients receiving new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) medication","interventionNames":["Other: Follow up"]},{"label":"Patient receiving VKA","description":"Follow up of patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) medication","interventionNames":["Other: Follow up"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Follow up","description":"each three months during one year of follow up, general practioners will entered health data in database (hemorrhagic events, changes of medication, biological data...)","armGroupLabels":["Patient receiving NOAC","Patient receiving VKA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical characteristics","description":"The profile of patients receiving VKA or NOAC will be described by the following variables:\n\n* Molecule, duration, dosage\n* Indication: Atrial fibrillaton valvular or not / DVT / PE / Other, Prevention / Treatment\n* Age, sex, weight, height\n* Medication adherence ( as perceived by the GP )\n* Renal function\n* CHA2DS2-VASc Score\n* HAS-BLED Score\n* RIETE score\n* unstable INR\n* Comorbidities: anemia, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, hypertension, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular desease, myocardial infarction (MI).\n* Concomitant treatments: NSAIDs, antiplatelets, other treatments with potentials interactions","timeFrame":"at baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bleeding events","description":"Compare annual impact of bleeding events between patients receiving NOAC and VKA.
