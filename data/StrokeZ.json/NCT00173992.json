Falls are one of the primary complications after stroke. The incidence of falls ranges from 25% to 75% among stroke patients residing in different settings, with greater incidence of falls occurring after discharge home. Postural instability has been suggested as one of the main causes leading to falls in this population. The recovery of the ability to maintain balance during activities of daily living, therefore, is essential for functional independence and safety of these patients. In the following paragraphs, the knowledge gaps taht we are proposing to bridge in this study and the revelant literature that leads us to identify these gaps are discussed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Balance","Proactive control","Reactive control","Recovery","Training","Fall"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"ECT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Balance and Exercise"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To investigate the balance recovery(proactive postural adujustments and reactive postural reaction) post-onset of each stroke subject"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To investigate the incidence of falls before and after training"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nHealthy subjects\n\n* Age ang Sex are correspond with the stroke subjects(between 45 and 75 years old)\n* having the habit of regular exercise (at least twice a week, and at least 20 minutes duration each time)\n* being willing to accept one-year follow-up examination\n* being willing to sign an informed consent approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital\n\nStroke subjects\n\n* between 45 and 75 years old\n* cerebral infarction stroke confirmed by ICD-10-CM and brain imaging diagnosis(including I63.0, I63.1, I63.2, I63.3, I63.4, I63.5, I63.6, I63.8, and I63.9)\n* first stroke and received acute treatment at NTUH\n* being willing to accept one-year follow-up examination\n* being willing to sign an informed consent approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nHealthy subjects\n\n* having other neurological diseases, or moderate to severe neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders, or disorders from systematic diseases those would influence the belance or motor ability Stroke subjects\n* on the 14st day after stroke onset, having unstable vital sign, unconsciousness, or obvious cognitive, perception, and language impairment, and couldn't communicate with the experimenters\n* having other neurological diseases, or moderate to severe neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders, or disorders from systematic diseases other than stroke","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Pei-Fang Tang, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886-2-2312-3456","phoneExt":"7557","email":"pftang@ntu.edu.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pei-Fang Tang, PhD","affiliation":"National Taiwan University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"School and Graduate Institute of Physical Therapy College of Medicine, National Taiwan University","city":"Taipei","zip":"100","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Pei-Fang Tang, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886-2-23123456","phoneExt":"7557","email":"pftang@ntu.edu.tw"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
