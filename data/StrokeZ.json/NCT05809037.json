In addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation will be applied to the participants through the left ear with the Vagustim™-Ear tens electrode. As a vagus stimulation protocol, 10 sessions, 30 minutes, noninvasive auricular stimulation will be applied, stimulation frequency is 10 Hz, the pulse width is 300 µs, biphasic. In the study, sham vagus nerve stimulation (0 mA) will be applied to the participants in the control group. The study will be completed when the evaluation of the participants is made in the 1st and 3rd months after the last intervention. The upper extremity functions of the patients participating in the study were determined by Fugl-Meyer upper extremity test and box and block test, upper and lower extremity spasticities by modified Ashworth scale, and sleep quality by Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Quality of life will be evaluated with the stroke-specific quality of life scale, balance functions with the Berg balance test, dependency levels in daily activities with the Barthel index, and sympathetic dysfunctions with COMPASS-31. Participants' blood pressure and pulse values will be evaluated before and after each session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Hemiplegia","Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Stimulation for right hemiparesis patients","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Active non-invasive transauricular vagus nerve stimulation over left ear in post-stroke right hemiparesis","interventionNames":["Device: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation for right hemiparesis patients","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham non-invasive transauricular vagus nerve stimulation over left ear in post-stroke right hemiparesis","interventionNames":["Device: Sham stimulation"]},{"label":"Active Stimulation for left hemiparesis patients","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Active non-invasive transauricular vagus nerve stimulation over left ear in post-stroke left hemiparesis","interventionNames":["Device: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation for left hemiparesis patients","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham non-invasive transauricular vagus nerve stimulation over left ear in post-stroke left hemiparesis","interventionNames":["Device: Sham stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation","description":"In addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation will be applied to the participants through the left ear with the Vagustim™-Ear tens electrode.

It comprises 10 items regarding activities of daily living and mobility and assesses feeding, transfer from wheelchair to bed and back, self-care, bathing, walking, climbing stairs, dressing, and bladder and bowel continence. Scoring is based on whether the patient requires help or not in performing any of the above mentioned activities. Proposed guidelines for interpreting Barthel scores are that scores of 0-20 indicate \"total\" dependency, 21-60 indicate \"severe\" dependency, 61-90 indicate \"moderate\" dependency, and 91-99 indicates \"slight\" dependency.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline Barthel Index at 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is used to assess spasticity.
