Patients of the 1st and 2nd main groups are planned to undergo a rehabilitation course with multimodal correction, depending on the severity of functional and neuropsychological disturbances with the use of FBF-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training with double and triple tasks in a virtual environment, functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), training of subject-manipulative activity for the restoration of fine hand movements on the glove simulator \"SensoRehab\"; when severe and moderate paresis of the upper limb, the neurointerface \"Exokist-3\" with EEG registration will be used.\n\nThe mode of application of multimodal correction technology: 15 procedures, 2-3 times a week, the duration of the course is 5-8 weeks.
