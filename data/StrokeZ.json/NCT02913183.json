Recent studies showed that old age is one of the most important factors in influencing the outcome of patients with acute stroke, and the young plasma can reverse age-related brain impairments in mice. Therefore, this pilot study aims to investigate whether young plasma is effective in alleviating brain injury and neurologic deficits induced by acute stroke in patients.","detailedDescription":"This study will enroll 78 stroke patients who have been diagnosed with stroke and meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nAfter successfully meeting initial screening criteria, investigators will contact the family, explain the study, and send a consent form for their review.\n\nAfter that, patients will be given 2 unit/day young health plasma (young plasma exchange) over a course of 3 consecutive days, then investigators will make a neurofunctional assessment before and 7 days, 30 days and 90 days after young health plasma treatment. And Magnetic Resonance of the brain before, 7 days, 14 days and 90 days after young health plasma treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["acute stroke","young health plasma","efficacy","safety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":78,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"young Fresh Frozen Plasma","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
