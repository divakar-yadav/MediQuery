This study would be beneficial in a way that it will give a valuable input and will contribute for the knowledge of interventions for stroke with an emphasis on upper extremity function among health care practitioners for their goal of promoting health, prevention of diseases and improving quality of life.","detailedDescription":"Exergaming can contribute to improvement of the function of UE motor and AROM in chronic stroke patients, additional studies with a large number of subjects with long follow-up periods are required to determine their effectiveness neurorehabilitation stimulation . The exergaming protocol presented in this study represents success a tool for UE functional aspects in patients with chronic stroke. It has shown improvement in gripping strength, handicrafts and UE's operational recovery. Movement control and the position of scapula determine an optimal upper limb function. Paresis leading to scapular disorientation ultimately exaggerates motor impairment in upper extremities. Recent literature has emphasized on the need to design an upper extremity protocol including scapular stabilization exercises in order to increase muscular strength and decrease scapular dyskinesis .The results of a study showed that scapular stability exercises had an impact on hand function and the ability to move hemiplegic patients after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Exergaming Training","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exergaming training combined with Scapular stabilization exercises will be performed for 6 weeks for 3 times per week.","interventionNames":["Other: scapular stabilization exercises with exergaming training"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Exergaming training will be performed for 6 weeks for 3 times per week.","interventionNames":["Other: exergaming training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"scapular stabilization exercises with exergaming training","description":"Group A will receive scapular stabilization exercises with exergaming training","armGroupLabels":["Group A"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"exergaming training","description":"Group B will receive only exergaming training","armGroupLabels":["Group B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment tool of Upper Extremity Function","description":"To assess motor functioning, balance , sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia.\n\nChange from baseline and 2 months","timeFrame":"2 months"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"It quantifies upper extremity (UE) motor ability through timed and functional tasks.
