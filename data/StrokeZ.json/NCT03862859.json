Specifically, the study will assess the overall safety, tolerability, and efficacy of initiating treatment with Warfarin in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis and atrial fibrillation.","detailedDescription":"Data pertaining to the tolerability, safety, and benefit of initiating anticoagulation for stroke risk reduction in patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation remains conflicting and insufficient. Patients on dialysis continue to be routinely excluded from randomized controlled trials, and evidence from observational studies is plausibly biased. The main objective of the following parallel-group open randomized clinical trial presents a nationwide study aimed at investigating the benefit, tolerability, and safety of initiating warfarin versus no treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation on dialysis. The anticipated results from this project will provide conclusive evidence as to the appropriateness of initiating oral anticoagulation for stroke risk reduction in dialysis populations with atrial fibrillation with direct effects on clinical management and international guidelines pertaining to these patients.\n\nThe study is planned as a multicentre, randomized, open label, parallel group trial with planned inclusion of a total of 718 patients (359 patients per arm). Dialysis-treated patients with end-stage renal disease with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation will be enrolled and randomized to either treatment with warfarin or no treatment. Randomization with be attained using a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated randomization schedule stratified by gender, age by decade, and center using permuted blocks of random sizes. Study participants will be allocated to treatment in accordance with the randomization for the full duration of the trial i.e. at a minimum one year following randomization, and followed with regular monitoring for the the primary efficacy outcome of ischemic stroke or death due to ischemic or unspecified stroke and the primary safety outcome of major bleeding defined in accordance with the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter","Stroke","Major Bleed","End-stage Renal
