In other words, how well can the Oxford Visual Perception Screening tool (OxVPS) identify stroke patients with visual perception problems?\n\nParticipants will completed the OxVPS and the current gold standards visual perception screening tool.","detailedDescription":"This is a non-experimental cross-sectional study. It aims to compare the new screening test OxVPS to the gold standard tests for visual perception difficulties.\n\nPatients will be recruited at stroke rehabilitation units at hospitals in the North East of England and in Oxfordshire.\n\nFollowing consent:\n\n* Participants will complete the paper version of the Oxford Visual Perception Screen OxVPS (\\~15 min).\n* Participants will complete screening for visual perception problems with a validated screening tool (\\~30-120 min).\n* Participants will complete screening for cognition alterations and sensory vision with validated screening tools. (\\~30 min)\n* Stroke details (time since stroke, severity) and demographic data (age, socio-economic status) will be collected to evaluated representativeness of the sample."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Visual Perception"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke survivors","description":"Individuals who have survived a stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: OxVPS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"OxVPS","description":"Comparing a new screening tool, the Oxford visual perception screening, to the gold standard, Rivermead Perceptual Battery Assessment.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke survivors"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Validity of OxVPS","description":"Convergent and discriminate validity will be assessed. Convergent validity expressed as a correlation between total score on OxVPS and RPAB.

Subsequently, we will plot the difference in scores as a function on the average score to evaluate a bias between the raters (mean difference) that might vary based on severity of a patient's visual perceptual problems. We will report the mean difference, standard deviation, and limits of agreement within where 95% of differences between raters fall. A t-test will indicate if the mean difference is significantly different from 0.
