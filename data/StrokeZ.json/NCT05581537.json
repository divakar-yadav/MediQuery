The most common manifestations of stroke are deficits in motor control that involve abnormal synergistic organization of movements, muscle weakness, sensory deficits, and loss of range of motion. Poor posture, which is one of its main symptoms, affects falls or injured falls.\n\nFear of falling is a psychological condition associated with balance disorders and fall risks after a stroke.","detailedDescription":"Fear of falling can result in avoidance behavior, leading to inactivity and social isolation, and further exacerbate disability in stroke populations Systematic desensitization , one of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), is a psychotherapeutic intervention designed to modify unrealistic beliefs that can contribute to negative emotions and behavior. Fear of falling could result from accurate perceptions of impaired balance ability and unrealistic beliefs about one's risk of falling.\n\nSystematic desensitization may alter these self-defeating beliefs and thus reduce fear-avoidance behavior and the associated adverse consequences, such as limited social participation and is effective in reducing the fear of falling among older individuals Goal-directed training is an activity-based approach to therapy. Meaningful, client-selected goals are used to provide opportunities for problem solving and to indirectly drive the movements required to successfully meet the task demands. This is in contrast to interventions that focus on changing body functions. The approach is based on the dynamic systems motor control theory and occupation-based therapy models, which suggest that movement patterns emerge from the interaction between the person's abilities, environment and the goal. Four components provide the basis for goal-directed training: (1) selection of a meaningful goal; (2) analysis of baseline performance; (3) intervention/ practice regime; and (4) evaluation of outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group (GA)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"receive systematic desensitization in addition to goal directed paradigm for eight weeks, Three sessions per week (1hour and half)","interventionNames":["Other: Systematic Desensitization"]},{"label":"Control group (GB)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"receive goal directed paradigm for eight weeks, Three sessions per week (45 minutes)","interventionNames":["Other: Systematic Desensitization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Systematic Desensitization","description":"Systematic desensitization: 2 techniques\n\n1.
