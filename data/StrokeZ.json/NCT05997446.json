The study will enroll approximately 1000 subjects at up to 50 US clinical sites. Subjects will be followed through 24 months in accordance with each site's standard care practices.","detailedDescription":"The ADVANCE LAA study is intended to characterize real-world outcomes of patients receiving the commercially available Amulet device in the United States. The Amulet device is intended to reduce the risk of thrombus embolization from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and who are at increased risk for stroke and systemic embolism based on CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores, are suitable for short-term anticoagulation therapy, and have appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to oral anticoagulation, taking into consideration the safety and effectiveness of the device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial
