This study will assess how well the device removes clot from the brain and how well patients recover from their stroke. This study plans to enroll 100 study patients at up to 10 hospitals in Europe. Study patients are followed for 3 months after the procedure.","detailedDescription":"The study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study that will enroll a maximum of 90 subjects, plus up to 50 roll-in subjects. A maximum of 10 sites in Europe will be involved in this study. The primary performance endpoint is successful revascularization defined as TICI 2b-3 flow in the target vessel post-treatment of up to three passes with the DAISe System. The primary safety endpoint is symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage at 24 hours post-procedure as detected by CT/MRI with an NIHSS change of \\>/=4. Subject will be followed through hospital discharge with a visit at Day 1 post procedure, Day 7 or prior to discharge/transfer, 30 days and 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke,

Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 to 85 years.\n* Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with study enrollment time \\< 8 hours from onset of symptoms.\n* Disabling stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS \\> 6.\n* Pre-stroke (24 hours prior to stroke onset) independent functional status in activities of daily living with modified Rankin Score 0-1.\n* If thrombolytic therapy (tPA) is administered, it must be administered per the prescribing information.\n* Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs), or M2-MCA.\n* The following baseline imaging criteria should be met: MRI criterion: ASPECTS Score \\> 4 OR CT criterion: ASPECTS \\> 6\n* Signed informed consent from patient or legally authorized representative.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* CT or MRI evidence of recent/ fresh hemorrhage on presentation.\n* Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic.\n* Rapidly improving neurological deficits based on the investigator's clinical judgement.\n* Pregnancy\n* Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.\n* No femoral pulses or very difficult endovascular access that will result in an inability to deliver endovascular therapy.\n* Evidence of dissection in the carotid or middle cerebral arteries.\n* Severe unilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenosis requiring treatment at the time of the procedure as determined during diagnostic angiography.\n* Renal failure (serum creatinine level â‰¥ 4 mg/dL or on dialysis).\n* Severe, sustained hypertension (SBP \\>185 mmHg or DBP \\>110 mmHg).\n* Cerebral vasculitis.\n* Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial endocarditis.\n* Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).\n* Seizure due to stroke.\n* Platelet count \\< 50,000/mm3.\n* A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.\n* Patient is unable or unwilling complete follow up visits.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
