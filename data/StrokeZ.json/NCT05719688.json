Level 2: Mildly disabled, unable to perform all work and activities, but able to handle personal matters without assistance from others. Level 3: moderately disabled, requiring assistance, to walking without assistance. Level 4: Severely disabled, unable to walk without assistance, unable to care for their own needs.
