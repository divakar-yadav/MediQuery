Patients who are eligible for the trial will be randomized to receive either the Amulet device or the WATCHMAN device and will be followed for 5 years after device implant.","detailedDescription":"The Amulet IDE trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-center active control worldwide trial, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the AMPLATZER™ Amulet™ Left Atrial Appendage Occluder. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the Amulet left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion device (treatment) or a Boston Scientific WATCHMAN® LAA closure device (Control). The trial will be conducted at up to 150 sites worldwide.
