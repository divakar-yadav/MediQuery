Additionally, we aim to investigate the acceptance of this intervention from patients and therapists. A total of 10 patients will be recruited in this study, all the patients will receive 1 hour of standard therapy together with 45 min of robot therapy every day. The robot therapy will last 45 minutes, for 15 consecutive days within a maximum period of four weeks. Additional 15 minutes are required for placing surface electrodes on the shoulder and patient preparation. The study will include passive and active shoulder training of four movements: Horizontal abduction/adduction, abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation and flexion/extension. The passive part lasts 10 minutes and the active part 35 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Upper limb","Robotics","Electromyography","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The RehaARM-Robot","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receive 45 min of robot-assisted therapy for the shoulder and 1 hour of daily standard rehabilitation therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: The RehaARM-Robot","Behavioral: Standard rehabilitation therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"The RehaARM-Robot","description":"Robot therapy by using a 3-Degrees-Of-Freedom (3DOFs) robot to train the shoulder.","armGroupLabels":["The RehaARM-Robot"],"otherNames":["Robot-assisted therapy for the shoulder"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Standard rehabilitation therapy","description":"Standard therapy of stroke rehabilitation including speech, physical, occupational therapies and group activities.","armGroupLabels":["The RehaARM-Robot"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale - Upper Extremity (FMA-UE)","description":"Motor function of the upper limb is measured by means of the Upper Extremity Motor Assessment of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale.","timeFrame":"3 weeks (15 sessions)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Independence Measure (FIM)","description":"FIM is an 18-item scale that assesses patient's disability and medical rehabilitation functional outcome (A total of 126 points).","timeFrame":"3 weeks (15 sessions)"},{"measure":"Reaching Performance Scale (RPS)","description":"It assesses the ability of subjects to reach an object (a cone).
