Two techniques will be used: cardiac ultrasound-derived stroke volume measurements and body impedance measurements. 20 healthy men (n=10) and women (n=10) aged 18-45 years will be investigated at rest and during exercise. All study procedures are non-invasive."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy young men and women","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single group consisting of 10 men and 10 women","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Acute exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Acute exercise","description":"Acute exercise with different exercise intensities","armGroupLabels":["Healthy young men and women"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiac stroke volume","timeFrame":"1 min"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes","timeFrame":"1 min"},{"measure":"Ejection fraction","timeFrame":"1 min"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18-45\n* BMI 18-30\n* Resting Blood pressure \\< 140/90 mmHg\n* Participation in regular exercise\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute illness\n* Pregnancy\n* Pace maker\n* Artificial joint\n* History of a cardiac event\n* Insulin or medically treated diabetes\n* Any chronic disease or condition that could create a hazard to the subject safety, endanger the study procedures or interfere with the interpretation of study results\n* Abundant use of alcohol\n* Use of narcotics\n* Smoking of tobacco or consuming snuff tobacco\n* Diagnosed depressive or bipolar disorder\n* Abnormalities in resting ECG (revised by the study physician)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ilkka HA Heinonen, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"408393962","phoneExt":"+358","email":"ilkka.heinonen@utu.fi"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Turku PET Centre","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Turku","zip":"20521","country":"Finland","contacts":[{"name":"Ilkka H Heinonen, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+35823138145","email":"ilkka.heinonen@utu.fi"},{"name":"Ilkka Heinonen, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Petri Kallio","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":60.45148,"lon":22.26869}},{"facility":"University of Turku","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Turku","country":"Finland","contacts":[{"name":"Ilkka Heinonen, PhD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":60.45148,"lon":22.26869}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
