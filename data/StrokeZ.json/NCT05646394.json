The registry collects data on patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and an arterial event within the past 12 months, on treatment with either A) a VKA with therapeutic range, INR 2.0-3.0 plus low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily), B) a VKA alone with therapeutic range, INR 2.0-3.0, C) a VKA with therapeutic range, INR 3.0-4.0, or D) with a dual antiplatelet regimen. The follow-up is 2 years.","detailedDescription":"The optimal antithrombotic management of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and arterial thrombotic events is unclear. The guidelines provide several options, mostly with vitamin K antagonist with/without an antiplatelet agent. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was in a meta-analysis potentially effective, but included studies were few and small.\n\nThe primary aim is to compare a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), i.e. warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon etc, with international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0 plus low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg) with DAPT - typically low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel (75 mg daily) but other combinations will be acceptable. The registry will also include patients treated with VKA alone at standard- or high-intensity, since this is recommended and will serve as reference groups in comparison with VKA + low-dose aspirin and versus DAPT. The outcomes are (efficacy) arterial or venous thromboembolism, vascular death or (safety) major bleeding.\n\nA secondary objective is to analyze how the cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, diabetes, and heart failure), venous thrombotic risk factors (previous venous thromboembolism, cancer, immobility, chronic inflammatory disease) and anti-phospholipid profile contribute to recurrent arterial thrombosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Antiphospholipid Syndrome","Arterial Thrombosis"],"keywords":["anticoagulation","vitamin K antagonist","antiaggregant","stroke","myocardial infarction","hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dual antiplatelet therapy","description":"Aspirin plus any of clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel","otherNames":["Aspirin","Plavix","Brilinta","Effient"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Combined antithrombotic therapy","description":"Combination of a vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, phenindione etc, with low-dose aspirin.","otherNames":["Vitamin K antagonist plus aspirin","Vitamin K antagonist plus antiaggregant","Vitamin K antagonist plus antiplatelet agent"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin K antagonist standard intensity","description":"vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, phenindione etc, with therapeutic range, international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0","otherNames":["VKA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin K antagonist high intensity","description":"vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, phenindione etc, with therapeutic range, international normalized ratio 3.0-4.0","otherNames":["VKA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with thromboembolism verified by diagnostic imaging, electrocardiogram or troponin rise","description":"Composite of arterial thrombosis (stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial thrombosis or embolism), venous thromboembolism (thrombosis in any deep vein or pulmonary embolism), and vascular death.","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Number of Participants with major hemorrhage fulfilling at least one of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria","description":"Major hemorrhage according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with arterial thrombosis verified by diagnostic imaging","description":"stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial thrombosis or embolism","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Number of Participants with venous thromboembolism verified by diagnostic imaging","description":"thrombosis in any deep vein or pulmonary embolism","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Number of Participants with vascular death verified by diagnostic imaging, electrocardiogram or troponin rise","description":"Death due to arterial or venous thromboembolism","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

The information should include that vitamin K antagonist is the recommended standard, either alone or in combination and, in case dual antiplatelet regimen is chosen, an explanation to the patient for what reasons it should be used or continued. Patients that have been started on either of the eligible regimens after the most recent arterial thromboembolic event and within the past 12 months can be approached and informed about the study. If the patient meets the inclusion criteria and does not have any of the exclusion criteria, the investigator or designated representative obtains consent for collection of data.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sam Schulman, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+19055270271","phoneExt":"44810","email":"schulms@mcmaster.ca"},{"name":"Hannah Cohen, MD, FRCP","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+442034477368","phoneExt":"9456","email":"hannah.cohen@ucl.ac.uk"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Cary Clark","affiliation":"International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud Pública, Universidad de Buenos Aires","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Buenos Aires","state":"Ciudad Autónoma De Buenos Aires","zip":"C1113 AAJ","country":"Argentina","contacts":[{"name":"Patricia Casais, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(11)50324141","email":"patricia.casais@odontologia.uba.ar"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-34.61315,"lon":-58.37723}},{"facility":"Clinica Universitaria Reina Fabiola","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Córdoba","country":"Argentina","contacts":[{"name":"Soledad Molnar, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0351-4142121"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-31.4135,"lon":-64.18105}},{"facility":"McMaster University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hamilton","state":"Ontario","zip":"L9H 7M1","country":"Canada","contacts":[{"name":"Sam Schulman","role":"CONTACT","phone":"9059796437","email":"schulms@mcmaster.ca"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":43.25011,"lon":-79.84963}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Case report form - DO NOT ENTER DATA WITHOUT OBTAINING CENTER NUMBER; links to study protocol, ethics approval; informed consent form","url":"https://redcap.isth.org/surveys/?s=9RC8EEDPX3"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"The study protocol and ICF are available on the ISTH website (under SSC - RedCap.
