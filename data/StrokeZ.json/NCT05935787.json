Antioxidants may have a positive effect on the processes of reparation, remodeling and neuroplasticity, thus improving the effectiveness of post-stroke rehabilitation. The adjunctive use of drug therapy that improves neuroplasticity may promote accelerated motor learning, which underlies the effects of exercise therapy and physical therapy, speech therapy, and sessions with a psychologist or occupational therapist. CYTOFLAVIN® is a combination of succinic acid, riboflavin, nicotinamide and inosine (riboxin) which has antihypoxic and antioxidant effects. The study hypothetizes that this neurometabolic drug will facilitate learning in stroke survivors and help to acquire new cognitive or motor skills necessary for daily living. The study will be conducted in two parallel groups of stroke survivors: the experimental group will be treated with Cytoflavin along with ohysical rehabilitation, the control group will receive standard rehabilitation course."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":196,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cytoflavin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Cytoflavin (Inosine + Nicotinamide + Riboflavin + Succinic Acid)"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cytoflavin (Inosine + Nicotinamide + Riboflavin + Succinic Acid)","description":"Cytoflavin (Inosine + Nicotinamide + Riboflavin + Succinic Acid), 20 ml (two ampoules of 10 ml each) once a day intravenously in a dilution of 200 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution at a rate 3-4 ml/min, for 15 days + Cytoflavin ((Inosine + Nicotinamide + Riboflavin + Succinic Acid), 2 tablets 2 times a day, for 25 days","armGroupLabels":["Cytoflavin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo, 20 ml (two ampoules of 10 ml each) once a day intravenously in a dilution of 200 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution at a rate 3-4 ml / min, for 15 days + Placebo, 2 tablets 2 times a day, for 25 days","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of performance","description":"Change at the performance subscale (range 0-10, higher=better) of Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) score after completion of therapy compared to baseline","timeFrame":"40 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
