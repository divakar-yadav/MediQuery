How many people develop stroke-shoulder pain within 3 days of stroke?\n2. How many people have stroke shoulder pain at 8-10 weeks after stroke?\n3. Does having stroke-shoulder pain within 3 days of stroke predict the likelihood of having stroke-shoulder pain at 8-10 weeks?\n4. What are the best bedside examination tests to identify stroke-shoulder pain?","detailedDescription":"Patients will be assessed very early after stroke (within 72 hours) and followed up 8-10 weeks later. Findings will enable planning of fully-powered randomised controlled trials of both, pain-prevention strategies and treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Shoulder Pain","Hemiplegia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":163,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single group baseline and follow-up","description":"Single group of adult stroke patients assessed using ShoulderQ shoulder pain questionnaire and Clinical shoulder examination at two time-points:\n\nBaseline: within 72 hours post-stroke Follow-up: at 8-10 weeks post-stroke","interventionNames":["Other: ShoulderQ which is a shoulder pain questionnaire","Other: Clinical shoulder examination"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"ShoulderQ which is a shoulder pain questionnaire","description":"Questions regarding shoulder pain at rest, during movement and at night with visual analogue scales.
