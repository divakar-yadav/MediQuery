Poor adherence to evidence based secondary prevention regimens is frequently seen. Support programs for patients may not only improve adherence to recommended therapies but also reduce the recurrence rate of stroke and heart attack. The investigators hypothesize that compared to regular care, a structured and patient centered secondary prevention program will lead to a relative risk reduction of at least 28% of recurrent vascular events.","detailedDescription":"Although effective methods of secondary prevention after stroke or TIA are available, adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is often poor. Programs for supported secondary prevention after cerebrovascular events with improved health education are promising but have not been evaluated regarding recurrent event reduction so far.\n\nA prospective randomized trial has been started to assess the effectiveness of a patient centered structured support program intending a reduction of recurrent vascular events. Usual care consists of structured information given at discharge as well as regular outpatient care by general practitioners. The support program additionally employs a stepwise intensified support program with up to eight appointments over two years in outpatient clinics. Results of risk factor measurements and assessed adherence to medical recommendations are shared with the patients. They are also offered assistance in finding appropriate physical activities or smoking cessation programs.\n\nPatients are randomized to regular care or regular care plus support program and will be followed-up until the total number of 317 primary endpoints has been reached. The composite primary endpoint consists of stroke, major coronary event and vascular death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mini-Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, TIA, secondary prevention, support program, multifactorial intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2082,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Regular care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Consisting of structured information given at hospital discharge regarding stroke etiology and recommended secondary prevention plus regular outpatient care by general practitioners or family doctors."},{"label":"Support program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In addition to regular care: Up to 8 appointments in outpatient clinics.
