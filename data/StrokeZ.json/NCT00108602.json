We will select a subset of patients with stroke in the prior 3 months who are most likely to have ventilatory instability as a cause of the upper airway obstruction as indicated by the absence of obesity, an abnormal hypocapnic apnea threshold and resolution of obstructive apnea during CO2 administration. Following baseline polysomnography, patients will be randomly assigned to acetazolamide (250 mg hs \\[at bedtime\\]) versus placebo for 7 days. Polysomnography will be repeated and then subjects will cross-over therapies for another 7 days followed by a final nocturnal polysomnography.","detailedDescription":"This study never enrolled patients.
