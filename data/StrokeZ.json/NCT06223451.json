A total of 22 stroke patients, informed about the applied treatments and potential risks, and providing written consent, will be randomly assigned to receive either active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with conventional rehabilitation (Mirror therapy and Visual scanning training) or sham (imitation) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with conventional rehabilitation.\n\nThe study will include 22 randomly selected patients with neglect, with 11 planned in the intervention group and 11 in the control group. Patients will receive active rTMS or sham rTMS for a total of 10 sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, alongside conventional rehabilitation over a period of 2 weeks. rTMS applications will be conducted once daily before the daily rehabilitation program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neglect, Hemispatial"],"keywords":["İskemic stroke","Transcranial magnetic stimulation","Unilateral neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The patients participating in the study are unaware of their group assignment, and the evaluator assessing the results is also blinded to the patients' group allocation; therefore, a double-blind study has been designed.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke patients with unilateral neglect.","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to 11 patients with unilateral neglect due to ischemic stroke under the supervision of a doctor for a total of 10 sessions over 2 weeks with conventional rehabilitation.
