Patients with acute stroke will be studied by both TTE and TEE. Patients with already defined stroke etiology and determined secondary prevention will be excluded from the trial. Treatment relevant diagnostic findings will be identified by a central endpoint adjudication committee. In order to demonstrate a hypothesized 2% absolute increase in the number of treatment relevant diagnostic findings by TEE as compared to TTE, 880 stroke patients will be enrolled in six German stroke centers. CONTEST will allow answering the question whether and for which group of stroke patients TEE is indicated in addition to TTE. By this, the study will provide evidence to guide justified recommendations for echocardiography in acute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke, echocardiography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":494,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Diagnostic Findings That Lead to a Change in Acute Treatment or Treatment for Secondary Prevention","description":"Treatment relevant diagnostic findings identified by a central endpoint adjudication committee comprising both cardiologists and neurologists.","timeFrame":"Inpatient treatment on a stroke unit usually <7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Patients With Change of Assessment of Stroke Etiology After TEE","description":"Number of patients with change in the assessment of stroke etiology (cardioembolism, large artery atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, other determined etiology, unknown etiology) after performing TEE","timeFrame":"Inpatient treatment on a stroke unit usually <7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute ischemic stroke or transitory ischemic attack (TIA)\n* age ≥18 years\n* informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with already defined stroke etiology and determined secondary prevention treatment strategy prior to echocardiography (e.g. atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, cervical artery dissection)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with acute stroke in whom echocardiography is indicated will be studied by TTE and TEE.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Götz Thomalla, MD","affiliation":"Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf","city":"Hamburg","zip":"20246","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.57532,"lon":10.01534}},{"facility":"Albertinen-Krankenhaus","city":"Hamburg","zip":"22457","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.57532,"lon":10.01534}},{"facility":"Regio Klinikum Pinneberg","city":"Pinneberg","zip":"25421","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.66732,"lon":9.78936}},{"facility":"Kreiskliniken Reutlingen","city":"Reutlingen","zip":"72764","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":48.49144,"lon":9.20427}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34496617","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Thomalla G, Upneja M, Camen S, Jensen M, Schroder J, Barow E, Boskamp S, Ostermeier B, Kissling S, Leinisch E, Tiburtius C, Clausen H, Cheng B, Blankenberg S, Nedelmann M, Steinbrecher A, Andres F, Rosenkranz M, Sinning C, Schnabel RB, Gerloff C.
