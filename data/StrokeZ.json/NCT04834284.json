Pharmacological treatment is less effective if the thrombus occluding the artery is big enough and mechanical thrombectomy is required to gain recanalization. Mechanical thrombectomy can be done only in comprehensive stroke centres. There are 5 comprehensive stroke centres in Finland which causes regional inequality when it comes to reaching mechanical thrombectomy in a reasonable time limit.\n\nThe aims of the study is to measure the effect of dispatching a helicopter emergency medical services unit on the treatment delays of a stroke patient with large vessel occlusion. The HEMS unit is dispatched to both: getting patient directly to the comprehensive stroke centre as well as to interfacility tranfers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS)","description":"Patients transported to the comprehensive stroke centre at least in some part by a HEMS unit"},{"label":"Ground Emergency Medical Services (GEMS)","description":"Patients transported to the comprehensive stroke centre solely by an ambulance"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The difference of transport times from the onset of ambulance transport to Tampere university hospital until the recording of CT Scout image","description":"minutes","timeFrame":"from onset of symptoms up to 24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The difference of onset to revascularisation time between the groups from the onset of symptoms (last known well) until save time of \"post revascularization\" image","description":"minutes","timeFrame":"from onset of symptoms up to 24 hours"},{"measure":"The time difference from the onset of symptoms (last known well) until the save time of \"post revascularization\" image","description":"minutes","timeFrame":"from onset of symptoms up to 24 hours"},{"measure":"90 days modified Rankin scale outcome","description":"mRS 0-6","timeFrame":"telephone interview 90 days after mechanical thrombectomy"},{"measure":"Availability of the ambulance to the next emergency medical services mission in its own region.
