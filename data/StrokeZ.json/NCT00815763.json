Stroke patients were randomized equally to receive a 14-day infusion of placebo or ginsenoside-Rd 20mg. Primary end points were NIHSS scores at 15 days. Secondary end points were NIHSS scores and the Barthel index at 8 days, the Barthel index and the modified Rankin scale at 15 days and 90 days. The safety end points included serious and nonserious adverse events, laboratory values and vital signs. Analysis was by intention to treat."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["randomized trial","ischemic stroke","Ginsenoside-Rd"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":390,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ginsenoside-Rd 20mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"infusion of ginsenoside-Rd 20mg once a day and continued for 14 days","interventionNames":["Drug: ginsenoside-Rd"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"infusion placebo (group B)once a day and continued for 14 days","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ginsenoside-Rd","description":"infusion ginsenoside-Rd 20 mg once a day and continued for 14 day","armGroupLabels":["ginsenoside-Rd 20mg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"infusion placebo once a day and continued for 14 day","armGroupLabels":["placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS scores","timeFrame":"8 days"},{"measure":"NIHSS scores","timeFrame":"15 days"},{"measure":"the Barthel index","timeFrame":"8 days"},{"measure":"the Barthel index","timeFrame":"15 days"},{"measure":"the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"15 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* between 18 to 75 years\n* the first episode\n* from onset to admission within 72 hours\n* NIHSS scores:5\\~22\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* had other intracranial pathologies (e.g., tumor, infection)\n* had a neurologic or psychiatric disease\n* had a coexisting condition that limited their life expectancy\n* had significant drug or alcohol misuse\n* had high-grade carotid artery stenosis for which surgery was planned\n* were pregnant or nursing\n* participated in a clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within the past 3 months\n* were unlikely to be available for follow-up","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gang Zhao, MD","affiliation":"the Department of Neurology , Xijing Hospital","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Xuedong Liu, MD","affiliation":"the Department of Neurology, Xijing Hospital","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"the Department of Neurology , Xijing Hospital","city":"Xi'an","state":"Shaanxi","zip":"710032","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":34.25833,"lon":108.92861}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
