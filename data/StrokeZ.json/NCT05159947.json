double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel controlled clinical trial in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke. Objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SPT-07A injection compared with placebo in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"The target population of this study is patients with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours. All potential participants must provide informed consent, and those who provide informed consent will enter the screening (- 48 \\~ 0h), and the screening qualification will be evaluated according to the inclusion criteria. The eligible subjects will enter the treatment period (day 1-7) and will be randomly assigned to the experimental group (SPT-07A injection group) or the control group (placebo group).\n\nDuring the treatment period, all subjects will receive SPT-07A injection or placebo by intravenous drip, twice a day for 7 consecutive days. During the treatment, all subjects need to receive basic treatment: citicoline sodium injection 0.25g, intravenous drip slowly, once a day, continuous administration for 7 days. According to the Chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke (2018), the patients were given antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, lipid-lowering, anticoagulant or mannitol. All subjects were not allowed to receive interventional therapy (mechanical thrombectomy or stent implantation, etc.), thrombolysis (such as rtPA and urokinase), other cerebrovascular dilators (such as Butylphthalide, Flunarizine, Nicardipine and Nimodipine, etc.), other neuroprotective agents (such as Edaravone,etc., except citicoline) during the whole trial period. After the end of the treatment period (the 7th day), the subjects will enter the follow-up period (the 8th-90th day).\n\nDuring the follow-up period, subjects need to be followed up twice (30th day ± 3 days, 90th day ± 7 days)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1112,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Test group (SPT-07A injection group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: SPT-07A injection"]},{"label":"Control group (placebo group)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"SPT-07A injection","description":"20mg (2), dissolved in 250ml of normal saline, and injected intravenously for 90±20min, twice a day, and administered for 7 days.","armGroupLabels":["Test group (SPT-07A injection group)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"placebo","description":"2 Injection simulants, dissolved in 250ml of normal saline, and injected intravenously for 90±20min, twice a day, and administered for 7 days.","armGroupLabels":["Control group (placebo group)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Good outcome at 90 days","description":"proportion of subjects with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 1","timeFrame":"at day 90 (±7)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"proportion of subjects with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2 at day 90(±7)","description":"proportion of subjects with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2","timeFrame":"at day 90(±7)"},{"measure":"National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) at day 8(+1)","description":"proportion of subjects with a National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) 0-1 or mean improvement value from baseline","timeFrame":"at day 8(+1)"},{"measure":"Barthel Index (BI) at day 90(±7)","description":"proportion of subjects with a Barthel Index (BI) ≥95","timeFrame":"at day 90(±7)"},{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 8(+1), 30(±3) and day 90(±7)","description":"score of modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","timeFrame":"at day 8(+1), 30(±3) and day 90(±7)"},{"measure":"National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) at day 8(+1), 30(±3) and day 90(±7)","description":"score of National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS)","timeFrame":"at day 8(+1), 30(±3) and day 90(±7)"},{"measure":"Barthel Index (BI) at day 8(+1), 30(±3) and day 90(±7)","description":"score of Barthel Index (BI)","timeFrame":"at day 8(+1), 30(±3) and day 90(±7)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Males or females aged 18 to 85 years;\n2. According to the Key points for diagnosis of various major cerebrovascular diseases in China 2019 and combined with the experience of clinicians, patients with ischemic stroke were diagnosed;\n3. From \"the last time that looks normal\" to the beginning of drug treatment ≤ 48 hours. When the onset time of symptoms can not be accurately obtained after awakening stroke or due to aphasia, disturbance of consciousness and other reasons, the final time of normal performance of patients should be taken as the criterion.\n4. First onset of ischemic stroke or prestroke with mRS of 0 or 1;\n5. A National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score between 6 and 20, and a total score of upper and lower limbs ≥2 on motor deficits;\n6. Capable of understanding the purpose and risk of the study and has signed, in writing, the informed consent form (ICF). If the subject is not capable of this at the time of enrollment, a legally authorized representative (LAR) will provide written informed consent in accordance with all regulations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Serious disturbance of consciousness (NIHSS 1a ≥2 score);\n2. Based on the opinion of the Investigator, the posterior circulation symptoms like ataxia in stroke patients are caused by posterior circulation ischemia, such as brainstem or cerebellum;\n3. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) revealed intracranial hemorrhagic diseases (such as cerebral hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ventricular hemorrhage, traumatic cerebral hemorrhage, etc.);\n4. Rapidly improving or resolving symptoms, suggesting a possible transient ischemic attack (TIA) rather than a qualifying stroke;\n5.
