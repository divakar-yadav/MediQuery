A total of 20 patients will be enrolled and will undergo motor, functional and cortical excitability evaluations before and after four weekly sessions of radial shockwaves. 5,000 pulses with a frequency of 15 Hz and 3.5 to 4 bar of air pressure will be applied to the active group, resulting in an energy flux density (EFD) of approximately 0.07 mJ/mm2. The sham group will receive identical treatment, except for the fact that no energy flux will be applied."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Radial Shockwave","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Every patient will receive 5,000 continuous pulses per treatment session, at 3.5 to 4 bar air pressure (resulting in an energy flux density \\[EFD\\] of approximately 0.07 mJ/mm2) and at 15Hz frequency.
