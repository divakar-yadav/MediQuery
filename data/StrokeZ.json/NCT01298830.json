tomography (CCT) or Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT)\n* Patients who need by judgement of a clinical neurologist or neurosurgeon surgical removal of the blood clot due to its space-occupying effects\n* Age greater or equal 18 years for men\n* Age greater or equal 18 years for women if confirmed infertility (e.g. hysterectomy or surgical sterilisation at least 3 months before study start)\n* For all other women age greater or equal 50 years with last menstrual bleeding at least one year before study start\n* Minimum hematoma diameter of 2 cm as measured in baseline CCT or MRT\n* Signed, written informed consent of patient or consent/assertion from the patient's legally acceptable representative/affiliated if the patient is unable to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participation in any other clinical trial within the past 3 months or ongoing\n* Occurrence of inconsistency with initial diagnosis at baseline during surgery of the patient leading to unfulfilled inclusion criterion Hemorrhage secondary to tumour or trauma\n* Patients with a cerebellar hemorrhage or extension of a supratentorial hemorrhage into the brainstem\n* Patients with severe pre-existing physical or mental disability or severe comorbidity that interferes with the assessment of outcome\n* Allergy to contrast media (MRT)\n* Acute infection\n* Muscular, neurological, or vascular insufficiency of the respective tissue\n* Polypropylene incompatibility\n* Acute immunosuppressive medication\n* Patient after organ transplantation\n* Patient with immune depression\n* Patients with a high probability of spontaneous recovery or showing rapidly improving signs\n* Patients with extensive intracranial hemorrhages or with deep hemispheric localisation of the clots\n*
