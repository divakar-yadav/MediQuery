However, there has not yet been a report on the cortical activity changes induced by whole body vibration exercise.\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. One group will go through whole body vibration with exercise and the other will only perform exercise. The primary outcome measurement of this study was cerebral cortex activity based on changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Behavioral assessments were performed before and after the intervention session using the 10-meter walk test, timed up and go test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Whole body vibration exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio using an odd or even random numbers table.
