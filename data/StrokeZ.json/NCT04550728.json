However, for stroke survivors with sensorimotor impairment, their peripheral muscle may not sufficiently be recruited. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), has been shown its advantage to activate the peripheral muscles for people with neurological conditions. The investigators thus make a hybrid robot-FES rehabilitation system, combining the advantage of robot and FES technologies for stroke motor recovery. The investigators further would like to translate the technologies from lab to home-based training. Thus, the investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled, primarily home-based clinical trial using an ankle robot alone or combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES) to treat sensorimotor and locomotion impairments post-stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","functional electrical stimulation","robot training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FES+robot","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will have FES during ankle robot training","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Ankle robot training and functional electrical stimulation(FES) group"]},{"label":"Robot","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group will have ankle robot training only","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Ankle robot training group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Ankle robot training group","description":"Patients will be seated with the paretic foot strapped to the footplate the knee at full extension.
