In addition to artery rupture, recent data suggests that patients with ICH are also at risk for developing occlusion of arteries during the acute phase, called ischemic strokes. Data suggests these ischemic strokes can negatively impact patient outcomes. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a sequence on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that is a sensitive marker for ischemic strokes in the brain. In this proposal, our primary aim is examine prospectively the effect DWI abnormalities have on functional outcomes in patients with ICH. Our hypothesis is that the DWI abnormalities found on MRI of the brain lead to worse functional outcomes in patients with ICH","detailedDescription":"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a sensitive method to assess for secondary ischemia in patients with acute brain injury. By comparing the outcomes of patients with and without DWI abnormalities, we would able to assess the impact these lesions have on functional recovery in patients with ICH. Since no direct therapies exist for this disease, DWI abnormalities may be a novel target for intervention to improve outcomes. If traditionally assessed functional outcomes are not affected by DWI, the mechanism behind these lesions would still warrant further evaluation and potential treatment. Detection of subclinical infarcts has emerged as a potential surrogate marker for subsequent risk of stroke, vascular dementia, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the cause behind DWI lesions in acute ICH may lead to better understanding the pathophysiologic interplay between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhage;
