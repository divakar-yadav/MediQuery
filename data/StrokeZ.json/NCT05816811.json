Skeletal muscle mass and strength are fundamental contributors to mobility throughout the adult life course. Stroke-related muscle atrophy contributes to loss of strength, and declines in lower extremity function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and walking independence and post-stroke sarcopenia. Improving the quantity and function of skeletal muscle needs to be an important therapeutic target after stroke. Resistance exercise training (RET) has been shown to increase skeletal muscle mass, strength and power, reduce oxidative stress, improve cardiac function, and better regulate lipids after stroke. However, the feasibility and the effects of a power focused RET program for individuals with stroke need to be examined.","detailedDescription":"This study is a single-group, open label trial examining the feasibility and preliminary effect estimates of a 10-week power-focused exercise training program in people living with stroke. Fifteen participants with chronic stroke will participate in the exercise program 3 times per week for 10 weeks at a progressive intensity. The program will take place at a community exercise gym built for older adults and people with physical disabilities. Feasibility outcomes will be assessed throughout the trial. Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Resistance training","Power training","Feasibility study","Skeletal muscle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single-group pilot trial aimed at examining the feasibility of a 10-week power-focused resistance training intervention for people with stroke","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Power Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The program is intentionally designed with 3 progressive phases: Phase 1 Familiarization (Week 1) will allow participants to begin with a low-intensity version of the training program (body weight resisted or light weights at RPE 2-3 for 8 repetitions) to acclimate participants to the movements.
