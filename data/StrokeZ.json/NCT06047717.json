Using a novel Virtual Reality (VR) program, the researchers will gather data on steering behavior in a variety of simulated naturalistic environments. Through the combined use of computer vision, deep learning, and gaze-contingent manipulations of the visual field, this work will test the central hypothesis that changes to visually guided steering behaviors in CB are a consequence of changes to the visual sampling and processing of task-related motion information (i.e., optic flow)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Quadrantanopia","Hemianopsia, Homonymous","Hemianopia, Homonymous","Hemianopia","Hemianopsia","Occipital Lobe Infarct","Visual Field Defect, Peripheral","Vision Loss Partial","Quadrantanopsia","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Occipital stroke","Vision loss after stroke","Vision recovery","Vision restoration","Partial vision loss","Homonymous quadrantanopsia","Homonymous quadrantanopia","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality (VR) Driving Task: Cortically Blind Cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Persons who have sustained cortical blindness will perform a driving task in VR, in which they must steer through a series of parameterized turns while maintaining their virtual vehicle centered between the two red lines delineating the \"road\" edge.","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual Reality Driving Task"]},{"label":"Virtual Reality (VR) Driving Task: Healthy Control Cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Healthy controls with no vision loss will perform a driving task in VR, in which they must steer through a series of parameterized turns while maintaining their virtual vehicle centered between the two red lines delineating the \"road\" edge.","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual Reality Driving Task"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual Reality Driving Task","description":"Participants will steer a virtual car with the goal of staying in the center of a single-lane roadway while traveling at a constant speed of 26.6 m/s (approximately 60 miles/hr). The roadway alternates between a series of straights and turns of different radii to both the left and the right. This allows for careful control of task difficulty, and for the repeated presentation of specific conditions across multiple \"trials\" (i.e. turns in the road) in a randomized order. In addition, the density of the visual texture elements in the virtual environment that provide optic flow (OF) signal is also varied. The low-density OF condition has no road texture or foliage, and only the solid road edges on a flat-black ground plane. The medium-density OF condition has sparse textural elements distributed on the ground plane, and the high-density OF condition has high density road texture and a canopy of road-side trees that provide texture extending far above the horizon.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual Reality (VR) Driving Task: Cortically Blind Cohort","Virtual Reality (VR) Driving Task: Healthy Control Cohort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Virtual Reality (VR) Lane Deviation / Offset","description":"Virtual lane offset is a measure of driving accuracy, which involves computing the divergence (in virtual meters) from the center of the single-lane virtual roadway, relative to the position of the driver's head and averaged over the duration of each turn.
