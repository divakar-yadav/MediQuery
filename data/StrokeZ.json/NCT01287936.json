A second purpose is to determine whether SB623 might improve stroke symptoms. Chronic, stable ischemic stroke patients must be between 6 and 60 months after their stroke, and with only this one prior stroke, and with no further improvement from physical therapy.","detailedDescription":"Chronic, stable stroke patients have no existing alternative treatments after rehabilitation therapy. SB623, a modified stem cell preparation, has been shown to improve motor function when administered in animal models of stable stroke. Safety studies in animals have shown no adverse events attributed to SB623. Patients who meet the entry criteria for this study will have regular examinations, radiological evaluations (CT, MRI, PET), and be followed for two years. Regular neurological evaluations will also be done using standard questionnaires, with occasional video recording if improvements are evident. Key entry criteria for this study, in addition to 6-60 months post-ischemic stroke, include moderately severe symptoms--e.g., difficulty standing or walking, and/or difficulty using arms or hands, and/or speech impediments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Chronic Stroke","Stable Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Fixed Motor Deficits"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SB623 Implant (2.5M)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2.5 million SB623 cells","interventionNames":["Biological: SB623"]},{"label":"SB623 Implant (5.0M)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"5 million SB623 cells","interventionNames":["Biological: SB623"]},{"label":"SB623 Implant (10.0M)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10 million SB623 cells","interventionNames":["Biological: SB623"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"SB623","description":"SB623, a modified stem-cell product","armGroupLabels":["SB623 Implant (10.0M)","SB623 Implant (2.5M)","SB623 Implant (5.0M)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","description":"Number of subjects with TEAEs by maximum severity.
