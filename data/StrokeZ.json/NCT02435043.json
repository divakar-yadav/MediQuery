The intervention is grounded in environmental psychology and occupational therapy, supported by a multimodal rehabilitation team that utilizes the garden/nature for sensory stimulation, body awareness, meaningful occupations and nature experiences.\n\nThe enrollment of 101 patients (51 intervention; 50 control) was completed on August 2014. Follow-up is on-going, with assessments by examiner blinded to treatment group, at end of intervention period, 8 months, and 14 months after randomization. A parallel study with qualitative in-depth interviews in a subset of patients, who were randomized to the intervention group, as well as the staff, is also ongoing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":101,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nature based rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ten weeks of nature-based rehabilitation, as add-on to standard management","interventionNames":["Other: Nature based rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Treatment as usual","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"standard management after stroke","interventionNames":["Other: standard management after stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Nature based rehabilitation","description":"ten weeks of nature-based rehabilitation, as add-on to standard management.
