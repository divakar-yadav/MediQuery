IV rtPA is the only drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke but it does not work very well in cases where the stroke is caused by a large vessel occlusion. The hypothesis being tested is to determine if the addition of a treatment by a mechanical thrombectomy device like the Penumbra System can improve the clinical outcome of the patient over just using IV rtPA alone.","detailedDescription":"Current therapies for acute stroke are limited to the intravenous administration of a intravenous (IV) recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) for thrombolysis of the affected cerebral arteries within 3-4.5 hours from symptom onset, and the use of intra-arterial (IA) endovascular mechanical clot retrieval devices within 8 hours from ictus, all of which have limitations as mono therapies. For example, IV rtPA may not be very efficacious in large vessel occlusion and the long term effects of mechanical thrombectomy devices on patient functional outcome is unknown. This is a randomized, concurrent controlled study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System as adjunctive therapy to IV rtPA in the acute intervention of acute ischemic stroke. Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke who have evidence of a large clot burden (clot length \\> 8mm) in the anterior circulation will be assigned to either IV rtPA therapy alone (0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg) or a combined IV rtPA therapy (0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg) and intra-arterial (IA) adjunctive treatment with the Penumbra System. Each treated patient will be followed and assessed for 3 months after enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","acute intervention","thrombolysis","rtPA","internal carotid artery","middle cerebral artery","mechanical thrombectomy","Penumbra System","clot length","mRS","NIHSS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":108,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IV rtPA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV infusion of rtPA at 0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg","interventionNames":["Drug: intravenous (IV) recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)"]},{"label":"IV rtPA and IA Penumbra System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dual IV rtPA therapy (0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg) and IA adjunctive treatment with the Penumbra System","interventionNames":["Device: Penumbra System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"intravenous (IV) recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)","description":"0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg","armGroupLabels":["IV rtPA"],"otherNames":["recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, Alteplase"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Penumbra System","description":"The Penumbra System is an aspiration based mechanical thrombectomy device","armGroupLabels":["IV rtPA and IA Penumbra System"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Good Functional Outcome as Defined by a Modified Rankin Score of 0-2","description":"The assessor is blinded to patient treatment assignment.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of All Serious Adverse Events","description":"A Serious Adverse Event is defined as an event that:\n\n1.
