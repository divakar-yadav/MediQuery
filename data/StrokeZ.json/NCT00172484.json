The aims of this study are (1) to set up a multidisciplinary stroke team in a well-designed stroke center for stroke care; (2) to establish a systemic stroke prevention / education protocol based on people's awareness of stroke; and (3) to create a better stroke rehabilitation protocol and pathway.there are three components in rehabilitation projects. First, we want to identify potential factors related to functional outcome in patients with stroke before and after stroke center. Second, we want to compare the functional outcome in patients who admit to the stroke center as to those admitted to the general ward. Third, we want to investigate the effect of electrical stimulation on upper limb function in patient with acute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["cerebrovascular accident","stroke center","stroke team","intensive care of stroke","rehabilitation of stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"education program","description":"A well-designed questionnaire concerning about awareness of stroke symptoms, knowledge, and management was done in adults of stroke victims' family members and general population."},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"nursing program","description":"To establish a systemic stroke prevention, education protocol"},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"rehabilitation program","description":"From a sample of 648 stroke patients who were referred to rehabilitation between November 2002 and October 2002, 345 charts were successfully reviewed. Besides, 126 subjects were randomly selected and successfully contacted for telephone follow-up; and data from 87 subjects of telephone survey were included for statistical analysis. Comparison of functional status between early rehabilitation and ordinary scheduled rehabilitation for acute stroke patients was done from admission to 3 months after stroke onset. The efficacy of early application of electric stimulation for the upper paralyzed extremity was performed."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bureau Of Health Promotion,Department of Health , R.O.C.","timeFrame":"2003/08/29；2004/02/02；2004/08/26；2004/12/03；2005/06/12；2005/11/22"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute stroke\n* age \\> 18 y/o\n* consult rehabilitation\n* client or agent can sign a letter of consent\n\nExclusion Criteria(for rehabilitation protocol):\n\n* contraindication of electrical stimulation(pacemaker implant, severe arrhythmia, malignant cancer, wound on stimulation site)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ping-Keung Yip","affiliation":"Department of Neurology, National Taiwan Univisity Hospital","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Stroke Intensive Care Unit","city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
