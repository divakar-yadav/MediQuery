During the course of therapy, user's attempts to move and complete exercises are assisted by neuromuscular electrical stimulation.","detailedDescription":"This pilot study quantifies functional gains induced by the Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy (EAMT), an extension of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy to moderately-to-severely paralyzed patients in their stable plateau phase of recovery. During EAMT, patients can assist affected upper limb movements through functional electrical stimulation. Initially, patients are divided in two groups. One of the groups receives EAMT, the other receives the best possible physical and occupational therapy. Therapy consists in 40 sessions of 45 minutes twice per day over five weeks, including a one-week therapy break. After 20 sessions, group allocation is crossed-over, and patients don't receive any therapy for one week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EAMT, then standard care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy precedes usual and customary care.","interventionNames":["Other: Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy","Other: Usual and customary care"]},{"label":"Standard care, then EAMT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual and customary care precedes Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy","Other: Usual and customary care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy","description":"Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy (EAMT) is an extension of conventional Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) for moderately-to-severely paralyzed patients.
