The participants have already had a stroke or TIA, and have uncontrolled blood pressure, as well as problems with memory and problem-solving, or miss taking medications, or who do not believe in the effectiveness of their medications. Interventions focus on motivational interviewing, adherence counseling with memory cuing, and self-monitoring of blood pressure.","detailedDescription":"* randomized, controlled trial at 4 sites\n* measurement of blood pressure, missed pills, self-efficacy rating at baseline and 6 months\n* contacting family pharmacists to evaluate prescription renewal patterns at baseline and 6 months"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Blood Pressure"],"keywords":["hypertension","stroke","adherence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adherence counseling","interventionNames":["Behavioral: lifestyle counseling, home blood pressure monitoring"]},{"label":"Usual care","interventionNames":["Behavioral: lifestyle counseling, home blood pressure monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"lifestyle counseling, home blood pressure monitoring","description":"monthly telephone counseling over 6 months for intervention group no health provider initiated contact for control group","armGroupLabels":["Adherence counseling","Usual care"],"otherNames":["motivational interviewing"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"blood pressure","timeFrame":"6 months from baseline testing"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"self-efficacy rating","timeFrame":"6 months from baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosis of stroke or TIA\n* hypertension\n* Montreal Cognitive Assessment score less than 26\n* self report of missed pills\n* self-efficacy rating less than 100%\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* inability to give informed consent\n* 18 years of age or younger","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"clients recruited from Stroke Prevention Clinics in Ontario with diagnosis of Stroke or TIA, Hypertension, and cognitive deficits as indicated by MoCA score \\< 26, self-efficacy rating \\< 100%, and self-report of missed pills; English speaking; able to give informed consent; older than 18 years of age","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Royal Victoria Hospital","city":"Barrie","state":"Ontario","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":44.40011,"lon":-79.66634}},{"facility":"Hamilton General Hospital, 237 Barton St East","city":"Hamilton","state":"Ontario","zip":"L8L 2X2","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.25011,"lon":-79.84963}},{"facility":"Lakeridge Health Centre","city":"Oshawa","state":"Ontario","zip":"L1G 2B9","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.90012,"lon":-78.84957}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006973","term":"Hypertension"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","asFound":"Hypertension","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
