The patient will then be randomized to one of the following groups: \\[ extended sigh then CPAP \\] or \\[ CPAP then extended sigh \\] (random order of ARMs - each patient becoming their own control). In order to homogenize the settings, the mechanical ventilation will be standardized with in particular the use of a PEEP of 6 cmH2O before inclusion and between the ARMs (for a duration of at least 10 minutes in each case).\n\nHemodynamic values will be recorded during the last 10 seconds of each procedure. Once the two ARMs have been performed, the rest of the management will then be left to the discretion of the practitioner in charge of the patient.\n\nThe included patient will be managed according to the recommendations at the time of the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Output","Decreased Cardiac Output","Hemodynamic Monitoring","Blood Pressure","Stroke Volume","Major Abdominal Surgery","Mechanical Ventilation","Hemodynamic Optimization"],"keywords":["mechanical ventilation,","hemodynamics,","ARM,","CPAP,","extended sigh,","cardiac output"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Exploratory study testing in cross-sectional design two alveolar recruitment maneuvers referenced in practice, in patients under general anesthesia and intubated under controlled ventilation, in operating room","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) then extended sigh","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients assigned to this group will receive a CPAP ARM (40cmH2O during 50 seconds), followed by a 10-minute pause corresponding to a period of return to basal state.\n\nThen an ARM by extended sigh (e-sigh) also 50 seconds (driving pressure at 10cmH2O and successive PEEP levels at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30cmH2O, with respiratory frequency fixed at 30/min in controlled pressure).\n\nHemodynamic (blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume) and ventilatory measurements will be performed the last 10 seconds of each recruitment maneuver.","interventionNames":["Procedure: alveolar recruitment maneuver"]},{"label":"extended sigh then continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients assigned to this group will receive an ARM by extended sigh (e-sigh) during 50 seconds (driving pressure at 10cmH2O and successive PEEP levels at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30cmH2O, with respiratory frequency fixed at 30/min in controlled pressure), followed by a 10-minute pause corresponding to a period of return to basal state.\n\nThen they receive a CPAP ARM (40cmH2O during 50 seconds).
