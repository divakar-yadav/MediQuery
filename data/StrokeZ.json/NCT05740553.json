Investigators will take three days to teach participants how to use the system. Each week for the remainder of the 6 weeks, participants will use this system for 4+ days per week on their own, and for 1 day supervised. During each supervised day, participants will complete approximately 1 hour of training while supervised over video chat with researchers.\n\nParticipants' tactile function will be assessed at three separate time points: once within one week before beginning training, once within one week after completing training, as well as once either 8 weeks before or 8 weeks after the training. This assessment has a required survey component, as well as an optional in-person clinical assessment component."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Chronic Brain Injury","Peripheral Neuropathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Participants complete tactile training for 6-8 weeks, and complete no additional training for 8 weeks.
