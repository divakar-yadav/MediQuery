All patients will have a baseline stroke severity measured as NIH Stroke scale score \\> 5. Patients will treated according to the best standard of care including concurrent treatment with intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis where appropriate. The primary outcome will be determined at 3 months. The primary hypothesis is that, using the composite outcome of a modified Rankin score 0-1 or NIH stroke scale score 0-1 at 3 months (or both), the proportion of patients with improved outcomes will be greater by 10% or more in the active treatment group. \\[The current trial is termed \"Part 2\" and incorporates revisions to the initial protocol that were instituted after the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) suspended subject recruitment because of a safety concern after 434 subjects had been enrolled. The protocol revisions of Part 2 resulted from the study team's thorough review of the Part-1 safety data and were designed to optimize safety going forward.\\]"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":841,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Albumin (ALB)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Albumin (human albumin, 25% solution, 2.0 g/kg), infused intravenously over a period of 2 hours","interventionNames":["Biological: Albumin"]},{"label":"Saline","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Saline (isotonic solution), 8 ml/kg, infused intravenously over a 2-hour period","interventionNames":["Drug: Saline"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Albumin","description":"human albumin, 25%, 2.0g/kg intravenously (or equivalent volume of saline control), infused over 2 h, commencing within 5 hours of stroke onset","armGroupLabels":["Albumin (ALB)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Saline","description":"equivalent volume of isotonic saline control","armGroupLabels":["Saline"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Number of Participants With Favorable Outcome Defined as National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score of 0-1 and/or Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-1.","description":"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit.
