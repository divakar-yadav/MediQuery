Pablo is a new VR game combined with motion sensor system which can detect subject's activities. Unlike commercial camera systems such as Kinect or XBOX, the systems require a continuous sightline or enough active range of motion which may increase risk of compensatory movement. Few of studies had investigated the rehabilitation effects on upper extremity with Pablo for patients with stroke.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality upper extremity training through Pablo system in patients with chronic stroke.","detailedDescription":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality upper extremity training through Pablo system in patients with chronic stroke.\n\nMETHODS:Patients with mild to moderate motor deficits were recruited and randomly assigned to \"VR plus standard rehabilitation group\"(n=19), and \"standard rehabilitation group\" (n=19). After 12 training sessions (60 minutes a time, 2 times a week), the performance was assessed by a blinded assessor. The outcome measures included Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb section(FMAUE), Box and block test(BBT), Dynanometer, active range of motion of shoulder and elbow,and Stroke Impact Scale.Modified Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale and adverse effect were recorded after each sessions.Collected data will be analyzed with sample T test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"virtual reality group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard treatment 30 minutes plus virtual reality game 30 minutes, twice a week for 9 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: virtual reality game traning","Behavioral: standard treatment"]},{"label":"standard treatment group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard treatment 60 minutes, twice a week for 9 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: standard treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"virtual reality game traning","description":"The controllers were attached to upper extremity to control the game.
