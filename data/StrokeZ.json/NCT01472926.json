No other clinical trial is currently evaluating alternative thrombolytic strategies in patients who are eligible to receive standard intravenous alteplase, instead concentrating on extending the population for IV thrombolysis.\n\nThe ATTEST pilot phase will use brain imaging as a biomarker for key clinical response variables, with penumbral salvage as the primary end-point and secondary end-points including recanalisation as well as conventional clinical scales.\n\nThe findings of this study are anticipated to provide data on sample size and event rates to inform the design of a definitive, confirmatory, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial with clinical endpoints."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischaemic stroke","stroke","thrombolysis","thrombolytic drug therapy","CT perfusion","CT angiography","brain imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg (single bolus, maximum 25 mg)","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Alteplase 0.9 mg/kg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus and 90% as IV infusion over 1 hour, maximum 90 mg)","interventionNames":["Drug: alteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Intravenous (IV) tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg (single bolus;
