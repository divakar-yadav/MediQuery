These wristbands detect your pulse based on a technique called \"photoplethysmography,\" (PPG). PPG is a common method in which an individual's pulse is detected based on a light signature interpreted by the wristband. Most commercially available heart rate monitors use PPG to determine your heart rate, but the accuracy is variable."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Cardioversion","BodyGuardian","Amiigo Wristband"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cardioversion","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Amiigo watch during atrial fibrillation cardioversion.
