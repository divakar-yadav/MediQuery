A recent trial indicated that clopidogrel and aspirin treatment reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased hemorrhage events, compared with aspirin monotherapy. Apixaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants with less risk of bleeding events.\n\nTo estimate whether apixaban is beneficial for acute TIA or minor stroke, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial has been designed. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that a 21-days apixaban regimen is superior to clopidogrel and aspirin dual-therapy for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular event.","detailedDescription":"The ADANCE study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 3,000 Chinese patients. Two subtypes of patients will be enrolled: I, acute disabling ischemic stroke (\\<24 hours of symptoms onset); II, acute TIA (\\<24 hours of symptoms onset).\n\nPatients will be randomized into 3 groups:\n\nⅠ Receiving a 75 mg dose of clopidogrel and 75mg dose of aspirin from day 1 to day 21, with placebo apixaban twice daily.\n\nⅡ Receiving a 2.5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 21.\n\nⅢ Receiving a 5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 21.\n\nFrom day 22 to 3 months, all patients will receive 75-mg dose of clopidogrel long-term antiplatelet therapy.\n\nThe primary efficacy end point is percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage) at 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","TIA"],"keywords":["apixaban","clopidogrel","aspirin","new oral anticoagulant","TIA","acute minor ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual-antiplatelet Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Receiving a 75 mg dose of clopidogrel and 75mg dose of aspirin from day 1 to day 21, with placebo apixaban twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Clopidogrel","Drug: Aspirin","Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"Apixaban 2.5mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving a 2.5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 21","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban","Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"Apixaban 5mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving a 5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 21","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban","Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban 2.5mg","Apixaban 5mg"],"otherNames":["Eliquis","BMS-562247","BMS-562247-01"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Clopidogrel","description":"an irreversible inhibitor of the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor","armGroupLabels":["Dual-antiplatelet Therapy"],"otherNames":["Plavix","Clopivid"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","armGroupLabels":["Dual-antiplatelet Therapy"],"otherNames":["Acetylsalicylic acid"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban 2.5mg","Apixaban 5mg","Dual-antiplatelet Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage)","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of patients with new clinical vascular events (ischemic stroke/hemorrhagic stroke/TIA/myocardial infarction/vascular death)","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Percentage of patients with new clinical vascular events (ischemic stroke/hemorrhagic stroke/TIA/myocardial infarction/vascular death)","timeFrame":"30 days and 90 days"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS scores","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"moderate to severe bleeding events","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Total mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Adverse events/severe adverse events reported by the investigators","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult subjects (male or female ≥18 years old)\n* Acute nondisabling ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤3 at the time of randomization) that can be treated with study drug within 24 hours of symptoms onset.
