As the extent of its effect is unknown, the investigators will use clinical outcome, serum biochemical markers and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI)to determine the extent of its neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory effect.","detailedDescription":"BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury contributed to perioperative morbidity and mortality in Carotid Artery Stenting. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning protects the brain injury in patients undergoing elective Carotid Artery Stenting, a randomized trial will be performed in current study.\n\nDESIGNING 60 patients will be randomized to Carotid Artery Stenting with RIPC group or conventional Carotid Artery Stenting group (control). RIPC consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm ischemia/reperfusion, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right upper arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins. Cerebral injury was assessed by S-100b, NSE, hs-CRP and MMSE test in different time points."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","TIA","Coronary Stenosis"],"keywords":["MMSE","NSE","S100B","hsCRP","DWI-MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Device: RIPC RIPC consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm ischemia/reperfusion, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right upper arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins Procedure: Carotid Artery Stenting","interventionNames":["Device: remote limb ischemic preconditioning","Procedure: Carotid Artery Stenting"]},{"label":"2","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Procedure: Carotid Artery Stenting","interventionNames":["Procedure: Carotid Artery Stenting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"remote limb ischemic preconditioning","description":"Remote limb ischemic preconditioning consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm ischemia/reperfusion, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right upper arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Carotid Artery Stenting","description":"Carotid Artery Stenting is an invasive therapy of carotid stenosis.","armGroupLabels":["1","2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"cognitive disorder assessment","description":"1.The Mini-Mental State Examination( MMSE) test: The difference in MMSE score among patients treated with preconditioning and those not treated.","timeFrame":"2 days"},{"measure":"serum biomarkers","description":"Serum biomarkers of brain injury and flammatory: The difference in NSE, S-100b and hs-CRP level among patients treated with preconditioning and those not treated.","timeFrame":"2 days"},{"measure":"new brain lesions","description":"The new lesions at DWI-MRI within postoperation 48 hours: The difference in new lesions in the DWI-MRI 48 hours postoperatively among patients treated with preconditioning and those not treated.","timeFrame":"2DAYS"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"composite endpoint of any stroke,MI,or death","description":"The composite endpoint of any stroke ,MI, or death at 30-day and 90-day after the procedure.","timeFrame":"3months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:Patients referred for elective Carotid Artery Stenting were participate in the study at the time of scheduling for operation.\n\n1.
