GLP-1 has convincing effects on the high glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients and is well tolerated. New animal studies indicate a protective effect of GLP-1 in the brain and the heart. The mechanism behind this is yet not known.\n\nThe study hypothesis is that during hypoglycaemia GLP-1 will stimulate glucose-uptake in the brain and heart independent of insulin and thereby exert protective effects in the brain.","detailedDescription":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2D is a disease characterized by an immense growing prevalence world wide. T2D is associated with a three-fold increase in cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction and stroke) leading to significantly higher morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. The prospective British Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that neither diet alone nor the pharmaceutical treatment utilized (Sulphonylurea, Metformin, Insulin) were able to reduce these macrovascular complications. GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide-1)is an incretin with convincing effects on glycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients with little or no risk of hypoglycaemia. New research in animal models has shown a potential protective effect in the brain and heart in association with ischaemic damage. The mechanism behind this protective effect is not known. During hypoglycaemia the brain lacks glucose which is the main fuel for sufficient brain function. The brain will compensate by increasing glucose uptake across the blood brain barrier and similarly in the heart.\n\nThe effect of native GLP-1 on glucose uptake in the brain and heart will by visualized by fluoro-deoxy-glucose FDG-PET-scan during hypoglycaemia in healthy men. At the same time a pancreatic/pituitary clamp will be performed. The hypothesis is that GLP-1 directly will stimulate glucose uptake independent of the pancreatic hormones and through this mechanism exert neuro- and cardioprotective actions.\n\nComparisons: FDG-uptake in the brain and heart with GLP-1 infusion compared to placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes","Stroke","Myocardial Infarction"],"keywords":["GLP-1","glucose metabolism","Type 2 diabetes","brain","PET"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: glucagon-like-peptide-1"]},{"label":"P","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"glucagon-like-peptide-1","description":"intravenous infusion of 1.2pmol/kg/min for 7 hours","armGroupLabels":["A"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"intravenous infusion of 1.2pmol/kg/min","armGroupLabels":["P"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The acute effect of GLP-1 on glucose uptake in the brain","timeFrame":"1 hour"},{"measure":"The acute effect of GLP-1 on glucose uptake in the heart","timeFrame":"1 hour"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The acute effect of GLP-1 on glucose metabolic rate in the brain","timeFrame":"1 hour"},{"measure":"The acute effect of GLP-1 on intracerebral glucose concentration","timeFrame":"1 hour"},{"measure":"The acute effect of GLP-1 on lumped constant in the brain","timeFrame":"1 hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy men\n* Age 20-50 years\n* Caucasian\n* BMI 20-30 kg/m2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diabetes in subject and 1.degree relatives\n* Any disease of clinical relevance","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ole E Schmitz, MD, DSc","affiliation":"Department of pharmacology, Aarhus university","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of pharmacology, Aarhus university","city":"Aarhus","zip":"8000","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":56.15674,"lon":10.21076}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"24400077","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Gejl M, Lerche S, Mengel A, Moller N, Bibby BM, Smidt K, Brock B, Sondergaard H, Botker HE, Gjedde A, Holst JJ, Hansen SB, Rungby J.
