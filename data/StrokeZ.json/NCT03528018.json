Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique that has been used after stroke to promote excitability of the surviving neural architecture in order to support functional recovery. Interestingly, cortical excitability has been reported to increase when tDCS is combined with virtual reality. This synergetic effect could explain the promising results achieved by preliminary experimental interventions that combined both approaches on upper limb rehabilitation after stroke. The objective of this study is to explore the use of these interventions in subjects with severe hemiparesis and to determine its efficacy in comparison to conventional physical therapy"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Chronic Stroke","Upper Limb Injury"],"keywords":["Virtual Reality","Rehabilitation","Physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"OTHER","description":"Conventional physical therapy","interventionNames":["Other: Physical therapy"]},{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combined tDCS and VR-based intervention","interventionNames":["Device: REACt system","Other: Physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"REACt system","description":"The REACt system is a virtual reality-based paradigm for upper limb rehabilitation that allows for interaction of individuals with restricted movements from active responses triggered when they attempt to perform a movement.
