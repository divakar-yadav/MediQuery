The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* The alteration of cortical activation during swallowing in patients with LMS compared with healthy subjects.\n* The alteration of cortical functional connectivity during swallowing in patients with LMS compared with healthy subjects.\n\nfNIRS will be used to detect cortical activation and functional connectivity during swallowing tasks in LMS patients and healthy subjects, and to compare the differences between patients and healthy subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Deglutition Disorders","Lateral Medullary Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LMS patients","description":"The demographic characteristics will be collected, including sex, age, stroke duration, and lesion side; Penetration-aspiration (PAS) scale will be used to evaluate swallowing function. fNIRS will be used to detect changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) during rest and voluntary swallowing.","interventionNames":["Other: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detection"]},{"label":"healthy subjects","description":"The demographic characteristics will be collected, including sex and age. fNIRS will be used to detect changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) during rest and voluntary swallowing.","interventionNames":["Other: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detection","description":"fNIRS( NirScan Danyang Huichuang Medical Equipment Co.

The steps will be used to preprocess the data including: deleting irrelevant time intervals and unrelated artifacts; turning the intensity of light into optical density; choosing the band-pass filter to filter the noise and interference signals (0.01-0.2 Hz); translating optical density to the oxygen concentration in the blood; and setting the initial time of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to 30 s and the end time to 60 s (the time for a single block paradigm). To analyze the HbO2 time-series data, a generalized linear model (GLM) will be used. The GLM could calculate the degree of matching between the experimental and ideal HRF values for each task and participant. The beta value, which represents the channel's level of cortical activation, will be utilized to estimate the HRF prediction of the HbO2 signal and can be used to represent the HRF function's peak value.","timeFrame":"day 1"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"functional connectivity during swallowing","description":"The Network module of NirSpark software was used to extract the HbO2
