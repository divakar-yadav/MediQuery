Because of its lipophilicity, it has high penetrance of blood-brain barrier. Animal model studies have shown that minocycline can reduce cerebral damage after ischemic stroke, and its mechanism involves multiple molecular pathways, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti apoptotic pathways, and protection of blood-brain barrier. Clinical studies have also shown that minocycline can significantly improve 3-month National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of patients with ischemic stroke, indicating that minocycline is a potential neuroprotective drug. Minocycline is believed to protect the blood-brain barrier, thereby reducing the ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by mechanical thrombectomy. However, whether minocycline can become a synergistic treatment method of mechanical thrombectomy, there is no clinical research in this area at present. Therefore, investigators carry out the study on the effect of minocycline in patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke after mechanical thrombectomy, and plan to enroll 180 patients. To explore the safety and effectiveness of minocycline in patients with acute ischemic stroke after thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Minocycline","Mechanical thrombectomy","Anterior circulation","Neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"In this study, the outcome of minocycline group and routine treatment group was compared.
