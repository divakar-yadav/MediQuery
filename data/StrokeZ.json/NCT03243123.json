Twenty-three participants with subacute or chronic stroke received 20 min passive mobilization of the paretic hand with robotic assistance. After the intervention, significant improvements were found in forearm perfusion, muscle tone significantly decreased and subjects reported decreased upper limb heaviness, stiffness and pain. This study supports novel evidence that hand robotic assistance promotes local forearm circulation, may help in the management of spasticity and acutely alleviates reported symptoms of heaviness, stiffness and pain in subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Passive mobilization","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Upper limb passive mobilization assisted with robotic device","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic passive mobilization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic passive mobilization","description":"The intervention was performed using the Gloreha (Idrogenet, Italy) robotic system.
