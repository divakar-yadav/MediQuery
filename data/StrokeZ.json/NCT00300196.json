The analyses were reviewed by the data safety monitoring board, which recommended that both studies be terminated because of futility. This was done at a point where 650 subjects had been entered into both studies, combined, but analyses were conducted only on the initial 500 subjects. Results of the abbreviated analysis will be found with study NCT00141001 since that study contributed most of the subjects to the analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Ischemia","Brain Infarction"],"keywords":["Stroke","Fibrinogen","Reperfusion","Thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":311,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intravenous ancrod","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous ancrod infused at a rate of 0.167 IU/kg/hr (0.6 mL/kg/hr) for 2 or 3 hours depending on the pretreatment fibrinogen level.","interventionNames":["Biological: Ancrod (Viprinex)"]},{"label":"Intravenous Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous placebo at a rate of 0.6 mL/kg/hr for 2 or 3 hours depending on the pretreatment fibrinogen level.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Ancrod (Viprinex)","description":"0.167 IU/kg/hr IV for 2-3 hours","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous ancrod"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"0.6 mL/kg/hr","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Score -
