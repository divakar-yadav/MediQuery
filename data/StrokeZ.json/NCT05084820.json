This \"dual activation\" characteristic of mirror neuron helps in improving the observation and execution of different actions.\n\naim of this study is to determine the effects of action observation treatment on motor function in upper limb of patients with chronic stroke.\n\nAn RCT will be conducted on 14 chronic stroke patients from Omar Hospital and Riphah Rehabilitation Centre Lahore. Patients will be randomly allocated into control group (n=7) and Experimental group (n=7) by lottery method. Control group will be given only conventional treatment that included stretching, strengthening, pinching, gripping, reaching and grasping exercises, while Experimental group received conventional treatment and action observation treatment 3 days/ week for 4 weeks. Treatment outcomes will be assessed on Modified Barthel Index and Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","action observation treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"each participant will be requested to draw either number one or two from a box.number one refers to group A and number two refers to group B.
