During standard rehabilitative physical therapy sessions.","detailedDescription":"This research aims at assessing and fine tuning the effectiveness of a unique tool for online guidance of neural rehabilitation. The tool monitors patient attention level and guides the therapist online regarding the effectiveness of the current exercise employed. It is well established that maintaining a high level of attention plays a major role in the clinical outcome in rehabilitation. The monitoring is achieved using a cheap and simple to use EEG system and a breakthrough signal processing algorithm. The feedback provides the caregiver and patient with online information regarding the effectiveness of attention recruited during a given exercise. Furthermore, the investigators are developing and fine-tuning a set of guidelines to attain optimal attention levels. These guide lines include : Choosing an appropriate goal/movement for each patient; Regulating the optimal degree of effort by changing the difficulty level of the exercise, changing the exercise or suggesting a short rest period; Integrating supportive exercises such as stretches, strengthening of stabilizers normalization of muscle tone, sensory stimulation etc. which may enhance the performance of the target goal/movement; Motivating patients to exert more effort; And taking advantage of the quality control aspect of the BEI index in-order to augment attention of both therapist and patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Stroke","On-line EEG","BEI index","Attention","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard physical therapy treatment with feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard physical therapy rehabilitation is administered to stroke patients.
