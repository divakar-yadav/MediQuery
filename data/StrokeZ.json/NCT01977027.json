This study will help us better understand what kinds of sensory information can help with the re-learning of grasping with the affected hand despite the sensory difficulties produced by the stroke.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to develop, refine and test the 'alternate hand training strategy' to facilitate adaptation, repetition and relearning to restore hand function after stroke. The three aims are: to restore adaptation (Aim 1), facilitate grasp efficiency and normal directional biases during repetition (Aim 2), and enhance the rate of learning to improve hand function and quality of life post stroke (Aim 3).\n\nHypotheses: We hypothesize that alternate hand training will increase the rate of learning and lead to greater improvement in hand function. The results will inform dosing of therapy for optimal relearning."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke With Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Fingers","Grasp","Strength","Hand Function","Motor Function","Post Stroke","Brain Infraction","Biomechanis","Neuronal Plasticity","Weight-Bearing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":91,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke & age-matched Controls","type":"OTHER","description":"Alternate Hand Training or Affected Hand Training:\n\n40 patients with stroke and 40 control subjects will participate over 7 visits.
