In this study, patients with stroke will perform pedaling exercise on the UCFit device prior to and then for a period of twelve weeks after discharge to home from inpatient rehabilitation. Differing levels of feedback will be provided to study subjects and corresponding changes in the amount of pedaling and walking performed will be identified. The results of this study will offer insight into the activity levels of disabled persons in their home environments. Furthermore, it will help in the identification of strategies that can increase activity levels in the critical period after discharge to home."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["disability","walking","feedback","exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Detailed feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will pedal on the UCFit with a goal of 30 total minutes of daily exercise.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Detailed feedback"]},{"label":"Basic feedback","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will pedal on the UCFit with a goal of 30 total minutes of daily exercise.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Basic feedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Detailed feedback","description":"Once a week subjects will receive feedback about the total time spent cycling and walking in the previous week.
