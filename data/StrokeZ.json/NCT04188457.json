These reasons explain the lack of significant progress in preventing recurrences, preventable complications (heart failure and arrhythmias after MI; falls, sphincter and swallowing disorders, dementia and arrhythmias after stroke) and re-admission. This observation is aggravated by problems of medical demography and therefore the availability of neurologists, cardiologists and general practitioners.\n\nLocal and foreign experiments have demonstrated the value of intensive, coordinated and multi-professional stroke and MI monitoring, including nurses, in terms of: better control of risk factors and reduction of the rate of re-hospitalization by recurrence in stroke follow-up; improvement of the patient's general condition, control of risk factors, reduction in the number of events, decrease in the number of re-hospitalizations and their duration in MI follow-up. The value of pharmacists' additional intervention in intensive post-MI follow-up compared to routine follow-up has also been demonstrated, particularly in terms of significant improvement in patient compliance.\n\nThe hypothesis is that 2 years of intensive follow-up for both post-stroke or post-MI patients, by trained hospital and liberal nurses, in conjunction with doctors and pharmacists, is of medico-economic interest compared to usual follow-up. Therefore a medico-economic evaluation was designed to evaluate the efficiency of this model, which combines community-based and recourse care, prevention and coordination of care compared to usual follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accidents","Myocardial Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1720,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke - usual follow-up","description":"Patient with either primary stroke, recurrent stroke, hemorrhagic, ischemic or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) with regular follow-up","interventionNames":["Other: Usual follow-up"]},{"label":"Stroke - intensive follow-up","description":"Patient with either primary stroke, recurrent stroke, hemorrhagic, ischemic or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) with intensive follow-up","interventionNames":["Other: Intensive follow-up"]},{"label":"myocardial infarction - usual follow-up","description":"Patient who has had a first or recurrent myocardial infarction with usual follow-up","interventionNames":["Other: Usual follow-up"]},{"label":"myocardial infarction -intensive follow-up","description":"Patient who has had a first or recurrent myocardial infarction with intensive follow-up","interventionNames":["Other: Intensive follow-up"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual follow-up","description":"2 medical consultations (nurse and doctor) over 24 months","armGroupLabels":["Stroke - usual follow-up","myocardial infarction - usual follow-up"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intensive follow-up","description":"10 medical visits (nurse, doctor, pharmacist) over 24 months","armGroupLabels":["Stroke - intensive follow-up","myocardial infarction -intensive follow-up"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cost-utility ratio of the intensive monitoring strategy for each condition (stroke / myocardial infarction)","description":"24-month incremental cost-utility ratio associated with the intensive post-stroke or post-MI follow-up strategy compared to the usual post-stroke or post-MI follow-up strategy, expressed as cost per year of life gained in good health (costs / QALY, score measured using EQ-5D-5L®).","timeFrame":"24 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient or legal representative who has given oral consent\n* Patient over 18 years of age\n* Patient with:\n\n  * either a primary MI or a recurrent MI, not previously included, defined according to the criteria of the European Society of Cardiology and ICD-10\n  * either a primary stroke, a recurrent stroke not previously included, hemorrhagic, ischemic or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), defined according to WHO criteria, the TOAST score and the ICD-10, with a Rankin score \\< 5.\n* Patient followed up in one of the 6 public health establishments of the GHT 21-52 (regional group of hospitals) or at the Valmy clinic in Dijon also participating in the project\n* Patient with estimated survival beyond 12 months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A patient who is not affiliated to the national health insurance system;\n* A patient subject to legal protection (curatorship, guardianship)\n* To be a patient subject to a measure of judicial safeguard;\n* Pregnant, parturient or breastfeeding woman;\n* Admitted for a condition other than stroke, TIA and MI;\n* Experiencing heart failure before the MI;\n* Be managed in EHPAD before and/or after stroke or IDM.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients with stroke or myocardial infarction","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yannick BEJOT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03.80.29.37.53","phoneExt":"+33","email":"yannick.bejot@chu-dijon.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chu Dijon Bourgogne","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Dijon","zip":"21000","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Yannick BEJOT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03.80.29.37.53","phoneExt":"+33","email":"yannick.bejot@chu-dijon.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"Relevant anonymized individual participant data that underlie the results reported in the articles resulting from this clinical trial will be shared to researchers who provide a methodologically sound proposal, to achieve aims of the approved proposal, upon reasonnable request to the principal investigator (Prof. Yannick Béjot, yannick.bejot@chu-dijon.fr).
