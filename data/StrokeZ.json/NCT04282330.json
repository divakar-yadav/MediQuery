Ischaemic stokes are the most common type of stroke and occur when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood and oxygen your brain needs. This can lead to cellular death (infarction) so the quicker a stroke is diagnosed and treated, the better a patient's recovery is likely to be.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the technical feasibility of a new MRI technique known as Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) imaging for assessing the extent of potentially salvageable brain tissue (penumbra) around an area of infarction. CEST imaging works by looking at the chemicals in the brain cells. The chemicals may change when cells are affected by stroke. Stroke patients are not normally treated with with clotbusting drugs or clot-retrieving devices if they arrive at hospital many hours after the stroke because treatment may not help and in some cases it may cause more harm than good. However, the new MRI technique could detect those stroke patients who arrive at hospital many hours after the stroke but still have salvageable brain - in these cases it would be helpful to treat these patients and therefore stop those cells from dying.\n\nHowever, there are several technical issues that need to be addressed before CEST can be adopted as a routine clinical assessment. CEST in Stroke hopes to address these issues by using an alternate MRI sequence capable of acquiring CEST data over a large portion of the brain in approximately in 10 minutes.\n\nThe overall aim of study is to determine the feasibility of CEST imaging for assessing the extent of penumbra, in order to determine which patients may benefit from re-perfusion interventions who would otherwise not be eligible. If the study is successful, further research will be implemented to help clinical decision making in stroke patients who present outside of conventional time windows.","detailedDescription":"CEST in Stroke is an observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in acute ischaemic stroke patients.

The study will be described in detail and an information sheet provided. After being given sufficient time to consider participation, the participant or their consultee will be asked to complete a consent form. They will be given a copy of the consent form and information sheet for their records.\n\nA one off study visit will then take place. This will entail a 30 minute MRI scan in the King's College Hospital Clinical Research Facility. In addition, a brief neurological assessment (routine examination for all stroke patients) will also be performed and the following information collected: demographics, past medical history and any local laboratory results. The participant's clinical details will be recorded on a case report form (CRF). Any clinical information not provided by the participant will be completed using the patient's medical notes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CEST imaging performed","type":"OTHER","description":"CEST imaging will be performed (15 min): Axial 3D volume acquisition at 3.5 mm isotropic voxel size, 20-30 offset frequencies, plus Axial 3D T1w and T2w map at same resolution for use in CEST quantification.
