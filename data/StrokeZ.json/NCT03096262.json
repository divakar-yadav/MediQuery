By varying the tasks' features and affordances of a platform that combines a low-cost haptic device on one hand, and an online citizen science platform on the other, investigators will evaluate different strategies for social telerehabilitation. the two fundamental modes of social interaction - competition and cooperation - in addition to a control condition. Specifically, citizen science activities will be performed by competing, cooperating, or isolated users, and their rehabilitation effectiveness examined. Such effectiveness will be measured by (i) participants' rehabilitation performance (inferred from sensorimotor data acquired through the platform and directly quantified by a supervising therapist); (ii) participants' motivations to contribute (measured through surveys administered online); and (iii) participants' emotional well-being and sense of self-esteem (measured through online surveys)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis","Stroke"],"keywords":["cognitive skills","technical","internet platform","Stroke","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Output-Focus Condition","Behavioral: Input-Focus Condition"]},{"label":"Healthy Controls","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Output-Focus Condition","Behavioral: Input-Focus Condition"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Output-Focus Condition","description":"Users are asked to tag more, and force feedback is exerted the more points the user has","armGroupLabels":["Healthy Controls","Stroke Patients"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Input-Focus Condition","description":"Users are asked to tag more and force feedback is exerted based on the number of images the user has analyzed.","armGroupLabels":["Healthy Controls","Stroke Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer scale","description":"Stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
