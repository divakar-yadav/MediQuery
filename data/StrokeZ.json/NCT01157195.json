It has been shown to be efficacious for rehabilitating use of the more-affected arm in individuals more than one year after stroke with mild to moderate motor impairment. The first component of the therapy is intensive training in use of the more-affected arm on functional tasks for 3 hours daily for 10 consecutive weekdays. The second is wearing a protective safety mitt on the less-affected hand for all waking hours of the approximately 2-week treatment period that it is safe to do so. The purpose of the mitt is to discourage use of the less-affected arm. The third is a group of behavioral techniques designed to transfer gains from the treatment setting to the real world, which takes a therapist, on average, 30 minutes to implement on each treatment day.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to develop and test a method for automating the delivery of this efficacious treatment in a way that the therapy can be provided in stroke patients' homes. After developing an automated CI therapy workstation that has tele-health capabilities, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether CI therapy delivered in the home using this workstation with remote supervision by a therapist via an Internet-based audiovisual link provides outcomes that are just as good as CI therapy delivered by a \"live\" therapist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","chronic","arm","rehabilitation","tele-health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CI therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: CI therapy"]},{"label":"Tele-AutoCITE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"AutoCITE stands for Automated Constraint Induced Therapy Extender.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Tele-AutoCITE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Tele-AutoCITE","description":"Automated, remotely-administered form of CI therapy","armGroupLabels":["Tele-AutoCITE"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"CI therapy","description":"CI therapy is a behavioral approach to physical rehabilitation that has three components: 1. intense training of the more affected arm for several hours daily for multiple consecutive days, 2. restraint of the less affected arm during training hours and afterwards during the treatment period, 3.
