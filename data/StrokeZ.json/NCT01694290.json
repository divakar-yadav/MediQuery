These are used by athletic trainers, EMS personnel, ER staff, and people in the prehosoital setting.\n\nThe ability of these to cool a person has never been quantified, the efficiency and extent of cooling, as well as location of placement of ice packs is purely anecdotal. The purpose of this study is to determine whether strategically placed chemical ice packs will provide benefit to individuals subjected to heat stress."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heat Stroke, Heat Exhaustion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chemical Ice packs to neck, groin, axillae","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Chemical ice packs will be changed out every 9 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Chemical Cold Pack"]},{"label":"Chemical Ice Packs to cheeks, palms, soles","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Chemical Ice packs will be changed out every 9 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Chemical Cold Pack"]},{"label":"no chemical ice packs","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Chemical Cold Pack","armGroupLabels":["Chemical Ice Packs to cheeks, palms, soles","Chemical Ice packs to neck, groin, axillae"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Core body temperature cooling","timeFrame":"35 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* young healthy males \\> 18 years old with no active medical problems and able to run 10 km.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active medical problems or inability to exercise for 45 minutes in a heated room.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Stanford University","city":"Palo Alto","state":"California","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.44188,"lon":-122.14302}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25771030","type":"RESULT","citation":"Lissoway JB, Lipman GS, Grahn DA, Cao VH, Shaheen M, Phan S, Weiss EA, Heller HC.
