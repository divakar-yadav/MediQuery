Treatments for these problems are currently very limited. Limited studies to date suggest that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the side of the brain opposite to the side on which the stroke occurred may improve language function. The investigators are testing this hypothesis by giving daily 20 minute sessions of repeated TMS to the right (unaffected) side of the brain; the investigators test language function with a variety of tests both before and after the treatment with TMS and subjects are required to undergo functional MRI scans before and after treatment. TMS is a procedure in which a coil is placed next to the head of the subject and an electrical current passes through the coil causing a magnetic field that, in turn, causes a small electric current in the portion of the brain underneath the coil."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study involves two arms. The study involves a sham treatment control for half of the patients; all patients randomized to the sham treatment will be enrolled in the treatment phase after completing the sham treatment. Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm or the sham treatment arm of the study. There are 3 phases: a pre-treatment evaluation phase in which baseline language and imaging data are obtained and the optimal site for stimulation is determined; a treatment phase during which TMS is delivered on 10 occasions; and a post-treatment phase during which effects of the treatment will be assessed using behavioral measures as well as fMRI at 2 and 6-months. Participants in the sham arm will undergo the same behavioral testing, MRI, and fMRI that will be administered in the treatment protocol. After the 2-month follow up visit, patients in the sham arm will be told that they did not receive real TMS and will be offered the opportunity to enter the treatment arm.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The procedure for localizing the site of stimulation and TMS administration will be identical to the treatment arm, except the coil will be rotated 90 degrees during the process/administration.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active TMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"There are 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz active TMS are delivered to a previously determined optimal response site in right frontal lobe.","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham TMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"There are 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz TMS are delivered, however, the coil will be rotated 90 degrees during stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham TMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","description":"Active TMS will be at 90% motor threshold","armGroupLabels":["Active TMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham TMS","description":"Sham TMS will be administered","armGroupLabels":["Sham TMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Boston Naming Test","description":"The Boston Naming Test is an assessment of confrontation naming, where a score ranges from 0 (no items named correctly) to 36 (all items named correctly)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 2 months and 6-months after the last rTMS treatment session"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Picture Description of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam","description":"The picture description of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam is a measurement of spontaneous speech, elicited by a picture description.
