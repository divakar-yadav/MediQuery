In addition to the apparent benefits on bone health, WBV has been shown to increase muscle strength, postural control, muscular blood flow and oxygen uptake in various populations. Therefore, WBV can potentially be used as a tool to improve muscle strength, balance, and cardiovascular performance, especially for those with relatively low level of functioning. Stroke patients are therefore possible beneficiaries of WBV, as they often demonstrate muscle weakness, balance deficits, and poor cardiovascular function, in addition to bone loss. Only one pilot study has examined the effects of WBV in stroke patients. Van Nes et al.showed that postural stability in chronic stroke patients is improved after a few minutes of WBV at 30Hz and 3mm amplitude. The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine whether whole body vibration is beneficial in promoting bone turnover, physical fitness and neuromotor performance in patients with subacute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","bone","gait","muscle","vibration","motor balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"WBV","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In their regular physiotherapy sessions, the subjects in the experimental group will receive whole body vibration therapy for a duration of 4 weeks during their stay in the Tung Wah Hospital.","interventionNames":["Device: Whole body vibration therapy"]},{"label":"CON","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The subjects in this group will not receive whole body vibration therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: standing on the vibration platform but no vibration will be applied"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Whole body vibration therapy","description":"In their regular physiotherapy sessions, the subjects in the experimental group will receive WBV (20-240Hz, 10-minute sessions, 1 session per day, 5 sessions per week).
