Severity of cerebral infarction and poor prognosis is mainly associated with hyperglycemia caused by diabetes, which increases the Infarction volume and hemorrhagic trasformation.\n\nB. However, the effect of loergin blood glucose on reducing the Infarction volume and improving prognosis of cerebral infarction has not been proven.\n\nC. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a anti-stroke effect that reduces the Infarction volume using certain anti-diabetic drugs.\n\nD. Therefore, there is a possibility that certain anti-diabetic drugs may reduce the severity of cerebral infarction as a class effect in addition to the effect of blood sugar control.\n\nE. This is particularly likely to exist in the DPP-4 inhibitor family identified through preclinical studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction","Infarction, Brain","Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors"],"keywords":["Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors","Antidiabetic Drug"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22119,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DPP4i","description":"used DPP-4 inhibitors as anti-diabetic drugs before cerebral infarction(requiring thrombolysis or endovascular recanalization) Combination therpay is acceptable.","interventionNames":["Drug: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor"]},{"label":"except DPP4i","description":"patients that did not use DPP-4 inhibitors as anti-diabetic drugs before cerebral infarction(requiring thrombolysis or endovascular recanalization)"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","description":"The definition of antidiabetic drug use is defined as a case in which an antidiabetic drug was prescribed for at least 2 months before stroke and the duration of treatment for stroke coincided with the prescribed duration of the drug.","armGroupLabels":["DPP4i"],"otherNames":["A10BH07","EVOGLIPTIN","Suganon Tab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"1-year survival rate","description":"The survival rates of the DPP-4 inhibitor group and the non-use group are compared 1 year after the onset of severe stroke.","timeFrame":"Check the data one year after the onset of stroke."},{"measure":"90-day survival rate","description":"The survival rates of the DPP-4 inhibitor group and the non-use group are compared 90-day after the onset of severe stroke.","timeFrame":"Check the data 90-day after the onset of stroke."},{"measure":"re-hospitalization","description":"The re-hospitalization rates of the DPP-4 inhibitor group and the non-use group are compared after the onset of severe stroke.","timeFrame":"1 year after discharge the stroke treatment."},{"measure":"frequency of cerebral hemorrhage","description":"The frequency of cerebral hemorrhage rates of the DPP-4 inhibitor group and the non-use group are compared after the onset of severe stroke.","timeFrame":"Hospitalization period and 1 year after discharge the stroke treatment."},{"measure":"Rate of Intensive care unit treatment","description":"The Intensive care unit treatment rate of the DPP-4 inhibitor group and the non-use group are compared.","timeFrame":"Hospitalization period is expected to be up to three months.
