Of all strokes, 85% are ischemic strokes caused by a thrombus or an embolus. The additional 15% are caused by hemorrhage. Currently the only approved treatments for ischemic strokes are thrombolysis given within 4.5 hours and thrombectomy performed within 6 hours of symptom onset - in some cases up to 24 hours. The majority of stroke patients are not however eligible for acute reperfusion therapy, mainly due to time constrains and late presentation. Novel neuroprotective strategies available for all stroke patients are thus urgently needed.\n\nRemote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is a simple intervention in which transient ischemia is induced in an extremity by repetitive inflation-deflation of a blood pressure cuff. It remains uncertain exactly how the protective effect of RIC is transmitted and communicated between the extremity and the brain. Both humoral, immunological and neuronal pathways seem to be involved. Treatment with RIC and has proven to be a safe, feasible and low-cost treatment in clinical settings.\n\nBiomarkers of the RIC treatment is a new area of stroke research and are important to establish in order to assess and predict responders of the conditioning treatment. Rheo-erythrocrine dysfunction of the Red Blood Cell (RBC) is a novel biomarker in both ischemic strokes in general and on the effect of RIC. Red Blood Cells with a diameter of 6-8 μm must be highly deformable in order to deliver oxygen to brain tissue by travelling through micro vessels with a diameter of just 2-3 μm. RBC's can carry nitric oxide as NO2-/s-nitrosylated proteins. These proteins improve RBC deformability and induce hypoxic vasodilation thereby improving passage through the microvasculature. RBC's also express Erythrocyte Nitric Oxide Synthase 3, which regulate the rheo-erythrocrine function. Erythrocyte Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 is activated by shear stress and provide an extra source of NO for hypoxic vasodilation. Preliminary data have shown that experimental stroke on mice seems to cause a rheo-erythrocrine dysfunction of the RBC's leading to a loss of deformability. The RBC's become rigid, which can lead to occlusion of micro vessels in the brain and further ischemic damage. Loss of deformability can be measured as a reduced Elongation Index (EI) by ektacytometry and may be attenuated by RIC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Ischemic Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Central Nervous System Diseases"],"keywords":["Remote Ischemic Conditioning","Neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot, Single-center, Randomized, Patient-assessor blinded, Sham-controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Remote Ischemic Conditioning","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is applied during the in-hospital phase using an automated RIC device.\n\nTreatment characteristics: Five cycles (50 minutes), each consisting of five minutes of cuff inflation followed by five minutes of cuff deflation.
