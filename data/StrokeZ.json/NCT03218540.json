Both groups will be managed intraoperatively in the same way, except fluid management protocol. SVV group will be managed according to stroke volume variation (SVV) protocol, i.e., control SVV 10-13% and give fluid when SVV \\> 13%. CVP group will be managed using central venous pressure (CVP) protocol, i.e., control CVP 8-12 mmHg and give fluid when CVP \\< 8 mmHg.\n\nOutcome analyses: Postoperative serum lactate and creatinine of both groups will be compared using unpaired Student-t test.
