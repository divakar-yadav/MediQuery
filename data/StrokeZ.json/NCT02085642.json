There are approximately 50,000 new cases every year. Stroke victims often experience decreased mobility and significant disability as a result of impaired motor control and velocity-dependent muscle hypertonus (spasticity) in the lower extremity. Over the past 25 years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of acupuncture for the management of stroke-related neurological deficits.\n\nResearch questions: Is acupuncture more effective than sham treatment in reducing lower extremity spasticity, and improving gait speed in the chronic phase of stroke recovery?\n\nMethodology\n\nRecruitment: Forty patients will be recruited from the out patient rehabilitation program of a university affiliated teaching hospital.\n\nGroup Assignment and Blinding:\n\nThe study design is a randomized double blind format. Once identified, interested patients will be screened for eligibility by an intake secretary and randomly assigned to sham (n=20) or acupuncture treatment (n=20) groups using a computer random-number-generation system. Sealed envelopes containing the group assignment will be delivered to acupuncture-trained therapists delivering sham or true acupuncture treatment. Treating therapists' interactions will be standardized to minimize therapist/participant interaction bias Treating therapists will remain blinded to outcome assessment results. Patients will be blinded to the receipt of true acupuncture or sham needles. Outcome measurements will be done by a single assessor who is blinded to the group assignment.\n\nIntervention: Subjects will attend 4 acupuncture treatments sessions within a 3 week period. Needles will be applied to the following acupuncture points: Jiao's foot motor sensory scalp points (2 in total) and 2 additional standardized acupuncture points in the lower legs bilaterally based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approach. Treatment needles are pre-sterilized single disposable type, 0.20 mm size and 40 mm in length. The locations of the acupuncture point will be cleaned with alcohol (99%) swab. Needles will be left in place for 20 minutes. In the true acupuncture group, needles will be inserted to a depth at which participants report a tingling sensation (as described De-qi in TCM approach). Subjects randomized to the control group will be treated with retractable needles to avoid transcutaneous insertion at the same acupuncture points.\n\nOutcome Measures: The following outcome measures will be assessed by a blinded assessor. Primary outcome measures:2-minute walk test. Secondary outcome measures: ankle range of motion and self report soft tissue tightness. The outcome measures time frame is set at from baseline to the completion of the intervention period at 3 weeks.\n\nAnalysis: Descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation and frequencies will be used to describe the study participants, as appropriate. Paired t-test will be used for the parametric variables, number of steps per minute, distance on a 2-minute walk test and dorsi-flexion range of motion. Significance is set at p smaller than 0.05. All statistical analysis will be two sided and performed with SPSS (V21)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acupuncture","Gait","Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acupuncture","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"True acupuncture","interventionNames":["Other: Acupuncture"]},{"label":"Sham needle","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Retractable acupuncture needles will be used.
