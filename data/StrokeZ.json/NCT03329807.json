It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning. It is applied within clinical and in research contexts to determine the disease severity, describe motor recovery, and plan and assess interventions. In the present study, the 33-item of the UL section was employed. The items are rated on 3-point ordinal scale, as follows: 0= unable to perform; 1= partial ability to perform; and 2= near normal ability to perform. The UL subscale evaluates motor function recovery in six domains: flexor and extensor synergies, non-synergic movements, wrist and hand movements, and coordination and speed","timeFrame":"baseline; post-intervention.

This test consists of seven tasks: writing a sentence, turning cards and small common objects, feeding simulation, stacking chips, moving large light objects and large heavy objects.

Patient errors will also be recorded in numbers in case of misspelled words, for example; Changes in strategy to turn cards; Dropping small objects, beans, checkers or cans.","timeFrame":"baseline; post-intervention.

The test has two ordinal scales, each with six points for the graduation of activities: one scale relates to quantity and the other to the quality of MSA use. On the quantitative scale, scores range from zero (do not use the MSA) to five (use the MSA the same way you used before the stroke). On the qualitative scale, the score also ranges from zero (the MSA is not used at all for the activity) to five (your ability to use the MSA is as good as it was before the stroke). In this qualitative section the score can have intermediate scores as 0.5 or 1.5.","timeFrame":"baseline; post-intervention.
