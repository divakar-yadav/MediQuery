This government-funded catheter-based LAAO program was started in September 2015 and was completed in December 2017. Data collection was finished in December 2018. Five clinics agreed to participate in the study.\n\nPatients' baseline characteristics, procedure, and follow up data were collected according to established registry protocol. Patients were followed at 45 days, 3, 6 and 12 months after enrollment. At each follow-up visit, the data regarding clinical events and healthcare utilization was collected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","left atrial appendage","stroke prevention","occluder","Watchman device","Amplatzer Cardiac Plug"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Catheter-based left atrial appendage occlusion","description":"Catheter-based implantation of left atrial appendage occluder"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Procedure-related major adverse events (pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, device embolization, procedure/device-related death)","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"The composite of thromboembolic events, device thrombosis, hemorrhagic events, unexplained death","description":"Primary efficacy endpoint","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Procedure success rate","description":"successful left atrial appendage occluder implantation rate","timeFrame":"intraprocedural"},{"measure":"Peridevice leakage","description":"incidence rates of significant (≥5mm) leakage","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age ≥18 years nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,\n* CHA2DS2VASc ≥2,\n* high risk of hemorrhagic events,\n* non-compliance with pharmacological anticoagulant therapy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* significant mitral valve disease,\n* left ventricular ejection fraction \\<35%,\n* the tendency to systemic thrombosis,\n* severe co-morbidities","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients with a high risk of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Karapet Davtyan, PhD","affiliation":"National Research Center for Preventive Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
