Subjects will return to the clinical site on Day -1, be admitted to the unit, and eligibility will be reconfirmed. Eligible subjects will receive a single dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP, NSI-189 Phosphate or Placebo) on Day 1 and will be followed for safety and PK until discharge on Day 3. Subjects who are experiencing any significant AEs that are considered possibly related to study drug will be kept at the unit for an additional day (or longer) until the event resolves or it is considered medically safe for the subject to be discharged. Subjects will have a telephone Follow-up on Day 4 and return to the unit on Day 7 (± 1) for End-of-study. Participation of an individual subject may last up to 36 days from the time of Screening until the End-of-study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression"],"keywords":["Neurogenesis","hippocampal stem cells","depression","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dose 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]},{"label":"Dose 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]},{"label":"Dose 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]},{"label":"Dose 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]},{"label":"Dose 5","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]},{"label":"Dose 6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]},{"label":"Dose 7","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: NSI-189 Phosphate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"NSI-189 Phosphate","description":"Once daily oral administration","armGroupLabels":["Dose 1","Dose 2","Dose 3","Dose 4","Dose 5","Dose 6","Dose 7"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety of drug assessed by number and severity of adverse events in drug vs placebo groups","description":"Values for vital signs, standard physical examination, ECG, EEG and standard clinical laboratory tests (haematology and biochemistry), and for standard neurological exam and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale will be compared between NS189 and placebo.","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics of NS189 will be determined by plasma sample collection at various timepoints post-dosing, and measuring concentration of drug over time.","description":"Concentration of NS189 will be measured in plasma and standard PK values determined: AUC, Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, CL, Vz","timeFrame":"7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* A subject must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n  1.
