If the investigator's hypothesis would hold true and the investigators could show that cerebral hemodynamic changes after MT would increase the risk for post-interventional intracranial bleeding complications and poor outcome, the investigators would provide an easy-available, repeatable bedside screening and monitoring tool (TCD), which has the potential to guide individualized patient treatment in the early postinterventional period after MT.\n\nThe study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov after start of recruitment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Endovascular Stroke Treatment","Mechanical Thrombectomy","Reperfusion Injury","Intracranial Hemorrhage","Transcranial Duplex Sonography","Perfusion MRI","Cerebral Hyperperfusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational Study (no different study arms)","description":"Prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational study to investigate hemodynamic changes (by TCD and perfusion MRI) and blood biomarkers as predictors of reperfusion injury / intracranial hemorrhage after stroke thrombectomy of the anterior cerebral circulation","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Transcranial Duplex Sonography","Diagnostic Test: Brain MRI","Diagnostic Test: Blood biomarkers"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transcranial Duplex Sonography","description":"Immediately after mechanical thrombectomy, patients will be investigated with bedside neurosonography (including TCD) at the stroke unit or neurointensive care unit. Apart from routine assessment of brain-supplying vessels, experienced sonographers will especially focus on intracranial blood flow velocities and determine the MCA mean blood flow velocity index (recanalized divided by contralateral artery). To assess potential dynamic blood flow changes, these investigations will be repeated at 24-48 hours after thrombectomy and at day 7 when we expect a (more) stable stroke phase. During these neurosonographic assessments, other important and potentially influential (hemodynamic) parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate and use of vasoactive medications will be documented. Assessment of intracranial blood flow will be standardized to dedicated measuring points.","armGroupLabels":["Observational Study (no different study arms)"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Brain MRI","description":"The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) routinely performed on day 1 after thrombectomy to assess (1) the size and location of acute ischemic damage including (vasogenic) cerebral edema formation, (2) hemorrhagic transformation, (3) concomitant chronic ischemic and hemorrhagic brain changes, and (4) patency of intracranial vessels. Contrast-enhanced or arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI will be used to (5) measure cerebral perfusion status. Findings from perfusion MRI will be correlated with blood flow information from TCD.

Furthermore, the investigators will also measure neurofilament light chain protein as a marker for neuro-axonal damage that has been shown to indicate cerebral tissue destruction including vascular brain lesions with a very high sensitivity.\n\nFor analysis, peripheral blood will be taken by venipuncture on day one and at follow- up three months after MT.
