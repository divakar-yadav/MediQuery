This treatment option also opens up a new field of research, making possible the analysis of the clot responsible for intracranial occlusion. Indeed, in about 30% of the cases, the thrombectomy procedure makes it possible to retrieve either partially or completely the clot. Previous studies have analyzed the correlation between the composition of the thrombus and the etiology of stroke. Their discordant results do not yet make it possible to distinguish a particular profile of thrombus according to etiology. Other studies have shown a correlation between the proportion of red blood cells in a thrombus and the likelihood that it is visible in MRI or cerebral scanning. More recently, one study has demonstrated a correlation between the presence of lymphocytes in the thrombus and an atheromatous etiology.\n\nThe main limitations of these studies are the small number of patients included, the high variability of conservation protocols and the absence of plasma data, which does not allow for research on the correlation between clot composition and plasma biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Biological Specimen Banks","Biomarkers","Etiology","Prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Collection of thrombus that is responsible for stroke and blood sample","description":"A blood sample (venous or arterial) of 10 ml will be made, on ethylene Diamine Tetra-Acetic (EDTA) tube (5 ml) and citrate (5 ml).Thrombus resulting from thrombectomy will be collected at the end of the procedure.
