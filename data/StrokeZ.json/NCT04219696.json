Fall rates are particularly high soon after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. A new type of balance training, called reactive balance training (RBT), can reduce fall rates after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. In our previous study, RBT was implemented as part of routine care, and as a result, the dose of training was different for each participant; participants completed between one and twelve 30-minute sessions of RBT. Previous research in healthy older adults suggests that a single session of RBT is enough to lead to lasting changes in reactive balance control and reduce fall rates in daily life. It is not clear if the same is true for people with stroke, who have more severe impairments and might need a higher dose of training to achieve the same benefits.\n\nThe overall goal of this work is to determine the optimal dose of reactive balance training for people with stroke who are attending rehabilitation. This pilot study will determine the feasibility of a clinical trial to address this larger goal. People with sub-acute stroke will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1 session, 3 sessions, or 6 sessions of RBT. Each session will be 45 minutes long, and will occur as part of participants' routine out-patient rehabilitation. We will use our experiences with this pilot study to help design a larger study. Specifically, we will use this pilot study to answer the following questions: 1) what is the optimal sample size; 2) how long will it take to reach this sample size; 3) what outcome measures should be used; 4) how feasible is it to prescribe a specific dose of RBT to people with sub-acute stroke; and 5) what two intervention groups should be included in the larger trial?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome measures will be obtained by a research assistant who will be blinded to group allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1 session","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will complete one 45-minute session of reactive balance training.

Training strategies will be individualized to each participant, based on their balance impairments and rehabilitation goals. The RBT program includes multi-directional 'internal' and 'external' balance perturbations. Internal perturbations are achieved by asking the participant to complete tasks that challenge balance control, such that they lose balance when attempting to perform the task (e.g., kicking a soccer ball). External perturbation are delivered manually using a push or pull from the physiotherapist. As participants improve their reactive balance control, difficulty will be increased by shifting task requirements along a continuum from stable to mobile, and from predictable to unpredictable, and by increasing perturbation magnitude or imposing sensory or environmental challenges.","armGroupLabels":["1 session","3 sessions","6 sessions"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of falls in daily life","description":"Participants will be asked to report falls (\"an event that results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or other lower level\") in the 6 months post-training.

The platform will only move during these two trials, such that the perturbation will be unpredictable to participants. These perturbations differ from what will be used during training, and will measure transfer of training to novel and ecological loss of balance. Biomechanical stability when responding to the perturbation will be measured using an established method that considers the distance between the centre of mass and base of support; in general, a more posteriorly- (slip) or anteriorly-located (trip) centre of mass is considered less stable.","timeFrame":"Pre-intervention (at admission), post-intervention (before discharge, approximately 4 weeks), and 6 months post-intervention"},{"measure":"Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities","description":"Construct: physical activity in daily life.
