The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Dose the RIPC treatment combined with IV thrombolysis can improve the long-term functional outcome in AIS patients?\n* Dose the RIPC treatment combined with IV thrombolysis can improve the incidence rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, recurrent stroke/TIA, new-onset clinical AF on this long-term follow-up? A single rater (A.E.P.) trained by an experienced stroke physician (S.T.E.) contacted patients, relatives, and family physicians to gather all available medical information on the following issues: 1) survival status, 2) date of death in those who died (based on information of the treating physicians), 3) mRS score at the time of the interview, 4) recurrent stroke/TIA, 5) new onset atrial fibrillation, 6) other cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arteriopathy.\n\nResearchers will compare RIPC group and control group to see if the RIPC treatment have a long-term effect in AIS patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIPC group","description":"Patients underwent RIPC treatment after IV thrombolysis in the index stroke.","interventionNames":["Other: functional and medical information"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"The control group underwent no inflations or deflations in the index stroke.","interventionNames":["Other: functional and medical information"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"functional and medical information","description":"1) functional outcomes(mRS scoring), 2)survival status, 3) date of death in those who died (based on information of the treating physicians), 3) mRS score at the time of the interview, 4) recurrent stroke/TIA, 5) new onset atrial fibrillation, 6) other cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arteriopathy.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","RIPC group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the proportion of excellent functional outcome, %","description":"An excellent functional outcome define as mRS= 0 and 1.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 5 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the proportion of favorable outcome (mRS scores 0-2), %","description":"A favorable functional outcome define as mRS= 0-2.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 5 year"},{"measure":"incidence rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, %","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months"},{"measure":"recurrent stroke/TIA","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of first documented recurrent stroke/TIA or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients who completed the previous interventional rater-blinded controlled study were invited for the follow-up session.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Between August 2017 and June 2018, a total of 68 AIS patients who underwent IVT treatment were randomized into either the RIPC treatment group or the control group.
