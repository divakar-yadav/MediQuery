There are very few evidence-based, easy-to-deliver follow-up programs to train Veterans and caregivers across multiple domains post injury. The \"Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths for Veterans (ANSWERS-VA)\" intervention aims to provide the Veteran and caregiver dyad with a set of practical skills that each can use in coping with and managing symptoms of a brain injury, applying a strength-based approach.\n\nObjectives: The objectives of this study are to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate (a) the efficacy of the ANSWERS-VA dyadic intervention with Veterans who have sustained a stroke and/or TBI and their informal caregivers, and (b) estimate effect sizes for the ANSWERS-VA intervention. The ANSWERS-VA intervention will be compared with an educational intervention that will serve as an attention control group.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To tailor the implementation of the ANSWERS-VA intervention to dyads of Veterans post stroke and/or TBI and their informal caregivers (n=10) and modify the implementation processes for the RCT.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To test the short-term (immediately post-intervention) and long-term, sustained (12 and 24 weeks, and at 1 year) efficacy of the ANSWERS-VA intervention for improving: (a) the primary outcomes of the caregivers' quality of life and unhealthy days, and (b) the caregiver mediators of task difficulty, threat appraisal, self-efficacy for caregiving, and optimism.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To evaluate program delivery costs for the ANSWERS-VA intervention and the educational attention control procedures, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the ANSWERS-VA intervention in terms of noncaregiving hours and unhealthy days in caregivers of Veterans post stroke and/or TBI.\n\nExploratory Aim 1: To estimate the effect sizes for the ANSWERS-VA intervention for the caregiver and Veteran on the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms, social participation, and quality of the dyadic relationship.\n\nMethods: The investigators propose to conduct a RCT to evaluate the ANSWERS-VA intervention among Veterans with stroke or TBI and their caregivers (dyads). Veterans with stroke (N = 222) or TBI (N = 108) and their informal caregivers, who have received care at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston or the Richard L. Roudebush VAMC in Indianapolis, will be randomized to the ANSWERS-VA intervention or to an attention control group. Both the intervention and control procedures involve 8 telephone sessions delivered over 8 weeks, with a booster session at 12 weeks. Data collections will occur at baseline, 8 weeks (short-term intervention effect), 12 weeks (after booster), 24 weeks, and 1 year after baseline (long-term sustainability of intervention effect). Linear mixed models will be applied to the repeated-measures data to test efficacy of the program in stroke caregivers and to estimate effect sizes in TBI caregivers. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be employed to address the comparative costs and outcomes for the ANSWERS-VA intervention and attention control groups.\n\nStatus: Essential modifications for this project were requested and approved via VA Central Office. Institutional Review Board approval has been obtained for these modifications in Indianapolis and in Houston. Graduate students from multiple disciplines have been hired and have received two days of onsite training specific to the ANSWERS-VA intervention and control procedures, screening, recruitment, and data collection processes. The REDCap database has been updated for the project modifications and has been further tested. The investigators are currently working with frontline providers at both sites to recruit potential participants for this RCT. Enrollment of first subject dyads began November, 2014. At this time, the investigators have completed recruitment of new dyads. We continue to complete outcomes assessments on some dyads. We plan to submit an abstract to the International Stroke Conference in January 2019."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["stroke","Injury, Brain, Traumatic","Family Caregivers","TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury)","Informal Caregivers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":143,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ANSWERS-VA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"8 week telephone intervention with nurse case manager using \"Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths\" (ANSWERS)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ANSWERS - Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths"]},{"label":"Control","type":"OTHER","description":"8 week telephone usual care with education with nurse case manager","interventionNames":["Other: Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"ANSWERS - Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths","description":"Randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of the telephone intervention \"Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths\"in informal caregivers of Veterans with stroke and TBI.","armGroupLabels":["ANSWERS-VA"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control","description":"8 week telephone usual care with education with nurse case manager","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Caregiver's Depressive Symptoms by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) Scale","description":"Depression scores are measured with the PHQ9 scale.
