American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASAs) physical status Ⅰ-Ⅱ who will be candidate for posterior decompression of vertebral canal,discectomy and internal fixation by pediclescrew(one centrum).The investigators excluded patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,hepatic or renal dysfunction,and patients receiving drugs that interfere with coagulation before surgery.\n\nPatients randomly divided into study group(group H,n=120)and control group (group C,n=40).The study group according to CI(Cardiac Index) levels of intraoperative hypotension period(mean of CI at T2,T3,T4) were divided into three groups: 1st group: CI: 1.5-2.0 L /(min•m2), 2nd group: CI: 2.0-3.0 L /(min•m2), 3rd group: CI: 3.0-4.0 L /(min•m2),and which CI \\< 1.5 or CI \\> 4.0 was eliminated the experimental
