The Magnetic Levator Prosthesis (MLP), is an external device that makes use of a newer class of permanent magnets (made of alloys of neodymium (Nd), iron (Fe) and boron (B)) to restore eyelid movement. The Kinesiotape Frontalis Sling (KTFS), involves the use of tape to help facilitate levator muscle contraction to open the eyelid. Video recordings of spontaneous and volitional blinks will be used to evaluate the effects of each device on eyelid reanimation.\n\nThe clinical trial will employ a crossover design in which participants will try each device at home in counterbalanced order with a washout period between. In each period of the crossover, participants will receive training (during study visits at Massachusetts Eye and Ear) in how to apply the device and will then try the device at home for one week with daily follow up by video calls. At the end of the one-week period of home use there will be a study visit at Massachusetts Eye and Ear when the device will be returned and additional video recordings of eye blinks will be made.\n\nAt the end of the crossover period, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire comparing the two devices and to select their preferred device. If considered clinically appropriate, participants may be invited to continue using the preferred device for an additional two months with weekly follow ups to provide information about longer-term use of the intervention. Participants who are still using one of the devices at the end of the two months will be returned to clinical care and receive a study follow up (telephone call) after another 6 and 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Blepharoptosis","Ptosis, Eyelid","Myasthenia Gravis","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MLP first, KTFS second","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm will receive the MLP in the first period of the crossover and the KTFS in the second period.","interventionNames":["Device: Magnetic Levator Prosthesis (MLP)","Device: Kinesiotape Frontalis Sling (KTFS)"]},{"label":"KTFS first, MLP second","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm will receive the KTFS in the first period of the crossover and the MLP in the second period.","interventionNames":["Device: Magnetic Levator Prosthesis (MLP)","Device: Kinesiotape Frontalis Sling (KTFS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magnetic Levator Prosthesis (MLP)","description":"Neodymium magnet embedded in a glasses frame and a polymer embedded (PDMS) micro-magnet array fitted externally to the upper lid with IV 3000 securement film.
