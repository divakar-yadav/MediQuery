The intervention group will receive an interactive board game in a group (2\\~6 individuals), while the control group was assigned to read the health education flier and watching the stroke prevention video. The follow-up period was set to be four weeks after the intervention, both control group, and intervention group.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a major health problem and a known cause of death and disability. Approximately 13 million people suffered from stroke worldwide annually and it ranks fourth among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan. In a recent survey of Taiwanese citizens on the World Stroke Day event (New Taipei City) in 2012, the public's stroke literacy was low, only 5.71% of them can reach \"good stroke literacy\". Generally, stroke education was mostly implemented in a one-way lecture way. Therefore, instead of one-way style health education, the investigators assume that interactive board games can increase stroke knowledge, stroke literacy, and self-reported stroke health literacy of community-dwelling seniors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":115,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive interactive board game health education.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Interactive board game health education"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive conventional health education.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional health education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Interactive board game health education","description":"The interactive board game includes risk factors, symptoms, and acute management of stroke.
