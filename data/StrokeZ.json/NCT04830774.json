COVID-19 is mainly characterized by respiratory symptoms; however, patients can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular complications. Among them, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias have been described in patients at different stages of disease severity. According to a recent study on 9564 COVID-19 patients, 17.6% developed AF during hospitalization, 65.7% of whom without a past arrhythmic history.\n\nSeveral factors (e.g., hypoxia, systemic inflammatory response, myocardial injury) may interact with a preexisting substrate and act as a trigger for AF initiation. Nonetheless, the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related new-onset AF remains elusive. It is unknown whether the disease merely acts as a transient arrhythmia initiator or promotes long-term atrial electrophysiological and structural changes which may facilitate AF recurrence and progression.\n\nTherefore, the investigators designed a multicenter, prospective registry to assess the natural history of AF via continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (ILR, PMK, ICD) in patients with a first AF episode during COVID-19 hospitalization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COVID-19","Atrial Fibrillation New Onset"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","COVID-19","natural
