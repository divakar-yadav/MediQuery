Blood flow velocity (BFV) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) will be measured during normocapnic, hypocapnic, and hypercapnic states. Subjects will be asked to wear nose clips and breathe only through a mouthpiece. Baseline (3 minutes) recordings will be taken during spontaneous breathing of room air and then subjects underwent 1 minute of maximal voluntary hyperventilation with a duty cycle of 1 second. The MCA-BFV will be recorded during the last 20 seconds of hyperventilation. After that, subjects will be asked to breathe air containing a mixture of 5 % CO2 and 21 % O2 balanced with nitrogen spontaneously for 3 minutes and the MCA-BFV will be recorded during the last minute of hypercapnia.","timeFrame":"baseline, Post-test (immediately: 0 min after finish massage intervention, 60 min, 120 min, 24 Hrs."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in stress indicators","description":"- Serum cortisol will be measured with cortisol EIA kit (Enzo Life Science, Switzerland).","timeFrame":"Baseline, Post-test (immediately: 0 min after finish massage intervention)"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in stress indicators","description":"- Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured using the Heart rate monitoring (RS800CX, Polar Electro, Oy, Finland)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Post-test (immediately: 0 min after finish massage intervention, 60 min, 120 min, 24 Hrs."},{"measure":"Change from baseline in Peripheral arterial stiffness","description":"- Pulse wave velocity measurement will be assessed with MD6 bidirectional transcutaneous Doppler probe (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA).
