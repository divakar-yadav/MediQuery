Presence of movement pattern deviations such as stiff-legged gait, foot drop, hip hiking and hip circumduction\n* Modified Rankin Scale score of 1 - 3, regardless of the cause(s) of the disability\n* Sufficient ambulatory ability to independently complete the 2MinWT and 10MWT\n* ≥ 6 months from occurrence of most recent stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Woman who is not surgically sterile or is less than 2 years postmenopausal, and does not agree to use a highly effective birth control method during the study and up to 3 months after the last dose of investigational product.\n* Woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant\n* History of seizures, except simple febrile seizures\n* Moderate or severe renal impairment as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance of
