Respondent's answers are translated into a preference-based score, yielding an index score based on a scale from 0.000 (death) to 1.000 (perfect health).

The 5 domains assessed include: motor function (upper limb maximum score = 66; lower limb maximum score = 34), sensory function (maximum score = 24), balance (maximum score = 14), joint range of motion (maximum score = 44), joint pain (maximum score = 44), for an overall maximum score of 226 points.","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in motor functions","description":"Assessed with the Nine hole pegboard test (NHPT), to measure finger dexterity.
