However, the extent to which patients profited from AV-synchronous stimulation varied substantially.\n\nAim of the study Aim of this study is to systematically analyze the impact of diastolic function and other echo parameters on the difference of stroke volumes/cardiac output between AV-synchronous and AV-dyssynchronous pacing modes.\n\nMethods Patients fulfilling the entry criteria will be enrolled (two-chamber pacemaker of any vendor eligible) in this monocentric, prospective, interventional study. Baseline data will be collected with a standardized questionnaire. During an echo examination, parameters of diastolic, systolic and atrial function will be assessed. Then, the stroke volume/cardiac output will be measured twice in each patient, once with AV-synchronous and once with AV-dyssynchronous pacing. Therefore, each patient will represent their own control. It will be randomized (coin tossing) which stimulation mode is first and which is second (sonographer and patient will be blinded). Descriptive statistics will be applied and regression models will be fitted to explore the data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diastolic Function","Cardiac Output","Pacemaker Stimulation Mode","Stroke Volume","AV Block"],"keywords":["Diastolic function","Cardiac output","Pacemaker stimulation mode","Stroke volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Each patient will represent their own control, as both pacing modes (asynchronous and synchronous) are applied in each patient.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"It is decided by coin tossing which pacing mode is programmed first (randomization).
