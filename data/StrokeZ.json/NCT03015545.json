Whole-body vibration (WBV) is known to have modulatory effects of muscle reflex activity and blood flow in other populations and thus have potential applications in management of spastic hypertonia post-stroke. However, the potential effects of WBV on leg muscle stiffness in stroke rehabilitation remains unknown. Scientific evidence is warranted to fill the knowledge gap.\n\nPurpose This study aims to investigate the acute effect of WBV on leg muscle H-reflex, stiffness and blood perfusion in people with chronic stroke.\n\nMethods Individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited from community self-help groups and existing patient database. Relevant information (e.g. demographic information, medical history) will be obtained from medical records and subject interviews. Each subject will have to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosis of chronic stroke, (2) community-dwelling, (3) able to follow simple verbal instructions. Exclusion criteria are: (1) other diagnoses of neurological conditions, (2) significant musculoskeletal conditions (e.g. amputations), (3) metal implants in the lower extremity or spine, (4) recent fracture in the lower extremity, (5) diagnosis of osteoporosis, (6) vestibular disorders, (7) peripheral vascular disease, and (11) other serious illnesses or contraindications to exercise.\n\nThis is a single-blinded randomized within-patient cross-over study. Each participant was evaluated for the soleus H-reflex, stiffness and blood perfusion of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) using ultrasound on both sides before and after either a 5-minute WBV intervention (30 Hertz, 1.5mm, knee flexed 60 degrees) or a no-WBV condition (5 minutes). The measurements were performed at baseline and every 1-min post-intervention up to 5 minutes. The outcomes generated included the soleus H/M ratio, shear modulus and vascular index (VI) of the MG muscle."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Muscle Stiffness","Ultrasound elastography","H-reflex","Whole body vibration","blood perfusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will stand with knee flexion 60 degrees on the same vibration platform for 60 seconds for 5 times with 60-seconds rest interval, but no vibration will be given.","interventionNames":["Device: paretic leg-control","Device: non-paretic leg-control"]},{"label":"High intensity whole body vibration","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will stand with knee flexion 60 degrees on the same vibration platform for 60 seconds for 5 times with 60-seconds rest interval.
