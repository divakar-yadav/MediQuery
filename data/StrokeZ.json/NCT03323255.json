It will also assess the effects on the resting motor threshold of both hemispheres and on parietopremotor connectivity.\n\nTo achieve theses aims, the real cTBS stimulation will be randomly counterbalanced with a SHAM stimulation (in a second session) in a crossover design. Assessments will be performed before and after each stimulation session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Brain
