Blood glucose will be recorded every minute using a continuous blood glucose monitor. The primary end points will be the difference between the mean blood glucose levels and the glucose variability between the control and intervention groups for the time period that the patient is in the ICU and receiving tube feeds and for up to a maximum of 14 days.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo determine the effects of the diabetes specific versus standard tube feeds on the change in muscle thickness and volume measured by 2-dimensional ultrasound imaging during the patients ICU stay."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Intracranial Hemorrhage","Ischemic Strokes","Subdural Hematoma"],"keywords":["glycemic control","glycemic variability","mean blood glucose level"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Glycerna","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Diabetic specific formula.
