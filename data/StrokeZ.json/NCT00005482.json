Supplementation with folate, and to some extent vitamins B12 and B6, can reduce plasma homocyst(e)ine levels. There is also evidence from in vitro studies that the adverse atherogenic or thrombotic effects of Lp(a) may be greatly enhanced by homocyst(e)ine. The high prevalence of low levels of folate and vitamins B12 and B6 among the elderly in the United States has led to the hypothesis that a substantial portion of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among older persons could be prevented by increasing intake of these nutrients to reduce plasma levels of homocysteine. Little is known, however, regarding the relationship of homocysteine, folate, B vitamins, and Lp(a) to cardiovascular disease among the elderly, among whom CVD represents the leading cause of morbidity and mortality.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nIn this ancillary study to the prospective Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a case-cohort design was used to test hypotheses that the risk of myocardial infarction and/or stoke was associated with elevated plasma levels of homocysteine, and low plasma levels of folate, vitamins B12 and B6. Further, a determination was made whether elevated plasma levels of homocysteine and Lp(a) interacted to increase substantially the risk of myocardial infarction and/or stroke above that due to either factor alone. The sub-cohort was used to study the relationship between the factors under study and progression of sub-clinical atherosclerosis. For each case and sub-cohort member, an aliquot of fasting plasma drawn at baseline was analyzed for homocysteine, folate B12, and B6 concentrations. \\[Values of plasma Lp(a) were determined at baseline.\\] Results of these assays were combined with other CHS data to address the hypothesis that the risk of myocardial infarction and/or stroke was associated with elevated plasma levels of homocysteine, and low plasma levels of folate, vitamins B12 and B6."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Cerebrovascular Accident","Coronary Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Heart Diseases","Hyperhomocysteinemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL"},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"No eligibility criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000009203","term":"Myocardial Infarction"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000020138","term":"Hyperhomocysteinemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000000592","term":"Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors"},{"id":"D000008661","term":"Metabolism, Inborn Errors"},{"id":"D000030342","term":"Genetic Diseases, Inborn"},{"id":"D000008286","term":"Malabsorption Syndromes"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000014804","term":"Vitamin B Deficiency"},{"id":"D000001361","term":"Avitaminosis"},{"id":"D000003677","term":"Deficiency Diseases"},{"id":"D000044342","term":"Malnutrition"},{"id":"D000009748","term":"Nutrition Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","asFound":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","asFound":"Myocardial Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","asFound":"Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21664","name":"Hyperhomocysteinemia","asFound":"Hyperhomocysteinemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3622","name":"Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11331","name":"Metabolism, Inborn Errors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M23376","name":"Genetic Diseases, Inborn","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10968","name":"Malabsorption Syndromes","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4350","name":"Avitaminosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6569","name":"Deficiency Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M24996","name":"Malnutrition","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12374","name":"Nutrition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T3036","name":"Inborn Amino Acid Metabolism Disorder","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M17248","name":"Vitamins","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Micro","name":"Micronutrients"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
