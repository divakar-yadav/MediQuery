Generally, there are many walking training theories and methods for patients with chronic stroke and treadmill walking training is applied in recent years. Previous studies showed that patients with stroke improve the walking abilities and speed after the walking treadmill training. However, most studies have demonstrated that forward walking treadmill training improved balance and walking ability in patients with stroke, but fewer studies have investigated the effects on backward walking treadmill training. However, no studies to date have investigated the effects of backward walking treadmill training for patients with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Chronic Stroke","cardiopulmonary","Berg Balance Scale (BBS)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"backward walking treadmill training","type":"OTHER","description":"The intervention group not only received four weeks of conventional physical therapy but also accepted additional four weeks of backward walking treadmill training at the same time","interventionNames":["Other: backward walking treadmill training","Other: conventional physical therapy"]},{"label":"conventional physical therapy","type":"OTHER","description":"The conventional physical therapy training focused on strengthening, postural control, functional mobility and forward gait training program but excluded backward walking training","interventionNames":["Other: conventional physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"backward walking treadmill training","description":"subjects accepted 30 minutes backward walking treadmill training. a week for four weeks.","armGroupLabels":["backward walking treadmill training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional physical therapy","description":"subjects accepted 30 minutes traditional physical therapy three times a week for four weeks","armGroupLabels":["backward walking treadmill training","conventional physical therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS)","timeFrame":"Baseline, week 4."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The change of pulmonary function test (PFT): forced vital capacity (FVC) and Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"Baseline, week 4."}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed 10-Meter Walk Test (10 MWT)","timeFrame":"10 minutes"},{"measure":"6-minute walk test (6 MWT)","timeFrame":"6-minute"},{"measure":"Up and Go test (TUG)","timeFrame":"Baseline, week 4."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* This experiment recruited subjects with chronic stroke more than six months, whose level of Brunnstrom stage was beyond IV and who were able to walk more than eleven meters with or without assistive devices\n\nExclusion Criteria:","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"60 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Lan Y Guo, Ph.D","affiliation":"Department of Sports Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kaohsiung Medical University","city":"Kaohsiung","zip":"807","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":22.61626,"lon":120.31333}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"type":"RESULT","citation":"Mathers CD, Loncar D.
