In conjunction with the PREP programme, and based on the GRASP programme, the aim is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an upper limb intervention support for survivors. Integration of an evidence based upper limb programme to an established physical activity programme will be a feasible method to support long term upper limb rehabilitation to community dwelling stroke survivors.","detailedDescription":"The main objectives for overall study is to assess acceptability of the demand of the trial as well as the PREP Plus intervention placed on survivors and their carers. Within this mixed methods study, the investigators aim to recruit participants in a total of three waves. Each site will deliver 6 weeks of the intervention / control with a new set of participants before post intervention qualitative measures (focus groups and 1:1 interviews) are used to inform the design of the next wave. With having the trial in three waves, their objective is to optimise the design of upper limb rehab and the delivery by therapists with preparing them with adequate training and resources aimed toward upper limb rehab in survivors of stroke.\n\nParticipant recruitment will integrate into the current PREP programme design.\n\nAll participants will complete one hour of circuit-based exercises followed by one hour of education. The exercise stations will focus on lower body/cardiovascular fitness station and upper limb strength exercises. Each week the amount of time spent at each station will be increased by 30 seconds resulting in a final 3 minutes at each station. Those in the intervention group, will have an additional five exercises that focus on upper limb stretching, arm stretching, hand stretching, coordination, and hand skills."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper limb","Physical activity","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Each site will deliver 6 weeks of the intervention / control with a new set of participants before post intervention qualitative measures are used to inform the design of the next wave.","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":74,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PREP group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group","interventionNames":["Other: PREP"]},{"label":"PREP Plus group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention group","interventionNames":["Other: PREP Plus"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"PREP Plus","description":"Group based exercise in addition to PREP exercises","armGroupLabels":["PREP Plus group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"PREP","description":"Group based exercise","armGroupLabels":["PREP group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meter walk test: Measuring change in walking speed from baseline to 6 weeks","description":"functional performance measure","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Edinburgh Warwick Questionnaire: Measuring change in mental wellbeing from baseline to 6 weeks","description":"Mental wellbeing and quality of life measure","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed Get up and Go [TUG] test: Measuring change in lower limb function from baseline to 6 weeks","description":"lower limb functional performance test","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Rating of Everyday Arm-use in the Community and Home (REACH) Scale: Measuring change in upper limb use from baseline to 6 weeks","description":"upper limb use","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Focus group with participants","description":"Overall experience: Stroke survivor experience","timeFrame":"end of 6 weeks"},{"measure":"1:1 interviews with intervention therapist","description":"Determine optimum design considering acceptability, practicality and resources.
