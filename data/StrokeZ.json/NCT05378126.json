Brain infarctions complicate approximately 20-40% of endocarditis.\n\nBrain MRI can detect the presence of recent ischemic lesions and asymptomatic microbleeds. Preoperative brain imaging is part of the recommended assessment in the management of IEs, but the type of imaging and sequences are not codified and the impact of cerebral and vascular imaging findings on the therapeutic decision remains uncertain.\n\nThe level of evidence of the recommendations remains low, especially for complicated IEs of stroke. There is very little neurological clinical data on patients with IEs. Similarly, neurologists do not systematically participate in multidisciplinary meetings during the management of an IE. It therefore seems interesting to carry out a neurological cohort of this population and to evaluate what would be the contribution of vascular neurologists in the management of infectious endocarditis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endocarditis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Neurological assessment","Medical care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurological cohort","type":"OTHER","description":"All patients included in the study wil have a neurological examination","interventionNames":["Other: Neurological assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neurological assessment","description":"No specific procedure is planned for the study other than the neurological examination by a neurologist of all patients.
