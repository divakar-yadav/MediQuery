Specifically, the study will transplant autologous ADSCs into brain surrounding ischemic infarct in adult (65-80 years old) subjects who have chronic non-hemorrhagic stroke (\\>6 months).","detailedDescription":"This open-label clinical trial will compare outcomes of subjects with chronic stroke. Six subjects will be to treatment (n=3) groups. The treatment group will receive brain transplants of autologous ADSCs. Treatment group will receive rehabilitation after the transplantation. Subjects will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eight standardized stroke indices: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), ( Barthel Index )、 ( Berg balance scale )、 (Fugl - Meyer test )、(Action research arm test )、 (Purdue pegboard )、 ( grip strength measurement ) 、(somatosensory evoked potential, SSEP) at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GXNPC1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Three subjects will be to treatment (n=3) groups.
