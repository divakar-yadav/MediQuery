Participants will be divided into two equal groups. One group will receive routine physical therapy while other group will receive postural and kinesthetic awareness in addition to routine physical therapy.","detailedDescription":"To determine effects of Postural and kinesthetic awareness on plantar pressure and static standing balance in chronic stroke patients. The study was conducted at the University of Lahore Teaching Hospital in the Department of Pediatric Physical Therapy \\& Neuro Rehabilitation Center. Total 62 stroke patients with visual spatial neglect were enrolled in this study, patients were equally assigned into control and experimental group. Control group received routine physical therapy while experimental group received routine physical therapy and postural and kinesthetic awareness program. Static component of berg balance scale and PoData Stabiliometeric plate was used for measurement of balance and plantar pressure respectively"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","static balance","plantar pressure","postural and kinestetic awareness","PoData Stabiliometeric plate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Routine Physical Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"routine physical therapy including range of motion exercises (Active assisted), stretching exercises, strengthening and positioning.
