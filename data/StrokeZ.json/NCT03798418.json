The outcomes will be analyzed regarding muscle strength, quality, and volume, etc., balance and gait, bone density, body composition, fall and quality of life after the intervention.","detailedDescription":"The main common chronic diseases in the elderly such as stroke, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease and cancer, have been regarded as the fall high-risk patients. These patients are considered to be at risk for sarcopenia due to decreased exercise, nutritional status, and other reasons. Sarcopenia can be diagnosed and intervened effectively to delay the vicious cycle of health. Past studies have pointed out that in addition to drug intervention, treatment for sarcopenia must be accompanied by appropriate exercise and nutritional intervention (such as protein supplements, vitamin D) in order to achieve the best prevention and treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Osteoporosis","Chronic Kidney Diseases","Cancer"],"keywords":["Sarcopenia","stroke","osteoporosis","chronic kidney disease","cancer","balance and gait","fall"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":186,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"exercise group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"elastic band strengthening exercise","interventionNames":["Behavioral: elastic band strengthening exercise"]},{"label":"exercise combine diet counseling group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"elastic band strengthening exercise combined diet counseling.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: elastic band strengthening exercise","Dietary Supplement: diet counseling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"elastic band strengthening exercise","description":"2-3days per week(150min per week)","armGroupLabels":["exercise combine diet counseling group","exercise group"],"otherNames":["thera-band strengthening exercise"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"diet counseling","description":"each patients in this group will receive4-5times diet counseling","armGroupLabels":["exercise combine diet counseling group"],"otherNames":["nutrition counseling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of walking speed","description":"distance: 6m, patients can walk with foor orthosis and assistive devices","timeFrame":"baseline: before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of grip force","description":"Use a grip force meter (kg) to test both hands for test 3 times","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of postural sway displacement","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure the postural sway displacement (mm)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of postural sway velocity","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure the postural sway velocity (mm/s)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of postural sway area","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure the postural sway area (mm\\^2)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of step time","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: step time (ms)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of stance time","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: stance time (ms)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of swing time","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: swing time (ms)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of single support time","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: single support time (ms)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of double support time","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: double support time (ms)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of step length","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: step distance (mm)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of stance length","description":"Use computerized dynography to measure spatial gait parameter: stance distance (mm)","timeFrame":"before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change of muscle thickness","description":"Use ultrasound to assess muscles morphological parameter: thickness (mm).
