The following etiological workup is required in this setting: head CT or MRI, 12-lead ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, continuous cardiac monitoring for at least 24 hours after stroke, vascular imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, catheter angiography). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered not to be required.\n\nHowever, aortic arch atheroma as diagnosed by TEE in the setting of recent ischemic stroke is a major aortic source of embolism, as supported by numerous well conducted studies. The European Association of Echocardiography considers that TEE is the gold standard for the diagnosis and the characterization of aortic atheroma. It is also the method of choice for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis.\n\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the rate of patients with a therapeutic modification induced by TEE (mainly anticoagulation and surgery), in consecutive patients admitted with ESUS at our institution stroke unit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source","transesophageal echocardiography","cardiac source of embolism","ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":186,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"therapeutic modification after transesophageal echocardiography","description":"proportion of patients with a therapeutic modification (mainly anticoagulation and surgery)","timeFrame":"24 hours after TEE"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presenting with a new onset of ischemic stroke\n* Meeting the ESUS criteria (Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source)\n* Comprehensive transthoracic echo prior to the TEE\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* ESUS criteria not met\n* Contraindications to TEE\n* TEE failure\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding woman\n* Person under legal protection\n* No medical insurance coverage","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients followed for ichemic stroke meeting embolic source of unknown source criteria","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nadia Benyounes, MD","affiliation":"Fondation Ophtalmologique A. de Rothschild","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Fondation Ophtalmologique A de Rothschild","city":"Paris","zip":"75019","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000083262","term":"Embolic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7474","name":"Embolism","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2403","name":"Embolic Stroke","asFound":"Embolic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
