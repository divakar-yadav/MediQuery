The adverse clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, were followed from the date of admission for acute myocardial infarction or acute cerebral infarction until study end (December 31, 2016). All-cause mortality, including the date of death, was identified from the electronic hospitalization data, phone follow-up, and confirmed by the household registration (HUKOU) system, a record of registration required by law in China. Baseline characteristics, including major treatment of acute myocardial infarction or acute cerebral infarction, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria, were collected. Demographic data were determined from the electronic hospitalization data and electronic hospital discharge records. All comorbid conditions were identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), coding algorithms applied to electronic physician claims and electronic hospital discharge records. Life style (smoking), treatment regimen at discharge, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), were determined from the electronic hospitalization data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction","Cerebral Infarction","Chronic Kidney
