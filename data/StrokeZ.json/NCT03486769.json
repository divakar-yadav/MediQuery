Simultaneous dual site-dual channel stimulation was applied by using two sets of transcranial direct current stimulation devices. All subjects will go through three conditions of transcranial direct current stimulation with for 30 minutes. Three conditions are 1) Dual stimulation 1: i) anodal stimulation on ipsilesional primary motor cortex and cathodal stimulation on contralesional primary motor cortex, ii) anodal stimulation on ipsilesional premotor cortex and cathodal stimulation on contralesional supraorbital area. 2) Dual stimulation 2: i) anodal stimulation on ipsilesional primary motor cortex and cathodal stimulation on contralesional primary motor cortex, ii) anodal stimulation on ipsilesional anterior intraparietal sulcus and cathodal stimulation on contralesional supraorbital area. 3) Single stimulation: anodal stimulation on ipsilesional primary motor cortex and cathodal stimulation on contralesional primary motor cortex."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["transcranial direct current
