This initiative centers on the use of an Outreach Facilitation Model, in which skilled health professionals known as facilitators (Practice Change Consultants) serve as an expert resource to primary care practices in three areas: a) practice performance assessment, feedback, and consensus building towards goal setting and implementation; b) clinical, technical, organizational resources and practical advice; and c) encouragement to face and move through the challenges associated with implementing system change.","detailedDescription":"General practice visits can provide a unique opportunity to identify and treat individuals with or at risk for CVD. We plan to test implementation of system changes using nurse facilitation in the organization of primary care practices to enhance daily adoption by the practice staff of evidence-based guidelines and prevention strategies that can lead to better patient care.\n\nSpecifically, we will:\n\ni) Establish an Outreach Facilitation program in primary care practices throughout the Champlain District to improve the secondary prevention and management of cardiovascular disease in the primary care setting. The program will assist the practices (Champlain CVD Prevention Network) with implementation of evidence-based guidelines (Champlain Primary Care CVD Prevention Guidelines) by targeting the following risk factors:\n\n* Hypertension\n* Dyslipidemia\n* Diabetes\n* Chronic Kidney Disease\n* Smoking\n* Obesity\n* Physical Inactivity\n\nii) Rigorously evaluate this program's efficacy and cost effectiveness\n\nHypotheses\n\nImplementation of the outreach facilitation program for CVD prevention and management will improve: i) the processes of cardiovascular health related care delivery by primary care practitioners in the Champlain LHIN, and ii) the clinical outcomes for patients with established CVD and those at high cardiovascular risk. The improvements will be evident on the comparisons of the pre- to post-implementation performance within the participating practices, and on the between practice comparisons of performance in those randomized to begin the program earlier with those randomized to begin it later.\n\nDesign\n\nWe will use a \"stepped wedge\" design where the outreach facilitation program will be rolled-out sequentially to the trial participants, in geographic regions chosen by random order, over a number of equally spaced time intervals during the 5 year program implementation period.\n\nTo allow for the sequential roll-out of the program, the Champlain LHIN has been divided into 9 smaller geographic regions, referred to from now on as \"divisions\", using GIS mapping technology. The order in which these divisions begin the program has been randomized, but stratified by the west/central/and east location within the LHIN, so that each division per stratum will have the same probability of beginning the program at any specific time.\n\nThere will be 4 data collection points throughout the 5-year implementation period. In the analysis, the data points before program implementation (the baseline section of the wedge) will be compared to the data points after the program begun (the implementation section of the wedge) both within and between the divisions. The multiple baseline data obtained for those divisions randomized to begin the program later than others will allow for underlying temporal changes to be considered as a variable in data analysis in order to determine, for example, whether any secular changes had an impact on effectiveness of the program.\n\nImpact Evaluation\n\nTo measure the population-level impact of the program we will collaborate with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Specifically, we will evaluate the regional impact of the program on cardiovascular health by linking participating doctors with provincial administrative databases from ICES to determine the rates of CVD-related hospitalization and emergency department visits, mortality and morbidity, and drug prescription patterns for hypertension, lipid control, and other vascular protective agents.\n\nIn addition, we will measure the success of the program at the level of the primary care practice through a qualitative assessment of the following aspects of program implementation:\n\n* the impact of the intervention on physicians, associated staff and patients\n* the resources and activities required to implement the intervention and the extent to which it was implemented as intended\n* the factors which contributed to success or which introduce barriers to success\n\nSatisfaction with the program will be evaluated at the level of the physician, practice staff, and the facilitators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Dyslipidemia","Diabetes","Chronic Kidney Disease","Cardiovascular Disease","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attacks"],"keywords":["Primary care","Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease","Chronic Disease Management","Chronic Disease Prevention","Chronic Care Model","Outreach Facilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":194,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Outreach Facilitation implementing elements of the Chronic Care Model.
