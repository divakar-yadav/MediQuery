It was hypothesized that random speed change group will show less attention and balance demands for speed change in level walking.","detailedDescription":"This study includes chronic stroke patients who will be randomly assigned to blocked or random walking speed change group to receive 30 min per session, 3 sessions per week for 2 weeks' walking training on a treadmill. The outcome measures include gait characteristics under 3 tasks x 3 speed conditions x 2 attention conditions on an obstacle-free walk way. The three tasks are normal walking, narrow based walking and obstacle crossing. The three speed conditions are constant (preferred) speed, speeding up (preferred to maximum speed), and slowing down (maximum to preferred speed). The two attention conditions are none and serial subtraction of 3 during walking. Clinical sensorimotor function assessment, including hand grip strength, plantar sensitivity, stroke rehabilitation assessment of movement and Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor scale will be conducted for subject characterization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","gait","dual tasks","motor learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"training with random speed changes","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Walking training on treadmill with random speed changes, that is, random sequence of several different walking speeds","interventionNames":["Other: Treadmill walking training with random speed changes"]},{"label":"training with blocked speed changes","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Walking training on treadmill with blocked speed changes, that is a steady progression of faster walking speed.","interventionNames":["Other: Treadmill walking training with blocked speed changes"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Treadmill walking training with random speed changes","description":"Participants were asked to walk in different gait speed randomly on the treadmill (80%, 90%, 100%, 110% and 120% of preferred speed).
