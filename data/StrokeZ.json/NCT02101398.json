That is why we compare the effects of four different positionings of the electrodes (two anterior over Broca's area and its homologue and two posterior over Wernicke's area and its homologue) to a sham stimulation in order to observe if a more important effect of one or another positioning could be found."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["tDCS","Stroke","Aphasia","Naming"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"F7A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anodal electrode set on the left Broca's area and cathodal electrode set on its right homologue.
