HBOT produces greatly elevated arterial and tissue oxygen tensions, producing a wide variety of physiological effects at the cellular and sub cellular level. Some of these effects have been postulated to be beneficial in the context of ischemic stroke.\n\nMost of the recovery after stroke occurs in the first 30 to 90 days after the acute event. Recovery is largely based on recovery of brain that is injured, but viable. Physiological imaging studies (PET, EEG) have demonstrated that brain tissue may remain alive but not functional for months or years after ischemic insult.\n\nSubjects will be selected from the stroke population based on an expectation that they would experience a clinically significant improvement. Eligible subjects will have suffered an ischemic stroke involving the cerebral cortex within the last 6 to 36 months. The study will be enrolling 140 subjects and will be randomized to two different treatment arms: experimental group and a waitlist group.\n\nEach subject will receive a series of forty 2 hour treatments, delivered once a day, 5 days a week, within the hyperbaric oxygen chamber.There will be assessments completed before treatment series begins, 3 weeks and 6 weeks into treatment and then again at the end of treatment. After treatment ends, the investigators will conduct these assessments again at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year from the date of the participants last treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Established Stroke"],"keywords":["Hyperbaric Oxygen","HBOT","Hyperbaric Chamber","Pressurized Oxygen"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This arm will receive Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy immediately after consent into study.","interventionNames":["Other: Hyperbaric Oxygen"]},{"label":"Wait list Treatment","type":"OTHER","description":"This arm will receive Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy two months after consenting into study.","interventionNames":["Other: Hyperbaric Oxygen"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hyperbaric Oxygen","description":"The only intervention given will be 100% oxygen under hyperbaric pressure.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment","Wait list Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS-16) from baseline over the duration of the study","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period is completed), During Treatment (3 weeks, 6 weeks) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Nine hole peg board","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Grip Strength","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Test","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"6 metre walk test","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"6 minutes walk test","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Trail Making Test","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Digital Symbol Substitution Test","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD)","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36)","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (9 weeks post baseline, 8 months post and 14 months post)"},{"measure":"Health Economics Questionnaire","timeFrame":"Pre treatment (Baseline and after waiting period) and Post Treatment (5 months, 8 months, 11 months and 14 months)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
