A cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and a blood collection of 5 ml will also be realized.\n\n• V2-V3 (Locomotion /equilibrium assessment visit):\n\nV2 and V3 will begin with tDCS experimental visit (EV) or tDCS placebo visit (PV), the visit order for each patient will be defined by randomization result.\n\nDuring the 2 visits, the tDCS will be placed on the scalp of the patient. The anode will be placed at the hot spot of the tibialis anterior motor cortex area on the damage hemisphere, and the cathode will be placed at the controlateral orbit. The intensity of stimulation will be 2 mA.\n\nIn tDCS experimental visit, the stimulation will last 30 minutes. In tDCS placebo visit, the duration of the stimulation will only be 120 seconds, with the identical other conditions.\n\nBefore the beginning of the stimulation, a clinical assessment, a functional gait related activities evaluation and a 3D gait motion analysis associated with an evaluation of the equilibrium will be performed.\n\nDuring the stimulation period, the gait and the equilibrium assessments, using 3D motion analysis will be done.\n\nAfter the stimulation, the evaluations such as clinical, functional and motion analysis will be realized again.\n\nThe tDCS experimental visit and the tDCS placebo visit will be spaced one week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait Disorders"],"keywords":["tDCS, gait disorders, equilibrium, hemiplegic, stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"sham and then anodal","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"visit 2 sham stimulation (120 seconds) and visit 3 anodal stimulation (30 minutes)","interventionNames":["Device: anodal tDCS and sham tDCS stimulations"]},{"label":"anodal and then sham","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"visit 2 anodal stimulation (30 minutes) and visit 3 sham stimulation (120 seconds)","interventionNames":["Device: anodal tDCS and sham tDCS stimulations"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"anodal tDCS and sham tDCS stimulations","description":"Two conditions will be tested in randomized order: 2 arms in the first one anodal tDCS and then sham tDCS.
