It is the main cause of complex disability, with a high number of people living with its effects. Stroke can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition, sensory processing, cognition, and emotional disturbances, which can affect the performance of functional activities and mental health status. Getting patients involved in art therapy (AT) class has shown to alleviate stress and promote a sense of wellbeing, which can aid their recovery and rehabilitation. The benefits of art therapy for people living with different health conditions worldwide have been reported, however, its effect on Egyptian patients with stroke has been neglected.","detailedDescription":"Art therapy refers to a group of techniques including painting, drawing and listening to music. The participants will receive the program on three steps (early step, middle step, and late step). These steps aim to train the participants on the AT from simple to complex and motivate them to engage in the AT program.Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of art therapy on cognitive ability, arm activity and mental health status of patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke and Hemorrhagic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group (n = 30) will receive Routine Hospital Management (RHM), conventional rehabilitation activity and AT (painting, coloring, listening to music and Hand Therapy Ball Exercises).

It is widely used in stroke survivors and assesses performance attention, concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visual-constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations and orientation. The maximum score is 30 and scores of under 26 indicate cognitive impairment.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)","description":"This measurement consists of two subscales: Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a depression subscale (HADS-D) with 14 intermingled items. Each item is rated on a four-point scale of 0-3, giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression respectively. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale are considered as significant 'case' of psychological comorbidity, a score of 8-10 as borderline while a score of 7 or below is considered as normal.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"The Arm Activity (ArmA) Measure","description":"The ArmA measure is a patient and/or career-reported 20-item measure of difficulty in passive and active hemiparetic arm function. It consists of a seven-item passive function subscale, and 13-item active function subscale. Using a Likert scoring system between zero (no difficulty) and four (unable to do task). The passive function subscale scores range from zero (high function) to 28 and the active function subscale scores range from zero (high function) to 52.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Roger's Happy Sad face","description":"This Roger's scale will be used to assess mood, anxiety, and pain.
