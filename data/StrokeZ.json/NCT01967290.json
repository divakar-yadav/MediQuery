For that purpose the investigators use the SWORD system that combines 3D motion quantification wearable sensors and a vibratory module.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli during a motor rehabilitation task increase significantly the number of correct movements performed per unit of time.\n\nThe design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. With the SWORD system in place each patient will perform the hand-to-mouth task twice (with vibratory feedback and without it), the order being random. The number of correct movements and other motor outcomes will be assessed continuously under both conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Upper Extremity Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["stroke","motor deficits","motor rehabilitation","neurorehabilitation","medical devices","wearable devices","e-health systems"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hand-to-mouth task - vibratory feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hand-to-mouth task under vibratory feedback and 3D movement analysis.
