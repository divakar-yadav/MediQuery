Due to its cost effectiveness and wide accessibility, the possible application or use of IV fluid infusion as first line treatment can aide in the treatment of more acute ischemic stroke patients worldwide. This novel information will aide physicians with more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of utilizing IV fluid in future treatment plans for patients with acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","intravenous fluid","้hydration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IV Fluid","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"0.9% NaCl solution infusion: 100 ml/hr for three days.","interventionNames":["Drug: 0.9% NaCl solution"]},{"label":"No IV Fluid","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Not receive any intravenous fluid but can consume oral fluid normally for three days."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"0.9% NaCl solution","description":"0.9% NaCl solution intravenous infusion: 100 ml/hr for three days.","armGroupLabels":["IV Fluid"],"otherNames":["Normal saline"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS ≤ 4","description":"Patients with good outcome by NIHSS ≤ 4 at day 7 after treatment or on the day of discharge, which ever comes first.","timeFrame":"day 7 after treatment or on the day of discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS ≤ 1","description":"Patients with mRS ≤ 1 at day 7 after treatment or on the day of discharge, which ever comes first.","timeFrame":"day 7 after treatment or on the day of discharge"},{"measure":"mRS ≤ 4","description":"Patients with mRS ≤ 4 at day 90","timeFrame":"at day 90"},{"measure":"mRS ≤ 1","description":"Patients with mRS ≤ 1 at day 90","timeFrame":"at day 90"},{"measure":"change of serum osmolarity","description":"Percentage of change of serum osmolarity at day 3 after treatment","timeFrame":"at day 3 after treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
