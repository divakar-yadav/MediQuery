The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of early administration of sour liquid on swallowing function of patients with post-stroke dysphagia.\n\nMaterials and methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial, which was conducted with 95 patients with confirmed diagnosis of ischemic stroke and dysphagia, admitted to the neurology department of a university hospital. The intervention group (n=47) received 4 ml of room temperature lemon juice, while the control group (n=48) received 4 ml of room temperature water before breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a duration of 7 days. The Standard Swallowing Test, Gagging Swallowing Screen, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale were applied. Swallowing function and stroke severity were assessed at initial assessment, at the end of the 7th and 30th days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["acute stroke","dysphagia","swallowing function","sour taste"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":95,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"4 ml of freshly squeezed lemon juice with a pH of 2.8 at room temperature was administered under the supervision of the physician before breakfast, lunch, and dinner for patients with ischemic stroke.
