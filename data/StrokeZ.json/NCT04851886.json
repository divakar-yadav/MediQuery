To address this question, we plan to carry out a randomized clinical trial to compare outcomes in subjects receiving robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation during individual (i.e., one-on-one) sessions and in subjects receiving robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation during group (i.e., up to three subjects) sessions.","detailedDescription":"The proposed study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of using the PostureCheck (a camera-based system equipped with machine learning algorithms to track the quality of the exercise performance) on motor gains in group and individual robot-assisted upper-limb. Study participants (stroke survivors) will be recruited at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - Boston. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two different groups: individual- or group-therapy using a covariate-adaptive allocation procedure to ensure important covariates, such as baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) scores and proprioceptive deficits, are balanced between groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Study participants will be randomized to either 1) one-on-one robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation, and 2) group (up to three subjects per session) robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Individual robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants randomized to this arm of the study will undergo 18 sessions of robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation.
