The device has FDA approved since 2015 and the firsts Latin American cases were performed in 2012. However, there is no real world data from Latin American experience in terms of success and outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Up to 50 sites in Latin America will participate in the study.\n\nPrimary analyses may include, but will not be limited to, the following: procedural complications, incidence of stroke and death. Descriptive statistics will be used for baseline, procedure and follow-up data collected through the registry.\n\nClinical history of each patient will be analyzed for a period of 6 months after the procedure according the standard practice at the enrolling centers. There will be no additional visits, nor procedures, for subjects in the registry."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","Left atrial appendage","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Left atrial appendage closure with Watchman device","description":"Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure using Watchman device"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of Periprocedural complications","description":"Pericardial effusion, stroke, device embolization and bleeding","timeFrame":"At implant"},{"measure":"Incidence of Stroke","description":"Stroke","timeFrame":"6 months follow up"},{"measure":"Incidence of Death","description":"Cardiovascular and no cardiovascular death","timeFrame":"6 months follow up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who were eligible for a WatchmanTM device implantation according to current international and local guidelines and per physician and institution discretion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient who were currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that would directly interfere with the current study aims.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with atrial fibrillation and indication for left atrial appendage closure","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Centro Medico Docente la Trinidad","city":"Caracas","state":"Miranda","zip":"1080","country":"Venezuela","geoPoint":{"lat":10.48801,"lon":-66.87919}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
