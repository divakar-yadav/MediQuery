The damage of cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke is not lower than the body function defect after stroke. Many studies have shown that oxidative stress is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Many studies have reported that the oxidative-reduction of cells plays an important role in the life activities of organisms, affecting the health, aging and death of the organism. In the recent years, some scholars have suggested that post-stroke cognitive impairment may be related to oxidative-reduction homeostasis of the body, but the relevant evidence is lacking and needs to be further explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of oxidation-reduction homeostasis on cognitive impairment in patients with ischemic stroke, and provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oxidative-reduction Homeostasis","Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment","interventionNames":["Other: No intervention has been conducted"]},{"label":"Patients without post-stroke cognitive impairment","interventionNames":["Other: No intervention has been conducted"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention has been conducted","description":"It is an observational study, and no intervention has been conducted","armGroupLabels":["Patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment","Patients without post-stroke cognitive impairment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Oxidative-reduction homeostasis in acute ischemic stroke patients","description":"Reduced glutathione (GSH)/ Oxidized glutathione (GSSG), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-PX) of acute ischemic stroke patients will be tested.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Cognitive function in acute ischemic stroke patients","description":"Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA) in acute ischemic stroke patients will be evaluated.","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 40-80 years old;\n* Ischemic stroke for the first time or previous stroke but with no serious sequelae (mRS is 0 -2 points);\n* Time from onset to treatment â‰¤48 hours;\n* Conscious awareness, and with no obvious aphasia and visual impairment;\n* Signed informed consent by patient self or legally authorized representatives.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Intracranial hemorrhage or suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage;\n* Transient ischemic attack;\n* Patients with severe mental disorders or language disorders;\n* Patients can not cooperate with evaluators, such as mental illness or dementia;\n* Pregnant women or suckers;\n* Researchers consider patients inappropriate to participate in the registry.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute ischemic stroke patients in hospital from March, 2018 to September, 2018.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"General Hospital of ShenYang Military Region","city":"Shenyang","state":"Liaoning","zip":"10016","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":41.79222,"lon":123.43278}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000060825","term":"Cognitive Dysfunction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000003072","term":"Cognition Disorders"},{"id":"D000019965","term":"Neurocognitive Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M29395","name":"Cognitive Dysfunction","asFound":"Cognitive Impairment","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5991","name":"Cognition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21526","name":"Neurocognitive Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
