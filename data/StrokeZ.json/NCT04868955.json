The participants were randomise to control- or intervention group. Both groups received usual care. The intervention group were instructed to oral screen (IQoro®) training for 13 weeks. Follow up with FEES was made 13 weeks post of recruitment. The assess with FEES was recorded and the recordings are going to be analyzed afterwards to compare the swallowing ability between baseline and follow up in group and between group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Usual care and oral screen (IQoro®) training.","interventionNames":["Other: Oral screen training"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual care."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Oral screen training","description":"Oral screen training (IQoro®) during 13 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in swallowing function due to secretion in the pharynx.","description":"Changes in swallowing function based on the parameter secretion in the pharynx.
