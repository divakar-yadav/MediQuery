The timing of the stimulation in relation to the training will vary by group.","detailedDescription":"This study will look at the differences in improvement of hand and arm function when nerve stimulation is applied at different times in relation to motor training. The nerve stimulation, called peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is non-invasive and painless. Subjects in the study may receive strong or mild PNS. Subjects will also vary by whether PNS is delivered for 2 hours before the 2 hours of motor training, or during the 2 hours of motor training. Which level of stimulation and its timing will be determined randomly for each subject."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["neuroplasticity","rehabilitation","peripheral nerve stimulation","motor training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active PNS during training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Individuals in this group will receive active PNS while participating in 2 hours of motor training of the affected arm.","interventionNames":["Device: Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)","Behavioral: Intensive upper extremity motor training"]},{"label":"Active PNS before training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Individuals in this group will receive 2 hours of active PNS before participating in 2 hours of motor training of the affected arm.","interventionNames":["Device: Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)","Behavioral: Intensive upper extremity motor training"]},{"label":"Sham PNS during training","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Individuals in this group will receive 2 hours of sham PNS while participating in 2 hours of motor training of the affected arm.","interventionNames":["Device: Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)","Behavioral: Intensive upper extremity motor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)","description":"Non-invasive stimulation is applied to 3 nerves of the arm.
