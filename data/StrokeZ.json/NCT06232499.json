Previous studies predominantly used low-energy vascular lasers with red light, specifically helium-neon lasers with a wavelength of 632.8nm. However, different colored lights are absorbed by cells in the body in varying proportions, leading to potentially different effects. Therefore, there is an interest in understanding the impact of other colored lights on stroke patients. To understand the practical effects of low-energy laser treatment with different colored lights on improving neurological function and controlling recurrent stroke risk factors.\n\nMethods:\n\nA randomized crossover trial will be conducted with a study population consisting of individuals aged 20 and above who have experienced their first stroke within the last 6 months. Exclusion criteria include patients with skin conditions unsuitable for injection or light exposure, those with light allergies, pregnant individuals, those with abnormal blood clotting function, those with implanted pacemakers, and individuals unable to comply with the 5-month study plan. Participants will undergo 10 sessions of infrared light and 10 sessions of blue light vascular laser treatment. Blood tests and neurological assessments will be conducted before each treatment session (10 irradiations) and at the end of the two-month washout period between the two different colored lights. Descriptive analysis and pair t-tests will be employed to compare baseline values between the two groups. Subsequently, repeated measures ANOVA will be used to analyze differences between the intervention group and the control group. The study will examine whether various influencing factors are associated with receiving vascular laser treatment with different colored lights."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Intravenous Laser Irradiation of Blood","Recurrent stroke risk factors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Red-Blue Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm first receive 10 sessions of vascular laser treatment with red light, followed by a two-month washout period, and then receive 10 sessions of vascular laser treatment with blue light.","interventionNames":["Device: Intravenous Laser Irradiation of Blood"]},{"label":"Blue-Red Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm first receive 10 sessions of vascular laser treatment with blue light, followed by a two-month washout period, and then receive 10 sessions of vascular laser treatment with red light.","interventionNames":["Device: Intravenous Laser Irradiation of Blood"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intravenous Laser Irradiation of Blood","description":"The different color lights for Intravenous Laser Irradiation of Blood are red light at 808nm and blue light at 415nm","armGroupLabels":["Blue-Red Arm","Red-Blue Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test","description":"Can reveal whether your urea nitrogen levels are higher than normal, suggesting that your kidneys may not be working properly.","timeFrame":"before treatment, two weeks after trial began, 2 months and two weeks after trial began, 3 months after trial began, 5 months after trial began"},{"measure":"Creatinine test","description":"Measure of how well your kidneys are performing their job of filtering waste from your blood.","timeFrame":"before treatment, two weeks after trial began, 2 months and two weeks after trial began, 3 months after trial began, 5 months after trial began"},{"measure":"Uric acid levels","description":"Uric acid levels are typically 2.5-7.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) in males and 1.5-6.0 mg/dL in females.
