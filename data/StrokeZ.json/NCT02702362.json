But the effects went down after 1 or 2 hours. To increase the lasting of the effects, a new study will evaluate the effects of tDCS on the precuneus cortex for 5 consecutive days in chronic patients in MCS.\n\n2 sessions of 5 days of stimulation will be realized, one session will be real (anodal stimulation) and one placebo (sham stimulation). After each stimulation, behavioral improvement will be assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R). A final assessment will be done 5 days after the end of the sessions to assess the long term effect of the tDCS.\n\nResearchers expected to see an improvement of the CRS-R total score at the end of the anodal session and that this improvement persists for 5 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patients in Minimally Conscious State After a Severe Brain Injury"],"keywords":["disorders of consciousness","minimally conscious state","traumatic brain injury","stroke","transcranial direct current stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"anodal stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients received anodal tDCS (on the precuneus ) every day for 5 days (tDCS of 2mA during 20minutes).
