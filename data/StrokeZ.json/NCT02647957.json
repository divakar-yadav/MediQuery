The objective of this study was to define quality indicators and to compare treatment outcomes in hospitals where Code Stroke has been implemented and hospitals without the use of Code Stroke (control patients).","detailedDescription":"In a first step qualitative technique has been conducted to define treatment quality indicators of acute ischemic stroke patients. In a second step a prospective study is conducted to collect data of 240 inpatients from two groups of hospitals. Two hospitals applying Code Stroke (N= 120) and four hospitals non-applying Code Stroke procedure (N=120). A consecutive sampling method will be conducted. Inclusion criteria: acute ischemic stroke patients treated in the hospitals during the field study. The referral to the hospital could be from primary care, Emergency Unit of other hospital. Patients will enroll after inform consent.\n\nA Singer-blind- research method will applied. Quality indicators defined in the first phase will be applied and comparisons will be realized using ANOVA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","quality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":240,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hospital using Code Stroke","interventionNames":["Procedure: Code Stroke"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Hospital not using Code Stroke"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Code Stroke","description":"Apply a protocol called Code Stroke that involves the entire care chain from emergency teams outpatient specialists of Neurology, Internal Medicine, Radiology or Intensitivos Care, among other hospital areas.","armGroupLabels":["Group A"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recovery rate of the Intravenous trombolysis treatment","description":"Number of patients showing an adequate recovery after Intravenous trombolysis treatment as assessed by the criteria of the Quality Indicator Board of the German Stroke Registers Study Group and the National Sentinel Audit of Stroke.","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient satisfaction","description":"Patient Satisfaction Scale","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Patient engage","description":"Health literacy Scale","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"response capacity","description":"Response time for the initial evaluation and treatment","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Treatment adequacy: Intravenous trombolysis treatment","description":"Intravenous trombolysis treatment applied in eligible ischemic stroke patients","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Patient safety.
