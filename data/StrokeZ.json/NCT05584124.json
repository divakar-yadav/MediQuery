Fatigue is a common condition after a stroke and can negatively impact an individual's ability to perform desired social and physical activities. Magnetic stimulation of the brain has been shown to improve signs and symptoms of related psychological (e.g., depression) conditions. Participants in this trial will receive a type of magnetic stimulation called repetitive magnetic stimulation, or rTMS. The investigators will measure feelings of fatigue, and other clinical characteristics related to mood and cognition, before and after participants receive rTMS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Chronic","Fatigue"],"keywords":["non-invasive brain stimulation","post-stroke fatigue","perception of fatigue","repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","rTMS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will be blinded to their groups","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real M1 High Frequency rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be randomly assigned to receive high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the top of their head for approximately 40 minutes.","interventionNames":["Device: High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Real LDLPFC High Frequency rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be randomly assigned to receive high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left frontal part of their head for approximately 40 minutes.","interventionNames":["Device: High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be randomly assigned to receive sham/placebo repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the their head for approximately 40 minutes.
