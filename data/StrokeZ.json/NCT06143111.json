The FloTrac system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) continuously monitors cardiac output (CO) and SVV (SVV-FloTrac) by analyzing the systemic arterial pressure wave. Numerous studies have demonstrated that SVV-FloTrac serves as a reliable indicator of fluid responsiveness. However, its peripheral invasiveness raises concerns about susceptibility to reflecting waves, damping, and vascular tone influences.In contrast, Transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (BioZ.com™) offers a non-invasive approach for continuously monitoring various hemodynamic variables. In this study, the primary aim was to assess the agreement between simultaneously measured SVV-FloTrac and SVV-BioZ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Volume Variation","SVV-FloTrac","Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance","Fluid Responsiveness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Flotrac Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this group,an arterial catheter was inserted preoperatively.
