Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they had DM and were 55 years of age or older. All treatment decisions, regarding all aspects of care and follow-up of the study participants, remained at the discretion of the individual's primary care physician, who was blinded to the individual's Hp type. Hp distribution was: Hp 1-1 285 (9.4%); Hp 2-1 1248 (41.0%); Hp 2-2 1511 (49.6%).\n\nHypothesis: strict glucose control (HbA1c\\<7%) reduces the rate of cardiovascular events only to diabetic patients with the Hp 2-2 phenotype. We also postulated that, since Hp 2-2 DM individuals are at an increased genetic susceptibility for cardiovascular disease (CVD), this unique cohort merits an investigation on the associations between various CVD risk variables and CVD events and establish whether any evident association was dependent of the individual's Hp type."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Cardiovascular Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke"],"keywords":["Diabetes Mellitus","Cardiovascular Disease","Haptoglobin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3054,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite of major CVD events (non fatal MI, Stroke and CVD death)","description":"Clinical data (eg.
