LVO is a major predictor of unfavorable outcomes in stroke patients, and the most effective imaging modalities for its detection remain a topic of debate.\n\nTo address this, the investigators will enroll consecutive AIS patients with LVO screened under different imaging modalities and compared the efficacy of endovascular therapy (EVT) and best medical management (BMM). The registry defines LVO as an occlusion of the intracranial ICA with or without the involvement of the terminal bifurcation, M1 and/or M2 segment of the MCA, A1 and/or A2 segment of the ACA, VA, BA, or P1 and/or P2 segment of the PCA. Patient information, including basic demographic profiles, imaging characteristics such as volume of ischemic core and occlusion site, and treatment-related complications will be collected for both EVT and BMM groups. For patients in the EVT group, detailed information on the EVT procedure and angiographic images will also be collected.\n\nThe study aims to identify the optimal imaging modalities for LVO detection and to compare the prognosis of AIS patients with LVO receiving EVT versus BMM. This academic, real-world, multi-center, observational registry will contribute valuable insights to improve the detection and treatment of LVO in AIS patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of stroke on public health and socio-economic development."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic","Endovascular Procedures","Large Vessel Occlusion"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Therapy","Large Vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular therapy","description":"Timely thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion by either stent retriever, thrombus aspiration, others, or combination methods.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular Therapy"]},{"label":"Best medical management","description":"Patients enrolled in this group received the best medical management."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular Therapy","description":"Endovascular therapy, as an adjunct to standard stroke therapy, may be beneficial for a very select population of patients who present with an acute ischemic stroke and have a proven large, proximal occlusion on imaging.\n\nEndovascular therapy includes any one or more of the following:\n\nIntra-arterial thrombolytic therapy, aspiration, stent retrieval, or a combination of multiple mechanical devices.","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified ranking scale (mRS) at 90 days","description":"A 0-6 scale running from perfect health without symptoms to death.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Mortality within 90 days","description":"mortality of any causes.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at 90 days","description":"The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4.
