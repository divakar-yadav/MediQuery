All three groups will receive usual care, in addition to the intervention. The Stroke Management Group will be provided with periodic information about their progress in the area of mobility using specialized activity monitors. The Stroke Monitoring Group will be progressed according to customized protocols using feedback from specialized activity monitors. The Stroke Supplementary Group will receive the same as the Stroke Monitoring Group, but will also receive one additional hour of daily (5 times per week) physical exercise"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous
