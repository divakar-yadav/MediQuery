It will be conducted in the United States under the approval of one or more recognized institutional review boards and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines defined in International Standards Organization:14155;2011, the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable federal and local laws and regulations. Only on label uses of the VeriSight ICE catheter will be allowed. No specific claims are being validated during this registry, though data analyzed from this protocol are intended to inform of future claims regarding the performance and safety of the VeriSight catheter.\n\nEnrolled patients will be imaged with VeriSight for various types of percutaneous cardiac interventional procedures. Enrolled subjects will be followed until discharge or ≤48 hrs post-procedure. The registry has a planned duration of approximately 24-36 months with interim analysis planned at 100 patients before further enrollment will be considered. Statistical hypotheses are not intended for this registry and descriptive analysis will be conducted. Data from all clinical sites are intended to be pooled for analysis. It is possible that sub-analyses may be conducted to demonstrate VeriSight guidance for target intervention types in structural heart and electrophysiology procedures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Valve Disease, Heart","Atrial Septal Defect","Patent Foramen Ovale","Mitral Valve Disease","Tricuspid Valve Disease","Aortic Valve Disease"],"keywords":["ICE","Image guided therapy","Structural Heart","Electrophysiology","Intracardiac echocardiography","Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Ablation","Valve Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":155,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Prospective Observational","description":"Prospective observational subjects undergoing planned cardiac procedures utilizing image guidance","interventionNames":["Device: ICE Image guidance"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ICE Image guidance","description":"ICE image guidance will be used on all patients undergoing planned cardiac catheterization procedures","armGroupLabels":["Prospective Observational"],"otherNames":["Philips VeriSight ICE Catheter"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Technical Success","description":"Successful delivery of VeriSight to the target intracardiac position and sustained device operation during the procedure","timeFrame":"During procedure"},{"measure":"Imaging Success","description":"Adequate image quality as determined by the investigator.","timeFrame":"During procedure"},{"measure":"Clinical Success","description":"Adequacy of VeriSight imaging for visualization of major cardiac structures, and guiding procedural intervention, and ability to detect/ assess intra-procedural complications.","timeFrame":"During procedure"},{"measure":"Device-related adverse event detection","description":"Detect device-related adverse events periprocedural through discharge or ≤48 hours post-procedure, whichever is earlier.","timeFrame":"Procedure through 48 hours or discharge, whichever is earlier"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18 years of age and willing to provide written, dated and signed, informed consent\n2.
