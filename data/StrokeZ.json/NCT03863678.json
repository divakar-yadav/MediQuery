In this study, goniometric measurement, Modified Ashworth Scale, Nine Hole Peg Test, 10 Meter Walking Test, Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale and Functional Independence Scale will be used for outcome measurement. The participants will be randomised into two groups; Group 1 will receive NDT and Group 2 will receive both NDT and dry needling therapy. Both groups will be given 45 minutes of NDT, 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12 sessions). Group 2 will also receive dry needling therapy 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12 sessions). Dry needling will be applied on M. Gastrocnemius, M.Quadriceps, M.Flexor Carpi Radialis and M.Biceps Brachii muscles. The application time on each muscle will be 60 seconds (sec). Fast in and fast out technique will be used for dry needling therapy. All patients will be measured before treatment (T1) and after treatment (T3). An inter-measurement will be performed after the treatment session (T2) in addition to T1 and T3 measurements in the Group 2, to evaluate the acute effects of dry needling therapy. No additional treatment will be applied to the Group 1. All assessments will be performed by the same physiotherapist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)"],"keywords":["dry needling","neurodevelopmental therapy","spasticity","balance","functions","independence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurodevelopmental therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group 1 will only receive Neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT), for 12 sessions.","interventionNames":["Other: Neurodevelopemental therapy (NDT)"]},{"label":"Neurodevelopemental therapy and dry needling therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group 2 will receive Neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT) and dry needling therapy, for 12 sessions.","interventionNames":["Other: Neurodevelopemental therapy (NDT) and dry needling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neurodevelopemental therapy (NDT)","description":"NDT treatment will be given for 45 minutes, 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12 sessions).","armGroupLabels":["Neurodevelopmental therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neurodevelopemental therapy (NDT) and dry needling","description":"NDT treatment will be given for 45 minutes, 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12 sessions).
