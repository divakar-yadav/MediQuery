IV fluids, IV phenylephrine and/or IV norepinephrine are used to rapidly raise mean arterial pressure in a controlled manner as serial assessments of neurologic function are performed.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicenter, pilot clinical trial. The primary outcome variables will be the presence or absence of improvement in NIHSS during treatment with induced hypertension and the number of adverse events. The secondary outcome variables will be final infarct size on MRI at 1 month and Barthel Index and Modified Rankin Scale at 3 months.\n\nAll patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who are willing to participate will receive intervention to induce hypertension, including intravenous saline, phenylephrine (neosynephrine) or levophed, and possibly oral midodrine. Blood pressure will be increased to a maximum mean arterial pressure (MAP) that is 30% above the baseline MAP as measured in the emergency department. The acute phase of the study will last for 3-5 days (for responders) and all patients will be followed up at 1 and 3 months post stroke onset. All patients will undergo neurologic, cognitive, and physical examinations as well as serial MRI studies with diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging.\n\nPrimary hypotheses will be measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and MRI. Improvement following induced hypertension will be measured by comparing NIHSS performed at multiple time points throughout the study. The ability to predict diffusion-perfusion mismatch will be determined by comparing MRI #1 and MRI #2. NIHSS and MRI will also be compared to determine if NIHSS correlates with reperfusion area on MRI.\n\nThe secondary hypothesis of improved long-term outcome will be measured using the Barthel Index, the modified Rankin Scale, and MRI/Flair at 1 and 3 months post stroke symptom onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"intravenous saline"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"intravenous phenylephrine"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"intravenous levophed"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"oral midodrine"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS during the intervention and at 30 and 90 days"},{"measure":"MRI at post intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel Index at 30 and 90 days"},{"measure":"Rankin at 30 and 90 days"},{"measure":"MRI at 30 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with acute ischemic stroke in whom treatment can be initiated within 12 hours of a clearly defined symptom onset.

investigational trial within 30 days.\n* Moderate to severe baseline disability (pre-stroke Rankin score of \\> 3), severe or terminal concurrent medical illness with expected survival of \\< 3
