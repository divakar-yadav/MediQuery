About 30% of patients with minor stroke have a 90-day functional disability. Radiologically proven a large vessel occlusion (LVO) in patients with minor stroke is a well-established predictor of poor outcomes, while the poor outcomes following best medical management in patients with minor stroke with the underlying presence of a LVO are mainly driven by the occurrence of early neurological deterioration (END).\n\nConsidering the well-known strong association between lack of arterial recanalization and END, endovascular therapy (EVT) appears as an attractive option to improve functional outcomes for LVO-related patients with stroke with mild symptoms. Whether EVT is safe and effective in patients with mild stroke with an LVO is currently debated, since these patients were typically excluded from the pivotal EVT trials.\n\nThe current study aimed to further test the hypothesis that endovascular therapy would be superior to medical management with respect to functional recovery among low NIHSS patients caused by acute large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Mild Neurocognitive Disorder","Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Drug: Best medical management Procedure: Endovascular therapy","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":264,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EVT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the procedure, the methods including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty and stenting can be used according to the local interventionalists' choice.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular therapy"]},{"label":"Best medical management","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"All the patients enrolled received standard guideline-directed medical therapy including: monitor vital signs, management of blood pressure, glucose and lipids, antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy determined by treating physician) therapy if appropriate.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular therapy","Drug: Best medical management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular therapy","description":"Drug: Best medical management All the patients enrolled received standard guideline-directed medical therapy including: monitor vital signs, management of blood pressure, glucose and lipids, antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy determined by treating physician) therapy if appropriate.\n\nProcedure: Endovascular therapy In the procedure, the methods including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty and stenting can be used according to the local interventionalists' choice.
