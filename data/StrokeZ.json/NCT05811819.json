They will be invited to participate in a 15-day trial involving the IRegained device. The study will involve 2 assessment visits to McMaster, before and after the treatment, and 15 treatment visits. The data from the pilot study will be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, as outcomes and explicit feedback from participants will be used to further optimize the device for future studies.","detailedDescription":"This pilot study will investigate the potential changes in the brain area controlling hand movement following 15 days of exercises to improve hand function in participants with upper limb impairments resulting from stroke. A device developed by Dr. Vineet Johnson (IRegained Inc.) will be used to administer standardized exercises to improve hand function. To assess brain changes, transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses will be delivered to the motor cortex. The motor evoked potential (MEP), a muscle response evoked from the TMS, will be measured using electrodes on the hand. This study will test the feasibility of conducting motor therapy using this device while assessing potential changes in motor cortex function. Findings from this study will contribute to developing treatment trials aimed at improving impaired limb function in stroke patients and quality of life in these individuals"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hand Function"],"keywords":["Hand Function","Rehabilitation","stroke rehabilitation","Motor control","Hand Rehabilitation","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurorehabilitation of the Hand","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will undergo a 1-hour training session 5 days per week, over 3 weeks for a total of 15 sessions.
