These results were recently extended to the first clinical trial, in which patients with stroke demonstrated significant improvements in upper limb function following rehabilitation paired with implanted VNS. Currently, vagus nerve stimulation is being used clinically to treat a number of human diseases including migraine headaches, epilepsy, and depression, and these investigations are expanding to deliver stimulation via a transcutaneous route to potentially improve intervention efficacy and decrease side effects. This pilot study will combine non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve with upper limb robotic therapy to investigate the potential of tVNS to augment improvements gained with robotic therapy in patients with chronic hemiparesis after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)","VNS","robotic therapy","occupational therapy","motor rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a double-blind, sham controlled treatment study in which patients will have a 50/50 chance of receiving robotic arm therapy with either active transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) or sham tVNS (placebo).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Both the participants and investigators performing and analyzing clinical and objective outcome measures will remain blind to condition.
