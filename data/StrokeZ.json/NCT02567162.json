It was formed to provide clinician-scientists around the world a comprehensive database to direct future studies toward better understanding of ICH. MNEMONICH will help examine global variability in the prevalence of ICH and identify research priorities.\n\nNew data for MNEMONICH will be prospectively collected on a wide range of features including demographics, medical history, dates and times of symptom onset, presentation symptoms, hemodynamic signs, initial and chronic medical therapy, diagnostic imaging, laboratory and genetic analyses, pathological data, and surgical and medical management. Future research will be based upon ad hoc analysis of this data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Intracerebral hemorrhage","Hemorrhagic stroke","Intraparenchymal hemorrhage","Cerebrovascular disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale score","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) met by clinical and imaging criteria\n* Age 18 and above\n* Able to consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* ICH due to trauma\n* ICH due to vascular malformation or aneurysm\n* ICH due to brain tumor\n* ICH due to underlying infectious lesion (e.g., abscess)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients hospitalized for ICH will be asked to provide their permission for the use of this information for retrospective research studies directed at ICH; such research to be conducted by the MNEMONICH investigators.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mario Di Napoli, MD","affiliation":"Centre for Cardiovascular Medicine and Cerebrovascular Disease Prevention","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Mahmoud R Azarpazhooh, MD","affiliation":"Western University, Canada","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Reza Behrouz, DO","affiliation":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Luca Masotti, MD","affiliation":"Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Adrian R Parry-Jones, MBChB, PhD","affiliation":"University of Manchester and the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Aurel Popa-Wagner, MD, PhD","affiliation":"University of Rostock","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Mark A Slevin, PhD","affiliation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Craig J Smith, MBChB, MD","affiliation":"University of Manchester and the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Daniel A Godoy, MD","affiliation":"Hospital Interzonal de Agudos San Juan Bautista","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Floris H Schreuder, MD","affiliation":"Maastricht University Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Michael W Hoffmann, MBChB, PhD","affiliation":"University of Central Florida","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"26745705","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Behrouz R, Azarpazhooh MR, Godoy DA, Hoffmann MW, Masotti L, Parry-Jones AR, Popa-Wagner A, Schreuder FH, Slevin MA, Smith CJ, Di Napoli M; MNEMONICH Steering Committee.
