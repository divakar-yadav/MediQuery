However, few previous studies have focused on affective impairment after transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke. Stroke survivors are often described as apathetic. Even though post-stroke apathy (PSA) affects one in three stroke patients,it has not hitherto received much attention. NICE-A is a prospective study aimed to explore the association between baseline apathy and probable incident stroke in a population-based sample of TIA and minor stroke adults.","detailedDescription":"Transient ischemic attack (TIA) and acute minor ischemic stroke, are common and may leave impermanent or mild neurological deficit, they are termed as non-disabling ischemic cerebrovascular disease (NICE). TIA and minor stroke exhibit the common substantial risk factors for early stroke recurrence and epidemiological characteristic, with approximately 10 to 20% of patients having a stroke within 3 months after the index event.\n\nPrevious studies has shown that post-stroke apathy (PSA) affects one in three stroke patients, which is consistently associated with a worse level of functional recovery, poorer overall health and poorer quality of life. However, still little is known about the development of TIA and minor stroke patients with apathy. Thus, it is imperative to find the relationships between baseline PSA and probable incident stroke in these patients.\n\nNICE is an attractive researching area globally. According to the large quantities of NICE patients in China and the low standardized therapeutic rate, the awareness of TIA and minor stroke is largely insufficient. The purpose of the present NICE-A study is to establish the prevalence, predictors and evolution of symptoms of PSA in TIA and minor stroke patients during the first post-stroke year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Apathy","Minor Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Stroke"],"keywords":["Apathy","minor stroke","Transient Ischemic
