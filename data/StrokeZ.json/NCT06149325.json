The participant's performance after receiving Sham stimulation will be unchanged compared to the baseline performance measured before the stimulation. On the contrary, participant's performance after receiving RSS stimulation will show a considerable improvement compared to the baseline performance, proving the superiority of RSS stimulation over the control. The study has a cross-over design, where each participant receives both stimulations, on different days. The two stimulations will be administered in a randomized order across participants, and in double-blind.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Experimenter 2 will be in charge of the randomization. He will establish a randomization list through Excel and assign to each patient one of the two possible order (Day 1 RSS / Day 2 Sham OR Day 1 Sham / Day 2 RSS). This Excel will be protected through a password and kept in the CRNL server. He will then fill the envelopes with the order assigned by the randomization list and seal them. Each envelope is assigned an inclusion number.\n\nOn the inclusion visit (J0), once the consent form is signed, the sealed envelope will be kept in the medical file of the patient. On the first visit (J1). Experimenter 1 will assess the performance of the patient through the tactile and motor tests, while the Exp2 will be in charge of applying the stimulation.\n\nOnce Exp1 finished doing the tactile and motor tasks, she will leave the room and Exp2 will enter in the room, open the sealed envelope and apply the stimulation. He will stay in the room with the patient during the stimulation duration.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Repetitive somatosensory stimulation (RSS), then SHAM","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Adult patients suffering from post-stroke sensory deficits at the hand.
