The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and laboratory data of patients who were rehospitalised due to \"stroke rehabilitation cause only\" The patients who were hospitalized in the hospital between January 2015 and July 2018, according to ICD 10 code; hemiplegia (G81), flaccid hemiplegia (G81.0), hemiplegia, unspecified (G81.9), Spastic hemiplegia (G81.1) scanned from the hospital database.\n\nThere were 554 patients with these diagnoses. 9 patients of them were excluded because of the hemiplegic due to trauma, cancer and intracranial operation. Detailed epicrisis of 545 patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were examined. 328 patients who did not have missing data were included in the study. Age, sex, hemiplegia etiology, admission season, hemiplegia time, hemiplegic side, 25 (OH) vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels, brunnstrom stage of upper extremity, lower extremity and hand Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC).\n\nBrunnstrom staging was used to identify motor function with 6 levels in the upper extremity and hand. ROM for abduction, flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation were passively measured. Brunnstrom staging was used to evaluate motor development, and stroke patients were defined as 6 stages. The flask phase without the lowest voluntary movement is considered to be stage 1, while the presence of isolated movements is considered to be stage 6. In the Brunstromm staging, upper, lower extremity and hand evaluation are performed separately.\n\nFAC is defined as 5 stages according to the basic motor skills required for functional ambulation. FAC stage 0 is used for non-functional ambulation, stage 5 is used for independent walking at each speed and ground."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":328,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hospitalisation group","description":"The patients who were hospitalized in the hospital between January 2015 and July 2018, according to ICD 10 code; hemiplegia (G81), flaccid hemiplegia (G81.0), hemiplegia, unspecified (G81.9), Spastic hemiplegia (G81.1) scanned from the hospital database.","interventionNames":["Other: age, sex, hemiplegic side, stroke duration, First hospitalisation duration (day)"]},{"label":"Re-hospitalisation group.","description":"The patients who were re-hospitalized in the hospital between January 2015 and July 2018, according to ICD 10 code; hemiplegia (G81), flaccid hemiplegia (G81.0), hemiplegia, unspecified (G81.9), Spastic hemiplegia (G81.1) scanned from the hospital database.","interventionNames":["Other: age, sex, hemiplegic side, stroke duration, First hospitalisation duration (day)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"age, sex, hemiplegic side, stroke duration, First hospitalisation duration (day)","description":"This is a retrospiective descriptive study","armGroupLabels":["Hospitalisation group","Re-hospitalisation group."],"otherNames":["Corelation of data, FAC: Functional Ambulation Classification and age, stroke duration, Season, stroke Etiology, Brunnstrom, FAC"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rehospitalisation rates","description":"rehospitalisation rates.
