Even if periprocedural cerebral microembolism associated with carotid endarterectomy or stenting usually does not manifest as clinically overt stroke, neuropsychological disturbances resulting from these events represent an important clinical and socioeconomic problem. Still, it remains unclear whether the use proximal protection can lower the incidence of cerebral embolism associated with the treatment of carotid stenosis.\n\nMaterials and methods. This was a prospective randomised single-centre study, which was aimed at comparison of surgical eversion endarterectomy with stenting under proximal protection in symptomatic patients. The investigators evaluated the incidence of new ischaemic lesions revealed by the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 2-4 days after the treatment and neurologic events.","detailedDescription":"The CARECarotid was a prospective randomised single-centre study, which was performed in the University Hospital in Kraków. It was planned to evaluate 50 patients presenting with symptomatic lesions of the internal carotid artery.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms: surgical endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty with stenting under proximal protection. All patients provided their written informed consent to undergo the procedures and to participate in this trial.\n\nIn all surgical patients carotid endarterectomy will perform using the eversion technique. All surgical endarterectomies will perform under cervical block anaesthesia.\n\nPerioperatively patients in the surgical arm received aspirin; other antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents were not administered during 5 days before surgery.\n\nAll procedures in carotid artery stenting will perform with proximal protection system - the Mo.Ma (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) device. The investigators will implante stents that were tailored to the localisation of lesions and morphology of carotid arteries: Carotid Wallstent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA, and in patients with tortuous arteries Precise Pro RX (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA) or Roadsaver (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Patients in the stent arm will receive clopidogrel 75 mg/day and aspirin 75 mg/day. These drugs were administered during 3 days before planned procedure and then 3-6 months after stent implantation. All patients will have MRI DWI performed before and 2-4 days after procedures in both groups. Within 6 months there will be an evaluation of the incidence of neurological events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Stenosis","Carotid Atherosclerosis","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["carotid angioplaty","MRI DWI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms: surgical endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty with stenting under proximal protection","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carotid Artery Stenting","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will undergo carotid artery angioplasty and stenting with any CE-certificated carotid stent with a proximal protection system Mo.Ma","interventionNames":["Procedure: Carotid Artery Stenting"]},{"label":"Endarterectomy carotid artery","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will undergo carotid endarterectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endarterectomy carotid artery"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Carotid Artery Stenting","description":"Carotid artery stenting was considered successful if there was no residual stenosis greater than 20%, and there was no dissection of target artery following the procedure.","armGroupLabels":["Carotid Artery Stenting"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endarterectomy carotid artery","description":"Surgical endarterectomy was considered successful if there was no residual stenosis after procedure, without symptoms.","armGroupLabels":["Endarterectomy carotid artery"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of new ischemic brain injury detectable on MRI after carotid artery stenting and endarterectomy.","description":"Number of patients with treatment related new ipsilateral cerebral embolic lesions in brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging within 2-4 days post carotid artery stenting and endarterectomy.
