Baseline data without the device will be collected prior to receiving the MyoPro. Data with and without the device will then be collected at 2-weeks post fitting and then at 1-month intervals thereafter for 12 months. These outcome measures will enable an understanding of the participants' functional gains with and without the MyoPro and over time with the MyoPro."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brachial Plexus Injury","Spinal Cord Injuries","Neurological
