To explore effect of sarcopenia on recovery of post stroke hemiplegia\n2. To explore the effect of stroke on sarcopenia and relationship between the degree of sarcopenia and respiration and swallowing function\n3. To quantify and qualify post stroke loss of muscle mass\n4. To validity the use of echointensity and elastography in evaluation of sarcopenia.\n\nBy reaching the above list purposes, sarcopenia can be viewed as one of serious post stroke complications that is closely related to worth functional outcome, thereby emphasizing the importance of evaluation of sarcopenia as well as its prevention.","detailedDescription":"Sarcopenia occurs frequently among old population. The changes can rather occur earlier after trauma or generalized illness. However, the nature of these sarcopenia is different from that of geriatric population. Post stroke sarcopenia is underestimated however reduction in the motor uni number begins within 4 hours post stroke and after 3 weeks, sarcopenia can be seen in both hemiplegia and normal side. This muscular weakness can hinder functional recovery process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcopenia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normal subjects without stroke","description":"1. subjects who can walk independent without any difficult\n2. subjects without history of CNS or PNS lesion\n3.
