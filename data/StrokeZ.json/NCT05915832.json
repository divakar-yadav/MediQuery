Phase difference (PD) in degree can therefore serve as a useful tool in the evaluation of cerebral autoregulation. Continuous cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) in cm/s of bilateral middle cerebral artery will be assessed noninvasively using transcranial Doppler. Spontaneous arterial blood pressure (ABP) in mmHg will be simultaneously recorded using a servo-controlled plethysmograph on the left or right middle finger with an appropriate finger cuff size. Data on CBFV and ABP were processed using MATLAB using scripts developed by the research team. PD was then derived from transfer function analysis to assess the dynamic association between CBFV and ABP.","timeFrame":"0 - 7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
