There is a need for innovative, long-term and economically-feasible interventions for those with chronic stroke. Recently, a focus has been placed on the use of virtual reality and interactive gaming as a low cost and effective manner of treating movement disorders. Yet few studies have investigated interactive gaming platforms effect on balance following stroke. The proposed study is a randomized, single-blind, control group cross-over study for individuals with chronic stroke designed to examine an innovative therapeutic approach by investigating the effects of commercially-available gaming systems on balance, mobility and fear of falling in a sample of individuals with chronic motor deficits following stroke.","detailedDescription":"Objective: To determine if playing active video games results in improved balance and motor performance.\n\nDesign: Randomized-matched, single-blind, control group cross-over study Setting: Laboratory Patients: Participants with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke were randomly assigned to a gaming group or normal activity control group.\n\nInterventions: Gaming systems provided an interactive interface of real-time movement of either themselves or an avatar on the screen. Participants played games 1 hour/day, 4 days/week, for 5 weeks, totaling 20 hours of game-play. The intervention was strictly game-play without physical therapy. All games were played in standing position and trainers supervised to protect against loss of balance.\n\nMeasurements: Both groups were tested prior to and following the 5 weeks (post-test) and 3 months following the completion of the intervention/control. Outcome measures included: Fugl-Meyer Motor Exam, Single Leg Stance time, symmetrical weight bearing, Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go, Six Minute Walk, 3 Meter Walk, step length differential, and perception of recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Immediate Treatment Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Commercially-Available Interactive Video Games"]},{"label":"Delayed Treatment Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Commercially-Available Interactive Video Games","description":"Two commercially available gaming platforms were used in this study, the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PS 2.
