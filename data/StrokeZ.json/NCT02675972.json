The obscured definition and measurement of BPV engenders considerable confounding factors, making it difficult to interpret. We aim to investigate the predictive role of 24-hour BPV on early outcomes in acute non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"This is a perspective registered cohort study. Patients with acute non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke are included into the study. During the first 24 hours after admission, the 24 hours blood pressure monitoring is to be taken and used to calculate various parameters of hour-to-hour blood pressure variability, including standard deviation(SD), coefficient of variation (CV), variation independent of mean(VIM) and average real variability (ARV) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The demographic and clinical data are also recorded. This is an observational sturdy, thus the caring physician make clinical decisions according to individual patient's condition. The endpoints are defined as early neurological deterioration, functional outcome(modified Rankin scale\\<3 as good outcome) at discharge and 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, blood pressure, prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"fasting glucose, creatine, BNP, CRP,BUN,cholesterol, LDL,HDL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":260,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patient with poor outcome","description":"modified Rankin scale≥3"},{"label":"patients with favorable outcome","description":"modified Rankin scale\\<3"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"early neurological deterioration","description":"NIHSS increase by 4 points or continuous consciousness deterioration","timeFrame":"7 days after admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"good functional outcome at 14 days","description":"good functional outcomes as mRS≤2; poor outcome as mRS ≥3","timeFrame":"up to 14 days in-hospital"},{"measure":"good functional outcome at 3 months","description":"good functional outcomes as mRS≤2; poor outcome as mRS ≥3","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute ischemic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* cardiogenic cerebral embolisms due to atrial fibrillation, pronounced heart valve diseases or valve replacement operation;\n* isolated sensory symptoms, isolated visual changes, isolated dizziness, or vertigo, without explicit MRI-DWI evidence for acute cerebral infarcts;\n* coexisting severe systematic diseases on admission such as acute coronary syndrome, malignant tumor, plasma dialysis therapy for renal failure, cirrhosis, rheumatic disease which would influence patients' independent functions .","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"acute ischemic stroke patients with 72 hour after onset","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"zhu Shi, PhD,MD","affiliation":"dongguan peoples' hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Dongguan Peoples' Hospital","city":"Dongguan","state":"Guangdong","zip":"523029","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":23.01797,"lon":113.74866}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28203689","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Shi Z, Li ES, Zhong JS, Yuan JL, Li LR, Zheng CW.
