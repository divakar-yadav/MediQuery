The SWORD system combines inertial motion trackers and a mobile app, allowing digitization of patient motion and providing real-time audiovisual biofeedback.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the biofeedback feedback provided by the SWORD system improves patient performance, defined as an increase in the number of correct movements.\n\nThe design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. Patients will be randomized into two groups. Both will perform two separate sessions consisting of one exercise - shoulder flexion with elbow flexion at 90 degrees - for 4 minutes in both experimental settings: with and without biofeedback. Group 1 will perform the exercise with biofeedback first and without biofeedback after, with an interval \\>24h. Group 2 will perform the exercise in the opposite order. The SWORD system will be used to record movement data in both sessions, but the feedback was only active in one of them."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SWORD and exercise with biofeedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patient will perform one repetition of the exercise shoulder flexion with elbow flexion at 90 degrees under monitoring from SWORD.

During the session, SWORD will be providing real-time audiovisual feedback. The patient has to start in the baseline position and fill the progress bar without violating movement or posture constraints. If the patient does not reach the goal or violates constraints he will receive a negative audio feedback, the progress bar will turn red and be reset.
