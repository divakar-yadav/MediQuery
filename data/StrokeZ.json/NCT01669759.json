Although fatigue is a common symptom after stroke, but it is easy to neglect due to fatigue is a non-specific symptom. Based on the literature review, fatigue symptom is not only common on post-stroke patient and it also has highly correlation with mortality, prognosis and efficacy of rehabilitation. In Traditional Chinese Medicine recording, Wang Qing-ren suggests that the main etiology of stroke is results from qi stagnation and blood stasis, thereafter, the study about qi deficiency and blood stasis became to the main stream for stroke until now. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between the severity of fatigue, and the severity of qi deficiency and blood stasis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Poststroke Fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"fatigue"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frome Fatigue severity level scale to evaluate fatigue severity score.","description":"When patient visit first time,we complete all the evaluation scale.
