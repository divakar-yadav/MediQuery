During the first part, the investigators propose to conduct an enrollment of patients after thrombectomy in acute Ischemic Stroke and healthy controls. Serum biomarkers levels were analyzed (before and after) endovascular treatment patients and controls respectively.\n\nDuring the second part, HT was evaluated and classified on cranial computed tomography and/or MRI post- treatment and was considered as symptomatic HT (sHT) if associated with neurological deterioration.\n\nDuring the third part, the investigators aim to demonstrate the level of biomarkers can significant predict HT and outcomes in stroke patients undergoing revascularization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Biomarker","Mechanical thrombectomy","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Acute Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"endovascular treatment group","interventionNames":["Device: Endovascular treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Endovascular treatment","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy and/or Aspiration","armGroupLabels":["endovascular treatment group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hemorrhagic transformation","description":"Hemorrhagic transformation was diagnosed by Computed tomographic scans usually performed 24 to 72 hours after the procedure.Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as neurologic deterioration (an increase of 4 or more points in the score on the NIHSS) and evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on imaging studies.","timeFrame":"24 to 72 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale","description":"this scale measures functional outcome, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).scores of the modified Rankin scale at 2 years (0 or 1 \\[excel- lent outcome\\], 0 to 2 \\[good outcome, indicating functional independence\\], and 0 to 3 \\[favorable outcome\\]).","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. be 18 or older;\n2. have a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke\n3. a score of 6 or more points on the NIHSS(the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale);\n4. be scheduled to undergo intraarterial (IA) therapy for acute hemispheric stroke;\n5. patients eligible for IV alteplase should receive IV alteplase;\n6.
