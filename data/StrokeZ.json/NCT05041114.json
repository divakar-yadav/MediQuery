The purpose of this research is to evaluate safety and feasibility.\n\nThe MNP is a type of implantable brain computer interface which bypasses dysfunctional motor neurons. The device is designed to restore the transmission of neural signal from the cerebral cortex utilized for neuromuscular control of digital devices, resulting in a successful execution of non-mechanical digital commands."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Disorder","Paralysis","Paralysis; Stroke","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Muscular Dystrophies","Spinal Cord Injury","Stroke, Lacunar","Stroke, Brainstem","Upper Limb Injury","Spinal Muscular Atrophy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single","type":"OTHER","description":"Implantation of motor neuroprosthesis medical device.","interventionNames":["Device: Motor Neuroprosthesis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Motor Neuroprosthesis","description":"Type of implantable brain computer interface","armGroupLabels":["Single"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Treatment related adverse events","timeFrame":"12 months post implant"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
