The first group will start with placebo on days 1-4, daily dose on days 5-14, and following by b.i.d treatment on 15-28 days. This group will also receive a matching placebo in the morning and one Aggrenox capsule in the evening before on days 5-14. It enables to reduce the perception of dipyridamole-associated headache. The second group will receive the placebo twice daily on days 1-4, and medication twice daily for the remaining course. The third group will receive the placebo twice daily for the whole course.\n\nStudy Hypothesis:\n\nNULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES\n\nFrom a subject diary, asking for the most frequent side effects observed in the ESPS2 trial, the cumulative headache (intensity x frequency) per day based on the first three days of treatment period defines the primary endpoint.\n\nI: H0: Median cumulative headache is equal for all treatment groups vs. HA: Median cumulative headache is not equal for all treatment groups\n\nII: H0: Median cumulative headache of low dose regimen?Median cumulative headache of regular dose vs. HA: Median cumulative headache of low dose regimen \\< Median cumulative headache of regular dose\n\nComparison(s):\n\nCompare Aggrenox full dose, reduced dose and placebo"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aggrenox速 modified release capsules"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aggrenox速 modified release capsules matching placebo"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cumulated headache (intensity x frequency) over the first three days of treatment period"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of (1) subjects drop out due to drug related AE and (2) experiencing grade 3 or 4 drug related headache during day 5-14, day 15-21 (reduced dose), day 5-11 (regular dose), day 7, day 28; as well as (3) Number of acetaminophen tablets used."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 20 years old or above.\n2.
