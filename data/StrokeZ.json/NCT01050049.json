A secondary objective is to determine if using CTP/CTA-inclusive hyperacute stroke guidelines improves safety by decreasing symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality in patients who receive rt-PA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Before guidelines implemented"},{"label":"After guidelines implemented"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients presenting to the emergency Signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke: impairment of language, motor function, cognition and/or gaze, vision or neglect.\n* Patients with an NIH Stroke Scale score \\> 4\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age less than 19\n* Patient symptomatic for greater than five hours. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy must be instituted within three hours of symptom onset in order to minimize the risk of Intracerebral or symptomatic hemorrhage; other interventions such as intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy and clot retrieval allow for a six-hour window. One hour is an achievable time for arrival to institution of therapy, therefore a five-hour limit on enrollment allows the greatest number of patients the possibility of therapy.\n* Inability to verify a clear onset of symptoms. As noted, time elapsed since the patient's last known baseline state is correlated to Intracerebral and symptomatic hemorrhage, and therapy is approved only for patients with a clear time of onset.","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute stroke","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Temple University Hospital","city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"19140","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.95233,"lon":-75.16379}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000004630","term":"Emergencies"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7486","name":"Emergencies","asFound":"Emergency","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M8163","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
