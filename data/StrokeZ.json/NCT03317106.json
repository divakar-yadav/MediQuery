Detailed information about scale: Korean Version of the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98(K-DRS-R98) DRS-R98 proved to be a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of delirium severity and distinguish patients with delirium from non-delirious patients including dementia. The scale is composed of two sections. The first section is the severity scale, which consists of 13 items that are scored from 0 to 3 according to a Likert scale that is anchored by descriptions of phe-nomenology. The second section consists of three diagnostic items that are scored from 0 to 2 or 3. These items include temporal onset of symptoms, fluctuation of symptom severity and physical disorder. The total scale is comprised of 16 items. The total score is the sum of the scores for each item and the higher the score, the greater the severity.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All cerebral infarction patients who admit to stroke unit Chungnam National University Hospital.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any patients who refuse to enroll the study.\n* Any patients who admit to Intensive Care Unit(ICU), because ICU is well-known for precipitating delirium.","sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All cerebral infarction patients who admit to stroke unit Chungnam National University Hospital.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jeonglan Kim","affiliation":"Professor","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chungnam National University Hospital","city":"Daejeon","state":"Munhwa-ro 282, Jung-gu","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":36.32139,"lon":127.41972}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000003693","term":"Delirium"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000003221","term":"Confusion"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000019965","term":"Neurocognitive Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6584","name":"Delirium","asFound":"Delirium","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6136","name":"Confusion","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21526","name":"Neurocognitive Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
