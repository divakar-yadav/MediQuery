Examine the feasibility of a home Mirror therapy (MT) program in the NYC metropolitan area;\n2. Evaluate the effectiveness of home MT versus traditional home exercise program; and\n3. Evaluate the superiority of unimanual or bimanual MT intervention protocols for chronic stroke subjects with moderate hand deficits. Subjects from occupational therapy at the Ambulatory Care Center of NYU Langone Center with a diagnosis of cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or stroke will be divided into three (3) groups:\n\n   * Control Group subjects will participate in standard occupational therapy rehabilitation protocol plus a traditional home based exercise program.\n   * Experimental group 1 subjects will participate in standard rehabilitation protocol plus unimanual home based mirror therapy program\n   * Experimental group 2 subjects will participate in standard rehabilitation protocol plus bimanual home based mirror therapy program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA)","Stroke"],"keywords":["Post Stroke Recovery","Mirror Therapy","Unimanual mirror therapy","Bimanual mirror

limb\n* Hearing and vision impairments which may impede subjects participation in the home program\n* Perceptual deficits such as apraxia, neglect, or agnosias as per clinical evaluation which may impede subjects participation in the home program\n* Botox injection in affected arm/hand within 3 months\n* Global aphasia that may interfere with understanding instruction for testing or home
