Cerebral stroke remains the leading cause of disability, with 65% of survivors chronically impaired at 6 months. Gamma synchrony (GS) is a fundamental mechanism of cortical function and can be estimated and modulated in a simple, inexpensive, and reliable way. It has provided valuable and cost-effective guidance in several neuropsychiatric conditions. In previous studies, we developed simple yet robust methods for assessing and manipulating GS and proved its relationship with clinical impairment in preliminary data.\n\nThe aim of the present project is to predict and improve stroke recovery by leveraging cortical mapping and modulation of GS via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a safe and inexpensive technique. The project capitalizes on technology readily available to the Italian national health system.","detailedDescription":"The project will consist of 3 Work Packages (WPs):\n\n* The aim of WP1 is to map the relationship between GS and clinical outcomes with EEG.\n* The aim of WP2 is to translate GS assessment and modulation to bedside.\n* The aim of WP3 is to modulate GS to improve rehabilitation outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["tACS","gamma synchrony"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"real tACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Real tACS will be delivered by applying two conductive electrodes over the left and right central areas, for 30 minutes/day (Monday-to-Friday), for two weeks, with the following parameters: sinewaves at 40Hz, peak-to-peak amplitude=1mA, 3s ramping-up and ramping-down.
