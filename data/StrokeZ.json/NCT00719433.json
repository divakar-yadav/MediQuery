Combined with an audiovisual display, this device allows virtual training of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and therapeutic gaming. A patient-responsive controller enables the assistance of the device only as needed. Chronic stroke patients (\\>6 months post stroke) will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental group will perform task-related intensive therapy with the support of ARMin. Therapists will treat the patients of the control group with standard motor relearning therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis"],"keywords":["stroke","chronic","rehabilitation","robot therapy","arm therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: robot therapy (ARMin)"]},{"label":"2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"robot therapy (ARMin)","description":"therapy of the affected arm with a robot for eight weeks, three times weekly for one hour","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional therapy","description":"physical and occupational therapy of the affected arm for eight weeks, three times weekly for one hour","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale","timeFrame":"four and one weeks prior to intervention, four weeks after intervention started, at the end of intervention(eight weeks), two months and six months follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test, Stroke Impact Scale, Motor Activity Log, modified Ashworth Scale, abnormal joint synergies, active range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, and spatial precision of hand positioning.","timeFrame":"three and one weeks prior to intervention, four weeks after intervention started, at the end of intervention(eight weeks), two months and six months follow-up"},{"measure":"fMRI","description":"in 20 Patients fMRI will be recorded while patients interact with an MR-compatible manipulandum","timeFrame":"before and after 8 weeks therapy, 2-months follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 or more\n* first-ever stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic), verified by brain imaging\n* stroke more than six months prior to the study\n* termination of conventional therapy and stable recovery stage (outpatients)\n* moderate to severe motor impairment of the arm (upper limb portion of FMA score between 8 and 38)\n* ability to sit in a chair without any additional support and without leaning on the back rest\n* written informed consent signed by the subject (or an authorized representative)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Excessive spasticity of the affected arm (mAS ≥ 3)\n* any serious medical or psychiatric illness\n* participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to the start of this study\n* anticipated need for any major surgery during the study\n* women known to be pregnant or lactating\n* Orthopedic, rheumatologic or other disease restricting movements of the paralyzed upper extremity\n* shoulder subluxation (palpatory \\> 2 fingers)\n* diseased or damaged skin at the paralyzed arm\n* inability to communicate effectively with the neurological examiner such that the validity of the patient's data could be compromised\n* cyber sickness\n* pace-maker or other implanted electric devices\n* body weight \\> 120kg\n* serious cognitive deficits and aphasia preventing the performance of the ARMin treatment\n* participation in any therapeutic treatment (\"outside therapy\") performed with the paralyzed arm during the planned study - including baseline and follow up.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Robert Riener, Prof.","affiliation":"Sensory Motor Systems Lab, ETH Zürich","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Armin Curt, Prof.","affiliation":"Balgrist University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Balgrist","city":"Zürich","state":"ZH","zip":"8008","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.36667,"lon":8.54999}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17674069","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Nef T, Mihelj M, Riener R.
