This occurs in up to 17% of TBI patients, and accounts for approximately 20% of symptomatic epilepsies (Annegers, JF. et al, 1998). Typically, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) develops or several weeks but even years after the event. PTE is often chronic and poorly controlled pharmacologically. Although several factors have been attributed to an increased risk of developing PTE (e.g. severity of trauma, type of brain injury, time to the appearance of first seizure), the mechanisms underlying it remain unknown. Similar to TBI, ischemic injuries, most frequently occurring in the elderly population are the main cause of new onset epilepsy in this age group. It is still not known what are the risk factors and mechanisms underlying post-ischemic epilepsy.\n\nUnder normal conditions the central nervous system is protected by the operation of the blood- brain barrier (BBB). Following brain injury (either traumatic or ischemic) the BBB is known to disrupt, leading to focal edema and altered extracellular composition. We have recently established methods for quantitative evaluation of the integrity of the BBB using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Using these methods we are able to identify BBB disruption in patients suffering from various pathologies (Tomkins, O. et al. 2001; Avivi, E. et al. 2004). Such altered permeability may last up to years following the acute event and was found to correlate to areas of abnormal neurological function (Korn, A. et al. 2005)\n\nIn recent work using an animal model, we have shown that following focal disruption of the BBB a focus of epileptiform activity is generated within several days. Such pathological activity remains for several weeks, long after the BBB has retained its former function (Seiffert, E. et al. 2004; Iven, S. et al. 2006). Furthermore, this condition may later lead to anatomical alterations as seen by brain MRI scans, as well as in histological sections. Such animals further suffer from functional deterioration and neuronal degeneration in the disrupted region (Tomkins, O. et al. 2006).\n\nIn this work we will test the hypothesis that BBB disruption following brain injury increases the risk for long-term disability, development of brain dysfunction, epileptic seizures and neuroanatomical alterations. For that we will combine a prospective and retrospective study in patients following cerebral cortical injury (traumatic, hemorrhagic or ischemic). Clinical, functional and anatomical measures will be obtained in addition to BBB permeability measures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Blood-brain barrier","Post traumatic epilepsy","Seizures"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"DEFINED_POPULATION","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* One week following:\n\n  * Traumatic Brain Injury\n  * Cerebro- Vascular Accident\n* Subsequent brain CT showed cerebral cortex injury.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A known ailment of the central nervous system.\n* Use of medications or illicit drugs that significantly affect the central nervous system.\n* tourist or temporary residents not available for follow-up.\n* For MRI examinations: heart pacemaker, metal implants, or metal shrapnel.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Alon Friedman, MD/PhD","role":"CONTACT","email":"alonf@bgu.ac.il"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Alon Friedman, MD/PhD","affiliation":"Soroka University Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Ilan Shelef, MD","affiliation":"Soroka University Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Soroka University Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beer Sheva","country":"Israel","contacts":[{"name":"Alon Friedman, MD/PhD","role":"CONTACT","email":"alonf@bgu.ac.il"},{"name":"Alon Friedman, MD/PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":31.25181,"lon":34.7913}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17188501","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Tomkins O, Friedman O, Ivens S, Reiffurth C, Major S, Dreier JP, Heinemann U, Friedman A.
