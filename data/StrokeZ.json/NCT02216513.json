Autoregulation will be assessed from the phase and gain of the transfer function. Phase shift reflects the temporal difference between cerebral flow velocity fluctuations with respect to arterial pressure fluctuations. When the fluctuations of both flow and pressure are almost synchronous, the phase shift approaches zero, reflecting impaired cerebral autoregulation. Transfer function gain reflects the magnitude of transmission of arterial pressure fluctuations to cerebral blood flow velocity fluctuations. Lower gain, particularly in the low frequency (\\< 0.1 Hz) range, is reflective of more effective cerebral autoregulation. Coherence reflects the degree of linear dependence between pressure and flow fluctuations. Thus, it provides a measure of validity of the metrics (gain and phase) derived from the linear transfer function.","timeFrame":"5 days after initiation of study drug"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosis of spontaneous SAH\n* impaired cerebral autoregulation on day 2-4 post SAH\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* traumatic SAH\n* other central neurological disorders such as tumors, known prior stroke, hemorrhage or vascular malformations\n* pregnancy\n* severe renal disease or anuria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Farzaneh A Sorond, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02115","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33236783","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Van der Loo LE, Aquarius R, Teernstra O, Klijn K, Menovsky T, van Dijk JMC, Bartels R, Boogaarts HD.
