The acute ischemic stroke patients undergone endovascular therapy will be enrolled in stroke centers. Baseline information and clinical follow-up information at 90 days of stroke onset are collected. Data collected include demographics, comorbidities, pathogenesis, blood pressures, stroke severity on admission, time intervals, reperfusion condition, and functional outcome, et al. The study aims to investigate the real situation of assessment, diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients with endovascular therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endovascular Treatment"],"keywords":["acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days","description":"The range of the modified Rankin Scale is from 0 to 6.
