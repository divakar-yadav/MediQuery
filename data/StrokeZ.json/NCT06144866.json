Our previous investigation reported under the fixed dose regimen, dabigatran exposure increased in elderly, renal impairments and patients with multiple co-morbid conditions. Our data also showed difference in NOACs exposure in Asians. For example, patients under rivaroxaban, in comparison to apxiaban, were more likely to have lower than expected range drug level.

Prospectively record the NOACs concentration among AF patients under NOACs therapy and suffered from ischemic stroke (IS), transient ischemic attack (TIA), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and other major bleeding.\n2.

Prospectively record the NOACs concentration among AF patients under NOACs therapy and suffered from IS, TIA, ICH or major bleeding.\n\n   AF patients who presented to emergent department (ED) for acute IS, TIA, ICH (non-traumatic), or other major bleeding and was under NOACs therapy will be recruited to this study. Blood sample will be collected before acute management to measure NOACs concentration. Co-morbid disease, laboratory tests and concurrent medications will be retrieved from electronic medical records. The onset, location, severity of IS. ICH or other major bleeding, and the outcome and long-term managements will be prospectively recorded.\n2. Investigate the correlation between NOACs concentration and thromboembolic or bleeding events.\n\n   For each NOACs, we are going to compare the differences in NOACs exposure between patients with thromboembolism or major bleedi. Important baseline characteristics, co-medications and disease severity will be adjusted before making comparison.\n3. Propose a therapeutic range for NOACs, in order to provide a guide for important decision in acute setting.\n\nFrom the data of NOACs concentration among patients with IS or ICH, we plan to propose a therapeutic range with acceptable efficacy and safety for NOACs therapy. Our data will provide a guide for physicians to make important clinical decision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Anticoagulant Adverse Reaction"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Intracranial hemorrhage","Direct oral anticoagulant","Drug level"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"plasma, buffycoat"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban","description":"For patients who received direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) before ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, the DOAC level upon hospital arrival will be measured.","otherNames":["Direct oral anticoagulants"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Functional status measured by using the modified Rankin Scale.","timeFrame":"3 months after stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"Type 2 parenchymal hemorrhage on the follow-up neuroimage in 24 to 36 hours after EVT, with neurological deterioration of ≥4 points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score from baseline","timeFrame":"24-36 hours after stroke"},{"measure":"Early neurological improvement","description":"Reduction of 8 points or more in the NIHSS score within 24 hours.","timeFrame":"24 hours after stroke"},{"measure":"Successful reperfusion (in ischemic stroke patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy)","description":"Defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale 2b to 3","timeFrame":"Evaluated after EVT"},{"measure":"Recurrent ischemic stroke","description":"Neurological symptoms with ischemic lesion noted on neuroimaging","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Recurrent intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Neurological symptoms with hemorrhagic lesion noted on neuroimaging","timeFrame":"3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
