Virtual environment provide useful way to explore planning and secondly to examine the effectiveness of using VR in the assessment of cognitive planning for patients. A virtual supermarket was designed in which participants carried out a task close to daily activities: a test of shopping list. Of the 70 subjects (7 centres), 35 randomly allocated to the control group, and the other 35 subjects randomly allocated to the experimental group. Subjects will be evaluated by a therapist who will not be involved in the training program and did not know about the subject's group assignment.\n\nStatistical analysis : We will calculate descriptive statistics for the clinical characteristics of each group. We will use to compare the baseline demographic characteristics, the pretraining and posttraining variables between groups, independent-samples t-tests for means and Chi-square tests for frequencies. A significance level of 0.05 is set for all analyses."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual reality-based cognitive training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Cognitive rehabilitation (without extra computer training)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation","description":"The experimental group patients receive rehabilitation by training \"Virtual Action Planning - Supermarket\" on a computer 45 minutes 5 times a week during a 2-week period.
