Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are 200 times more likely to have cerebrovascular disease than normal children and are known to have an altered immune response to many infectious pathogens. C. pneumoniae is the leading infectious cause of acute chest syndrome which, interestingly, is a well- established risk factor for stroke in children with SCA. Preliminary data indicates that SCA patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-documented cerebral infarction are 12 times more likely to have C. pneumoniae infection than SCA patients with normal MRI scans. The investigators hypothesize that SCA patients have an abnormal immune response to C. pneumoniae that results in persistent infection which, in turn, triggers the development of cerebrovascular disease. Sickle cell anemia patients with an elevated velocity on transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) are known to be at high risk to develop stroke and an elevated TCD likely reflects underlying vascular disease. In addition, the Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia Trial (STOP) demonstrated that almost 40 percent of children with an elevated TCD have evidence of cerebral infarction on MRI. Children with abnormal TCDs are, therefore, an appropriate population to investigate an association between cerebrovascular disease and C. pneumoniae infection.\n\nThe study is in response to an initiative on Ancillary Studies in Heart, Lung, and Blood Disease Trials released in June, 2000.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nThe study is ancillary to the STOP II clinical trial. The intent is: 1) To determine if C. pneumoniae infection is associated with cerebral infarction in children with SCA; 2) To characterize the immunological response to C. pneumoniae infection in patients with SCA. Establishing a link between C.pneumoniae infection and cerebral infarction will open the door to novel, less toxic approaches to the treatment and prevention of stroke in SCA, including antibiotics and vaccines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Blood Disease","Anemia, Sickle Cell","Chlamydia Infections","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"No eligibility criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Lori Styles","affiliation":"UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002690","term":"Chlamydia Infections"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000000740","term":"Anemia"},{"id":"D000000755","term":"Anemia, Sickle Cell"},{"id":"D000006402","term":"Hematologic Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002694","term":"Chlamydiaceae Infections"},{"id":"D000016905","term":"Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections"},{"id":"D000001424","term":"Bacterial Infections"},{"id":"D000001423","term":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses"},{"id":"D000007239","term":"Infections"},{"id":"D000015231","term":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial"},{"id":"D000012749","term":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases"},{"id":"D000003141","term":"Communicable Diseases"},{"id":"D000091662","term":"Genital Diseases"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000000745","term":"Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital"},{"id":"D000000743","term":"Anemia, Hemolytic"},{"id":"D000006453","term":"Hemoglobinopathies"},{"id":"D000030342","term":"Genetic Diseases, Inborn"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9973","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6058","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3760","name":"Anemia","asFound":"Anemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3775","name":"Anemia, Sickle Cell","asFound":"Anemia, Sickle Cell","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5624","name":"Chlamydia Infections","asFound":"Chlamydia Infections","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9180","name":"Hematologic Diseases","asFound":"Blood Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4412","name":"Bacterial Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18939","name":"Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11826","name":"Mycoses","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4411","name":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15248","name":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17625","name":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2877","name":"Genital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2876","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3763","name":"Anemia, Hemolytic","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9237","name":"Hemolysis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3765","name":"Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9229","name":"Hemoglobinopathies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M23376","name":"Genetic Diseases, Inborn","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T5229","name":"Sickle Cell Anemia","asFound":"Anemia, Sickle Cell","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC15","name":"Blood and Lymph Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
