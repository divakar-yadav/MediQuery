After stroke excursion of the diaphragm reduces about 50%, and also the maximum expiratory pressure of the individual 50% or higher. Dysphagia occurs in 29% to 45% of the acute stroke cases.","detailedDescription":"As a third leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability, stroke still maintain its bad reputation in worldwide. Stroke owes its fame on wide range of symptoms mostly the musculoskeletal system symptoms such as spasticity, equilibrium and gait problems. Although mentioned symptoms keep their popularity devious two dysfunction caused by stroke; stomatognathic system dysfunction and respiratory dysfunction appears to change this equation. Considering the high incidence of dysphagia and the reduced cardiopulmonary capacity of the stroke patients, it seems inevitable. From this perspective aim of this study is to assess the effect of expiratory muscle training on the stomatognathic system in patients with stroke and as mentioned aid to shatter the mentioned equation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Mastication Disorder","Temporomandibular Disorders","Dysphagia","Stomatognathic Diseases"],"keywords":["Stroke","Mastication","Dysphagia","Temporomandibular joint"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups as an intervention and control.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome measures will be performed by an another investigator.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":146,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Expiratory muscle training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Daily expiratory muscle training for four weeks will be applied.","interventionNames":["Other: Expiratory muscle training"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Nothing will be applied except for the hospital conventional physiotherapy program."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Expiratory muscle training","description":"For training group first maximum expiratory pressure measurement will be assessed with portable expiratory measurement device.
