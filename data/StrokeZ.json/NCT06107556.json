The dissociated analysis of these mechanisms and their interactions during multi-segmental movements and especially during walking is poorly described. However, a quantified assessment of the responsibility of each of the neuromuscular mechanisms in the functional disorder would guide the choice of treatments. 3D gait laboratories provide kinematic data from synchronized walking to surface electromyograms as part of additional assessments to assist in the follow-up of patients with chronic hemiparesis. Retrospective analysis of these data would help to better characterize muscular activation disorders and passive resistance to movement during walking in this population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Walking, Difficulty","Spasticity/Paresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Gait analysis","description":"3D gait analysis with electromyographic measurements"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Coefficient of antagonist activation","description":"The coefficient of antagonist activation of gastrocnemius medialis and soleus was calculated from EMG data by the ratio between the root mean square amplitude during antagonist effort and maximal agonist effort for the same muscle.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult\n* Person who performed tridimensional gait analysis in laboratory\n* Person who had a stroke at least 6 months before the gait analysis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any other neurological pathology or gait disorders\n* Botulinum toxin injection in the last 3 months before the gait analysis","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Person with a history of stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Emilie Hutin, Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0149812549","email":"emilie.hutin@aphp.fr"},{"name":"Emilie Hutin","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0149812549","email":"emilie.hutin@aphp.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Emilie Hutin","affiliation":"Hôpitaux Universitaires Henri Mondor","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Laboratoire Analyse et Restauration du Mouvement","city":"Créteil","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.78333,"lon":2.46667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"},{"id":"D000020196","term":"Trauma, Nervous System"},{"id":"D000051346","term":"Mobility Limitation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Paresis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21713","name":"Trauma, Nervous System","asFound":"Nervous System Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26379","name":"Mobility Limitation","asFound":"Walking, Difficulty","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"}]}},"hasResults":false}
