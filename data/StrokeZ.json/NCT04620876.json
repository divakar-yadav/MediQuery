However, optical aberrations of the ocular media limit the resolution that can be achieved by current techniques.\n\nThe use of an adaptive optics system improves the resolution of ophthalmoscopes by several orders of magnitude, allowing the visualization of many retinal microstructures: photoreceptors, vessels, bundles of nerve fibers.\n\nRecently, the development of the coupling of the two main imaging techniques, the Adaptive Optics Ophthalmoscope with Optical Coherence Tomography, enables unparalleled three-dimensional in vivo cell-scale imaging, while remaining comfortable for the patients.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of this system for imaging micrometric retinal structures.","detailedDescription":"The goal of the project is the capture and analysis of images with AOSLO system, in order to evaluate the performance of this system compared to OCT imaging devices and existing Adaptive Optics used at National Hospital of Ophthalmology."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinitis Pigmentosa","Maculopathy, Age Related","Macular Dystrophy","Macular Edema","Retinal Detachment","Retinal Degeneration","Glaucoma","Vascular Inflammation","Hypertension","Stroke","Diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bimodal and coaxial high resolution imaging of the retina","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Optical coherence tomography and Scanning laser ophthalmoscope system using adaptive optics (AO-SLO-OCT)","interventionNames":["Other: Bimodal high resolution imaging of the retina"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bimodal high resolution imaging of the retina","description":"The protocol consists of performing an Optical coherence tomography and Scanning laser ophthalmoscope system using adaptive optics (AO-SLO-OCT).The participant is asked to put his forehead against the temple supports and his chin on a chin rest. The subject will be asked to fix a test pattern in the form of a cross. The pattern is positioned according to the desired eccentricity with respect to the fovea. The actual acquisition lasts a few seconds, possibly repeated to cover the field of the desired eye. The acquisition protocol depends on the subjects, their pathology and the system used; the area examined will be modified on a case by case basis.
