Prehospital providers need tools to help triage large vessel stroke patients to comprehensive stroke centers. This device will identify large vessel stroke to ultimately improve triage decisions and optimize outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Patients suspected of stroke by a prehospital provider will have a headset placed to record their headpulse during the encounter. These measurements will be used to assess the accuracy of the device at predicting the presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke.
