We will use EEG, structural MRI, and resting-state functional connectivity MRI to assess neuronal responses in 28 healthy subjects to a) strong manual needle-stimulation of the acupuncture points DU26, PC6 and SP6 (XNKQ acupuncture), b) insertion of needles on the acupuncture points DU26, PC6 and SP6 without stimulation (control 1), c) strong manual needle stimulation of three non-acupuncture points (control 2), and d) insertion of needles on three non-acupuncture points without stimulation (control 3). With this, our study aims to create results which inform future studies in patients and might be helpful for the rehabilitation of deficits after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"healthy subjects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"they receive XNKQ acupuncture, as well as control 1, control 2, and control 3 in a randomized order.","interventionNames":["Other: XNKQ","Other: Control 1","Other: Control 2","Other: Control 3"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"XNKQ","description":"stimulation at 5 acupuncture points according to XNKQ acupuncture","armGroupLabels":["healthy subjects"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control 1","description":"no stimulation at 5 acupuncture points according to XNKQ acupuncture","armGroupLabels":["healthy subjects"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control 2","description":"stimulation at 5 control points","armGroupLabels":["healthy subjects"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control 3","description":"no stimulation at 5 control points","armGroupLabels":["healthy subjects"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in brain background rhythms (mu-alpha and beta activity) [assessed using EEG and MRI] after one intervention (baseline vs. post stimulation) in comparison between the four different interventions.","timeFrame":"60 minutes"},{"measure":"Changes in resting state functional connectivity [assessed using EEG and MRI] after one intervention (baseline vs. post-stimulation) in comparison between the four different interventions","timeFrame":"60 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy subjects (18 to 40 years of age) health status confirmed by a comprehensive neurological examination\n* Right-handed (evaluated by \"the Edinburgh inventory\")\n* Informed consent\n* No acupuncture treatment in the last 12 months\n* No medical knowledge about acupuncture\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of neurological and/or psychiatric diseases\n* History of brain injury\n* Cognitive handicap and severe speech disorder\n* alcohol or drug abuse\n* History of neurosurgical intervention\n* Chronic disease (e.g., asthma, diabetes mellitus etc.) with regular use of medications\n* Usage of acute medication\n* Pregnancy (tested by urine pregnancy test before the measurement) or planned pregnancy\n* Any contraindication for acupuncture (e.g., anti-coagulation therapy)\n* Any exclusion criteria for MRI scanning (metal implants (e.g. pacemaker), claustrophobia, etc.)\n* Participation in another interventional trial.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Claudia M.
