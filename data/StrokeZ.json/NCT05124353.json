It was shown that combining early reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy) with stroke unit care and immediate rehabilitation have beneficial effects on the patient recovery and outcomes.

Cerebrolysin will be administered immediately after randomization or at the latest during the EVT procedure and will be continued for 10 days. After the EVT all patients, depending on their clinical condition, will be hospitalized in ICU (intensive care unit) or Neurology Department, where standard treatment and monitoring will be implemented, as well as standard rehabilitation. Outcome assessments will include: the NIH Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Score, pre MRS, IQ code, Geriatric Depression Scales, MoCA. Additionally, the infarct volume of the control CT will be measured. The follow up should be performed on day 7( or discharge), 1 month, 3 months, 6 months.

In proposed project we evaluate the impact of the combination of early reperfusion therapy (thrombectomy) with early neuroproptective drug administration on treatment results in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Cerebrolysin, which has been shown to have neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in vitro and in vivo, when administered early in combination with early endovascular therapy may have a positive effect on the prognosis and treatment outcomes of these patients. The proposed study, is approved by the Pomeranian Medical University Bioethics Committee in Szczecin, Poland, will be also part of the international CERECAP project investigating the co-application of neuroprotective and reperfusion therapies (thrombolysis, thrombectomy) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\nPurpose of the project:\n\nexamining the impact of early cerebrolysin supply on the treatment effect in patients with diagnosed acute ischemic stroke, qualified for endovascular treatment in the form of thrombectomy\n\nHypothesis:\n\nCerebrolysin in early (up do 6 h) administration with combination of early (up to 6h) endovascular therapy (thrombectomy) is beneficial for the patients with acute ischemic stroke diagnosis.\n\nMaterial and method 100 patients will be qualified for the proposed project. Study duration: 24 months.\n\nInclusion criteria for the study diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke qualification for endovascular treatment in the form of thrombectomy\n\nCriteria for exclusion from the study:\n\nPatient qualified for thrombolysis Patients under 18 years of age pregnancy Kidney failure Epilepsy History of allergy to cerebrolysin\n\nStudy design:\n\nAfter prior randomization to the group, patients will be divided into group G1 (cerebrolysin supply) and group G2 (standard treatment, without cerebrolysin supply).\n\nIn group G1, cerebrolysin will be administered immediately after qualifying for the study (i.e. up to 6 hours after the onset of symptoms) and continued for the next 10 days at a dose of 30 ml i.v.\n\nPatients from both groups G1 and G2 will undergo thrombectomy treatment, and then, depending on the clinical condition, hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit or the Department of Neurology with the Stroke Department.\n\nDuring the hospitalization, the standard and typical care for both departments will be continued.\n\nTreatment results will be assessed using:\n\nNIH, Modified Rankin Scale, preMRS, IQ code, Geriatric Depression Scale and MoCA.\n\nRoutine checkups for computed tomography will also undergo analysis for treatment evaluation (e.g. stroke volume). Patients' condition will be assessed after 1, 3 and 6 months.\n\nThe results obtained in this way will be statistically analyzed and presented in the form of articles in medical journals.\n\nExpected benefits:\n\n* examination of the influence of early cerebrolysin supply on the treatment effect in patients undergoing thrombectomy after acute ischemic stroke diagnosis\n* development of the cerebrolysin supply protocol in patients with acute ischemic stroke diagnosis"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute, Ischemic"],"keywords":["acute.stroke","ischemic stroke","neuroprotection","treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"G1 : Treatment Group (TG)r","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in TG receive neuroprotective drug: standard dose of Cerebrolysin 30ml i.v. in the first 6 hours after first symptoms.
