A history of stroke is the strongest predictor of a future stroke. Control of risk factors lowers the risk of future stroke, yet most persons with stroke do not have their risk factors controlled.\n\nIn this randomized-controlled trial, we will test whether an outpatient stroke prevention program consisting of group clinics, patient self-management, and telephone care coordination can lower the risk of recurrent stroke by improving patient knowledge, medication adherence, and lifestyle habits. If successful, this program may be adapted to other settings."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["chronic care model","stroke prevention","health services research"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Prevention Program + Usual Care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke Prevention Care Program + Usual Care.
