These disorders of spatial cognition are manifested by a distortion of the mental representation of space and body in space that probably cause a deviation of the position of the center of pression on platform. This component of balance disorders secondary to disruption of spatial cognition, do not benefit at present from specific rehabilitative treatment despite the severity of the consequences.\n\nBut the application of sensory manipulations has proven its effectiveness on visuospatial neglect that is another disorder of spatial cognition closed to the pathophysiology of balance disorders after right brain lesion. Sensory manipulations decrease the distortion of internal representations of the body in space by restoring the symmetry of sensory inputs. Some of these manipulations (visual manipulation by wearing prisms and proprioceptive manipulations) are also effective on the immediate correction of postural imbalances on force platform and disorders of spatial perception.\n\nWe therefore believe that the approach by repeated sensory manipulation is a new promising way of research for the rehabilitative treatment of balance disorders secondary to disorders of spatial cognition. As the mechanisms of action and the structures involved during proprioceptive vibration of neck muscles and during visual prism adaptation are different, we believe that the combination of these two types of sensory manipulations will permit to obtain a greater and longer lasting effect than a lonely manipulation. The concomitant evaluation of the bias on postural platform and the perception of the body axis will allow us to assess the impact of such rehabilitation on the disorders of spatial representation and so better understand the mechanisms of action of sensory manipulations.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program with cervical vibration (V) and / or prism adaptation (P) in patients with left hemiplegia on balance at the end of the intervention (day14).\n\nSecondary objectives are to test:\n\n* The immediate effect (day 0) on force platform evaluation of balance,\n* Maintaining the gain at 3 months and 6 months on balance,\n* Effectiveness at day 14 on negligence\n* Maintaining the gain at 3 months and 6 months on neglect,\n* Effectiveness at day 14 on functional abilities,\n* Maintaining the gain at 3 months and 6 months on functional abilities,\n* Understanding the mechanisms of action of each of the sensory manipulations by assessing changes in perceptions of space, after rehabilitation programs (day 14) and at 3 months and 6 months.\n* To evaluate the evolution of motility, sensitivity and spasticity in the various assessments.\n\nDuring the 15 days rehabilitation performed for the study, the upper and lower limbs motor rehabilitation will last less than one hour and a half, and will exclude instrumental techniques of balance rehabilitation, sensory manipulations, virtual reality, strain-induced therapy.\n\nMoreover, an ancillary study will be performed to study the immediate neurofunctional effect of vibratory stimulation, in right brain-damaged patients with imbalance and in healthy volunteers, through the assessment of cerebral activation changes in MRI. The secondary objectives of this ancillary study are to test the neurofunctional effect of repeated vibratory stimulation in right brain-damaged patients, describe the relationship between cerebral activation changes and evolution of balance, and describe the areas of the brain activated by vibratory stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Left-sided Hemiplegia Affecting Dominant Side as Late Effect of Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Balance,Hemiplegia,Cervical vibration,Prism adaptation,Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":114,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will benefit from conventional rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Cervical vibration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will benefit from a daily 20 minutes session, with vibration of neck muscles during 10 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Cervical vibration"]},{"label":"Prism adaptation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will benefit from a daily 20 minutes session, with prism adaptation during 10 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Prism adaptation"]},{"label":"Cervical vibration + Prism adaptation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive a daily 30 minutes session, with cervical vibration during 10 minutes + prism adaptation during 10 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Cervical vibration","Other: Prism adaptation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cervical vibration","description":"Vibration of neck muscles during 10 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Cervical vibration","Cervical vibration + Prism adaptation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Prism adaptation","description":"Prism adaptation during 10 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Cervical vibration + Prism adaptation","Prism adaptation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional rehabilitation","description":"conventional rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome is the deviation of the mean position of center of pressure (CP) (eyes closed) on the mediolateral axis (mm) assessed by posturography after intervention.","timeFrame":"Day 14"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of balance","description":"* Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke\n* Scale for Contraversive Pushing\n* Berg Balance Scale\n* Timed Up and Go\n* Measurement performed on the platform of strength:\n\n  * surface of the center of mass displacement\n  * deviation of the mean position of the center pressure on the anteroposterior axis\n  * standard deviation of the average displacement of the center pressure on the mediolateral axis and the anteroposterior axis,\n  * percentage of support on the hemiplegic lower limb.","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 14, Month 3, Month 6"},{"measure":"Evaluation of functional capacity","description":"* Barthel Index (Day 0, Day 14, Month 3, Month 6)\n* Number of hours of help at home (Month 3, Month 6)\n* Total Duration of hospitalization since the Cerebral Vascular Accident (Month 3, Month 6)","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 14, Month 3, Month 6"},{"measure":"Evaluation of negligence","description":"* Bell test,\n* Bisection test,\n* Scale of Catherine Bergego,\n* OTA test\n* Test of bodily neglect.","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 14, Month 3, Month 6"},{"measure":"Understanding the mechanisms of sensory manipulations","description":"* Evaluation of longitudinal axis by a fluorescent bar movement in front of the patient through a computerized system.\n* Haptic Straight Ahead using a graduated table on which the subject moves his hand blindfolded.","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 14, Month 3, Month 6"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time since stroke","timeFrame":"day 0"},{"measure":"Extent of the injury and localization of brain injury","description":"Assessed by morphological MRI with DT1, TSE T2 and flair sequences, to achieve a morphological analysis of the lesion.
