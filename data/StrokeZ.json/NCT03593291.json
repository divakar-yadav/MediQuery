This strategy has several shortcomings.\n\nThe current study was there for devised to examine in vivo activity of LMWH in patients receiving a fixed dose prophylactic regimen, in order to assess the effectiveness of this method.\n\nPurpose To perform an exploratory prospective analysis of longitudinal data sets to assess anti-factor Xa levels in a cohort of patients recovering from acute ischemic stroke and receiving prophylactic-dose LMWH for VTE prevention.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measures:\n\n1. assess anti-factor Xa levels\n2. adverse events related to thrombosis\n3. adverse event related to hemorrhage\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n\nPatient demographic data Patient anthropometric data Adverse events/weekly (falls, infections, VTE, stress ulcer...) Eligibility\n\nAges Eligible for Study: 40 Years to 80 Years (Adult, Senior) Gender Eligible for Study: All Accepts Healthy Volunteers: No Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample Study Population Patients hospitalized for rehabilitation following acute ischemic stroke\n\nMethods:\n\nClinical decision to administer LMWH prophylactic treatment will be made in line with standard clinical practice and in accordance to the criteria described above.\n\nSearch for patients diagnosed with sub-acute stroke and receiving LMWH treatment will be performed on the digital database of the Loewenstien rehabilitation hospital Rannana, Israel.\n\nPatients receiving LMWH prophylaxis with fixed dose regimen will be recruited flowing signing of consent form.\n\nFlowing at least 7 consecutive days of treatment blood sample will be drown 3-4 hours post LMWH administration and sent for The anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) assay. In the event of high or low results the Hematological consult will be contacted for decision about dose adjustment or other intervention/investigation.\n\nAll data will be drawn from patient's electronic/hardcopy files. patient characteristics (age, gender, , past medical history), Stroke characteristics (type, location, NIHSS), days from stroke onset to rehabilitation admission, along with each patient's length of stay, neurological impairments, and Rehabilitation outcomes. Trained research associates, who are familiar with the process of chart review, will extract the information from the charts using the form provided.\n\nStatistical analysis: multi variant combative analysis of outcome measures will be carried out to compare study and control groups.\n\nEstimated Enrollment: 100 patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, VTE prophylaxis, Anti Xa"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Anti Xa","description":"Levels of Anti Xa measure"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Anti-Xa level","description":"Flowing at least 7 consecutive days of treatment blood sample will be drown 3-4 hours post LMWH administration and sent for The anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) assay.","timeFrame":"3-4 hours post LMWH administration"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute Ischemic stroke per imaging study\n* Clinical decision to administer VTE prophylaxis.
