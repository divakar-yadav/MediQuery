The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Evaluating the impact of normobaric high-concentration oxygen versus low-concentration oxygen on early neurological function after EVT.\n* Evaluating the safety of high and low normobaric oxygen concentration in patients with ischemic stroke.\n\nParticipants will (1) receive EVT under general anesthesia; (2) be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive oxygen therapy with FiO2=80% or FiO2=30% through endotracheal intubation during the operation, and the gas flow rate was set at 1.5L /min.","detailedDescription":"The optimal fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) during EVT under general anesthesia is currently uncertain. This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the impact of normobaric high-concentration oxygen versus low-concentration oxygen on early neurological function following EVT. It is a prospective, open-label, parallel-design RCT planned to be conducted at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University. It is anticipated that 200 cases of AIS patients undergoing EVT under general anesthesia will be consecutively enrolled from 2024 to 2026. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. After general anesthesia induction, patients will receive continuous inhalation of oxygen with either FiO2=80% or FiO2=30% through endotracheal intubation until the end of the procedure, with a gas flow rate set at 1.5 L/min. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of early neurological improvement (NIHSS score of 10 points 24±2 hours after stroke onset). Safety outcomes include potential adverse events such as site infection, three-month mortality, etc."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Endovascular therapy","Acute ischemic stroke","Normobaric hyperoxia","Early neurological improvement","General anesthesia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normobaric high-concentration oxygen (NBHO) group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After preoxygenating (FiO2=100%, 6 L/min) with a face mask for 3 min, patients will be sequentially administered intravenous sufentanil 0.2 µg/kg followed by propofol 2 mg/kg.
