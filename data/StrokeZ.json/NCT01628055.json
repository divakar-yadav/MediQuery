Even more striking is the absence of stroke in IVIG-treated PID patients over 65, while in the same general population age group the stroke prevalence goes up to 8.1%. This suggests that the degree of stroke protection correlates with the length of IVIG treatment, since older PID patients have been treated with IVIG significantly longer than younger ones.","detailedDescription":"Two pre-clinical studies demonstrated the effectiveness of IVIG preparations in improving the clinical outcome of stroke and at the same time provided evidence of the role of complement fragments in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced brain damage. Scavenging of these active fragments by IVIG is the likely mechanism of beneficial effect. In one of these studies CSL's own Privigen preparation was used. Considering that it exhibited in-vitro scavenging abilities more pronounced than several other IVIG preparations, and that its in-vivo scavenging capacity was also proven in a relevant animal model, a need to test this preparation in stroke patients is warranted. In addition, activation of complement and the level of activated fragments in humans seem to correlate with the severity of the disease, making them an ideal therapeutic target."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["IVIg","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Stroke","CVA","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Privigen","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The IVIG preparation to be used is 10% liquid (Privigen).
