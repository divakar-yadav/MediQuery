The safety of the cinepazide, especially the blood system, has not been fully evaluated in Chinese population. In order to improve the rational use of cinepazide, the investigators observe its clinical use in the real world in China, evaluate its safety and clinical benefit in a large Chinese population.","detailedDescription":"Cinepazide was firstly approved in France in 1974, and the formulations are injection and tablet. Products containing cinepazide have been withdrawn in 1990s by the manufacturers because of lacking of demonstrated efficacy and the risk of agranulocytosis in some European countries, such as France, Spain, Italy. In some Aisa countries, it has not been re-registered in Japan in 2000s, and the injection is still used in China and Korea. In china, Cinepazide Maleate Injection was approved by China Food and Drug Administration(CFDA) in 2002, and widely used in cerebrovascular disease. The safety of the Cinepazide, especially the adverse drug reactions in the blood system, has not benn fully evaluated in Chinese population. In this study, clinical pharmacists in selected hospitals will record the clinical use and the adverse drug reactions/ adverse drug events of this injection. This real world study for Cinepazide Maleate Injection with 18000 patients will be conducted from Sep. 2012 to June. 2014."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Adverse Drug
