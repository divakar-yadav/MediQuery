Inflammatory hormones, known as cytokines, are stimulated by an activated immune system and sometimes become active following a stroke. They may be responsible for altering levels of key neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the blood and brain of stroke patients. The investigators' objective is to examine whether increased cytokine activity following a stroke may be the cause of an increased presence or severity of depression or cognitive impairment among stroke patients, as a result of tryptophan depletion and/or kynurenine activation. They are recruiting patients within one month of their strokes and measuring levels of key markers in their blood. Patients are assessed for the presence of depressive and/or cognitive symptoms and treated with an antidepressant if needed. The investigators expect to show that cytokine activation is related to depression and/or cognitive impairment among stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression"],"keywords":["stroke","depression","cytokines","serotonin","citalopram"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":138,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Citalopram","description":"Patients who are found to have major depression will be referred to a psychologist","otherNames":["Celexa"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"NINCDS-CSN Vascular Cognitive Impairment Battery","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"NIH Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Gender: male or female\n* Language: speaks and understands English\n* Clinical diagnosis of stroke according to World Health Organization MONICA Project and recent (\\< 3 months) cerebral infarctions\n* Written, informed consent\n* Depressed group only: diagnosis of a major depressive episode according to the depression module of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-IV)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n* Intracranial hemorrhage\n* Significant acute medical illness including: drug overdose, severely disturbed liver, kidney or lung function, anemia, hypothyroidism, or uncontrolled diabetes\n* Significant acute neurologic illness including: impaired consciousness, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, progressive supranuclear paralysis, brain tumor, subdural hematoma, multiple sclerosis, hydrocephalus, Binswanger's disease, or severe aphasia\n* Presence of a premorbid Axis I psychiatric diagnosis (eg. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder)\n* Depressed group only: contraindications to receiving treatment with citalopram (including previous nonresponse) or serious risk of suicide","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Krista L Lanctot, PhD","affiliation":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"York Central Hospital","city":"Richmond Hill","state":"Ontario","zip":"L4C 4Z3","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.87111,"lon":-79.43725}},{"facility":"St. John's Rehabilitation Hospital","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M2M 2G1","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"Toronto Rehabilitation Institute","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M4G 1R7","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M4N 3M5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"Baycrest","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M6A 2E1","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25285006","type":"RESULT","citation":"Bensimon K, Herrmann N, Swardfager W, Yi H, Black SE, Gao FQ, Snaiderman A, Lanctot KL.
