Available treatments are intensive and week- or month-long. Transcranial Direct current stimulation (tDCS), a plasticity-modulating non-invasive technique, could be combined with behavioral trainings to boost their efficacy or reduce treatment duration. Some promising attempts have been made pairing occipital tDCS with visual restitution training, however less is knows about which area/network should be best stimulated in association with compensatory approaches, aimed at improving exploratory abilities, such as multisensory trainings.\n\nIn the present double-blind, sham-controlled study, we assess the efficacy of a multisensory training combined with tDCS. 3 groups of participants with chronic HVFDs underwent a 10-day (1.5 hrs/day) compensatory audio-visual training combined with either real anodal tDCS applied to the ipsilesional occipital tDCS (Group 1), or the ipsilesional posterior parietal cortex (Group 2), or a sham, placebo, tDCS (Group 3).\n\nThe training require the participants to orient their gaze training spatio-temporally congruent, cross-modal, audio-visual stimuli (starting from a central fixation) and press a button as quick as possible upon the detection of the visual stimulus. All stimuli are presented on 2mx2m panel embedded with 48 LEDs and loudspeakers (Bolognini et al., 2010, Brain Research)\n\nAll participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment of visuospatial functions prior to the beginning of the training (t0), at the end of the training (t1), and at 1-month (t2) and 4-month follow-up (t3). The assessment includes: a visual detection task, three visual search tasks (EF, Triangles, and Numbers; Bolognini et al., 2005, Brain), and a questionnaire about functional impact of the HVFDs in the activities of daily living."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemianopsia, Homonymous"],"keywords":["Homonymous Visual Field Defects","Hemianopia","Compensatory training","Audio-visual multisensory training","tDCS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Three groups of participants were allocated to three different experimental treatments:\n\nGroup 1: audio-visual training + ipsilesional occipital tDCS Group 2: audio-visual training + ipsilesional posterior parietal tDCS Group 3: audio-visual training + sham, placebo tDCS","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The tDCS device has a built-in function for double blind studies, i.e., the experimenters are not aware whether they are applying real or sham tDCS.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal Occipital tDCS + audio-visual training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anodal tDCS on ipsilesional occipital cortex.

Participants are seated in front of a 2 m × 2 m training board, at a distance of 1.2 m, in a dimly lit room.

Forty-eight piezoelectric loudspeakers (0.4 W, 8Ω) are located above each light, producing a white-noise (80 dB, duration 100 ms).\n\nSpatio-temporally congruent, cross-modal, audio-visual stimuli are presented at one out of 48 possible positions on the board.
