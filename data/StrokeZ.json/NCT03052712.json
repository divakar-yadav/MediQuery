Social cognition refers to a large group of emotional and cognitive abilities regulating inter-individuals relationships and it includes mainly theory of mind, emotional information processing and empathy. However, assessment of socio-emotional processes is still largely based on experimental tests that are not validated for clinical purpose. In addition their long duration of administration is not adapted to clinical examination. Finally these tests have not been standardized and normalized in French-speaking population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alzheimer Disease","Parkinson Disease","Frontal Dementia","Huntington Disease","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["Disorders of socio-emotional","Alzheimer","frontal temporal dementia","Parkinson","Huntington","traumatic brain injury","stroke","focal lesions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"battery of tests of social cognition","interventionNames":["Behavioral: social cognition"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"battery of tests of social cognition","interventionNames":["Behavioral: social cognition"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"social cognition","description":"battery of tests of social cognition","armGroupLabels":["Control","Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"tests of social cognition (questionnaire)","description":"standardize and validate in French-speaking population a comprehensive battery of tests of social cognition","timeFrame":"3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
