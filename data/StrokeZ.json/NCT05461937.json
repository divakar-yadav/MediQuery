This can have serious, wide-ranging consequences for wellbeing and ability to regain independence. Currently, access to psychological interventions after stroke varies and there is not enough evidence to recommend a specific intervention for executive function difficulties after stroke. A short intervention was designed to help with executive function difficulties by making it easier to set goals and achieve them after stroke. The intervention is designed for online delivery to make it accessible to as many stroke survivors as possible. The present trial aims to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of a single blinded randomized controlled trial of this online executive function intervention (active intervention) compared to an online stroke psychoeducation intervention (control intervention)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Executive Functions","Goal Management","Problem-Solving","Psychoeducation","Telerehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"'Getting things done after stroke' - an online executive function intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Getting things done after stroke"]},{"label":"Stroke psychoeducation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Stroke psychoeducation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Getting things done after stroke","description":"A two-session, online rehabilitation intervention focussing on cognitive executive functions supplemented with weekly homework tasks.","armGroupLabels":["'Getting things done after stroke' - an online executive function intervention"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Stroke psychoeducation","description":"A two-session, online stroke psycho-education intervention supplemented with weekly homework tasks.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke psychoeducation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recruitment Rate","description":"Rate of participants recruited into the trial amongst all participants screened","timeFrame":"Through study completion, approximately 15 months."},{"measure":"Exclusion Rate","description":"Rate of participants excluded from participating amongst all participants screened","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 15 months."},{"measure":"Attrition Rate","description":"Rate of participants and data lost","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 15 months."},{"measure":"Follow-up rate","description":"Rate of participants included at 1-month follow-up","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 15 months."},{"measure":"Time required to collect and analyze data","description":"Time required for data collection per participant and final analysis","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 15 months."},{"measure":"Questionnaire reminders","description":"Number of questionnaire reminders sent and time taken per participant","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 15 months."},{"measure":"Support to complete questionnaires","description":"Number of participants requiring support to complete questionnaires and time taken per participant","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 15 months."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The stroke self-efficacy scale (SSES; Jones et al., 2008)","description":"A 13-item measure of confidence for functional performance and aspects of self-management relevant post-stroke.
