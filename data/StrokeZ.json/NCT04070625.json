In the face of sequelae, particularly in the most serious aphasia, a palliative approach aims to increase the functional effectiveness of communication in everyday life. The communication book has been developed in this perspective, addressing aphasics whose language communication skills are greatly reduced. Early use in this trial is warranted by implantation prior to the onset of potentially deleterious compensatory mechanisms seen in the late-stage aphasic sequelae.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate, in communication tasks, the pragmatic effectiveness of the communication book in the general conditions of use and its maintenance in the implementation of the compensatory strategies of communication in severe aphasias."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Communication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Communication book group","description":"Speech therapy with communication book","interventionNames":["Other: Communication book group"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"Simple speech therapy","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Communication book group","description":"Communication book","armGroupLabels":["Communication book group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"Simple speech therapy","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of successful tasks in the communication book","description":"Communication book of Gonzales et al, with 6 tasks","timeFrame":"At Day 45 after stroke"},{"measure":"Number of successful tasks in the communication book","description":"Communication book of Gonzales et al, with 6 tasks","timeFrame":"At Day 90 after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Informed consent after information.
