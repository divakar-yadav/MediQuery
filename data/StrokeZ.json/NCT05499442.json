The investigators collect and analyze the EEG activity at the motor cortices of the participants, When the motor movement or imagery task is being performed. The alpha and beta wave of EEGs were recorded from 32 electrodes as per the international 10-20 system with portable EEG equipment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EEG characteristics of motor","description":"EEG Characteristics for Motor Execution and Motor Imagery","timeFrame":"1-7day"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test","description":"Use the assessment scale of Action Research Arm Test evaluation completes the limb function evaluation","timeFrame":"1-7days"},{"measure":"Fugl-meyer Assessment","description":"Use the assessment scale of Fuel-meyer to evaluate completes the limb function evaluation","timeFrame":"1-7days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
