The study is designed as pre- post-intervention study in which specialized SU nurses partner with ED nursing staff to asses and screen stroke admissions in the ED.","detailedDescription":"An intervention study comprised of 1) a primary registry database component and 2) a secondary questionnaire based quantitative evaluation . The intervention study includes a 3-month baseline observational period followed by a 7-month baseline data collection period, a 2-month intervention implementation phase, and a 3-month intervention observational period followed by 7-month intervention data collection period.\n\nAn intervention, where dedicated stroke nurses handle acute care of stroke and TIA patient in the ED prior to admission to a dedicated stroke unit will take place in the timeframe of 11-19:00 hrs, 7 days a week. Notably, the intervention is set to be integrated into clinical practice on a permanent basis after end of study.\n\nData for all stroke patients admitted to the ED at HGH are collected during the 3-month baseline and intervention observational periods. Fulfilment of Danish Stroke Quality Program (DAP) quality indicators is monitored as follows - use of dysphagia screen (GUSS), mobilization within day of ED admission and transfer to SU. Additional nursing interventions monitored in the ED are: Use of nasogastric catheter, use of bladder scan and intermittent catheterization, frequency of temperature monitoring and use of anti-pyretics, acute phase monitoring of blood-pressure every 2 hours, use of Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) score.\n\nOutcomes are monitored in hospital and at visits to the out patient clinic, as well as by registry."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","TIA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":800,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Baseline period","description":"Usual care.
