CVAs are a particular problem for the VA because of the large population of World War II and Korean War veterans who are now in the age range where CVAs are most frequent; in fiscal year 1997 the national VA system had 22,000 admissions for an acute CVA. The consequent motor deficits that veterans sustain result in very large costs to the VA and the Federal Government. The reduction of CVA-related disability thus represents a high VA and national health care priority.\n\nConstraint-Induced (CI) therapy is one of the few techniques that has been proven with controlled, randomized studies to substantially reduce the incapacitating motor deficit of the more-affected upper extremity of patients with mild to moderately severe chronic strokes. The procedures of CI therapy are relatively simple and are deemed effective because they produce transfer of increased extremity use to the activities of daily living in the real world environment. The therapy involves promoting use of the more-affected upper extremity for 90% of waking hours by constraining the less-affected extremity for two or three consecutive weeks with a resting hand splint and sling or other device which prevents movement of the hand and wrist for activities of daily living. The patients receive a type of training termed \"shaping\" for 7 hours/day (with rest intervals) for all weekdays during this period (massed practice).\n\nWe propose to develop and evaluate a workstation that significantly enhances the application of CI therapy by automating and instrumenting several of the tasks currently used in the shaping training. The motivation for development of such a device is as follows: 1) Patients could receive CI therapy at home without the need for constant supervision from a therapist. Many veterans do not have the resources to travel to their local VAMC for the two or three week period required for the treatment.
