The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of game-based training on patient motivation, exercise duration, and functional outcomes in comparison with the control group.","detailedDescription":"A 12-week three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects between the single-player game, competitive game and a control group (i.e. conventional training) on the motivation, exercise duration and functional improvement in a rehabilitation program. A mix of quantitative method (i.e., questionnaire) and qualitative methods (i.e., interview and observation) were used. The outcome measurements were: (1) motivation: Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), (2) participation: exercise duration, (3) functional improvement: nine-hole peg test (NHPT) and box and block test (BBT), and (4) user feedback."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","upper limb rehabilitation","neuro-rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"3-arm randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"traditional wooden checkerboard","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"upper limb training with traditional wooden checkerboard","interventionNames":["Other: traditional wooden checkerboard"]},{"label":"gaming board with single-player games","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"upper limb training with a LED-based interactive gaming board equipped with single-player games","interventionNames":["Other: gaming board with single-player games"]},{"label":"gaming board with two-player games","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"upper limb training with two LED-based interactive gaming boards equipped with two-player competitive games","interventionNames":["Other: gaming board with two-player games"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"traditional wooden checkerboard","description":"upper limb training with traditional wooden checkerboard","armGroupLabels":["traditional wooden checkerboard"],"otherNames":["checkerboard for upper limb training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"gaming board with single-player games","description":"upper limb training with a LED-based interactive gaming board equipped with single-player games","armGroupLabels":["gaming board with single-player games"],"otherNames":["interactive gaming board with single-player games"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"gaming board with two-player games","description":"upper limb training with two LED-based interactive gaming boards equipped with two-player competitive games","armGroupLabels":["gaming board with two-player games"],"otherNames":["interactive gaming board with two-player competitive games"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline motivation at 12 weeks","description":"Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) - psychological measurement of motivation questionnaire","timeFrame":"week 1, week 12"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline function of manual dexterity at 12 weeks","description":"Measuring gross manual dexterity Block and Box Test (BBT)","timeFrame":"week 1, week 12"},{"measure":"Change from baseline function of finger dexterity at 12 weeks","description":"Measuring finger dexterity with Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT)","timeFrame":"week 1, week 12"},{"measure":"Exercise duration","description":"Overall exercise duration over12 weeks","timeFrame":"week 1 to week 12"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
