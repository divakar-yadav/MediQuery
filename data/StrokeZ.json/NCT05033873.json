The prevalence of stroke was 1.2 % (1200/100,000) in Pakistan, 3.1% in China and it is 44.29 to 559/100,000 in different parts of the world. Leading cause of stroke is hypertension. The aim of study will be to compare universal exercise unit therapy with sling exercise therapy on lower limb kinematics, disability, balance and quality of life in chronic stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This will be randomized controlled trial. Study will be conducted at Khawaja Arshed Hospital Sargodha. Duration of intervention will be 08 weeks, 5 sessions in a week, total 40 sessions. Duration of single session will be one hour. A convenient sample of n patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be selected from in-patient settings of various hospitals from the city Sargodha and will be allocated randomly into three groups equally after taking informed consent. Group A will obtain Universal Exercise Unit Therapy. Group B will obtain Sling Exercise Therapy and Group C will be control and will receive routine physical therapy. Outcome will be measured at baseline, 04 weeks and 08 weeks. Outcome measurement tools will be Berg balance scale, Barthel index, Short form 12 (SF-12), Trunk impairment scale, functional reach test and smart phone motion analysis for lower limb kinematics. Scores will be measure in mean and SD. Results of intervention will be comparing by using one way ANOVA by using IBM SPSS version 21.0"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Motion analysis","Universal exercise unit","Sling exercise therapy","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A: Universal Exercise Unit Therapy (UEU)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This experimental group will be given universal exercise unit therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Universal Exercise Unit Therapy (UEU)"]},{"label":"Group B: Sling Exercise Therapy (SET)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This experimental group will be given sling exercise therapy","interventionNames":["Other: Sling Exercise Therapt (SET)"]},{"label":"Group C: Control Group","type":"OTHER","description":"Control group will be given routine physical therapy","interventionNames":["Other: Routine Physical Therapy / Control Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Universal Exercise Unit Therapy (UEU)","description":"Standing, walk standing, half standing, kneel standing, half kneel standing, quadruped position, three point quadruped , alternative quadruped , transitions, walking all these will be done in Universal Exercise Unit with a standardized protocol regimen.","armGroupLabels":["Group A: Universal Exercise Unit Therapy (UEU)"],"otherNames":["Group A"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sling Exercise Therapt (SET)","description":"1.
