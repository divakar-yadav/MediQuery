The infusion will start at a rate of 5 mg/h, and then gradually tapered up during the first 3 hours by 5 mg an hour. Similarly, the infusion rate will be gradually tapered down at a rate of 5 mg/h during the last 3 hours of infusion. The patients randomized to the 'placebo arm' of the trial will receive normal saline infusion at the same rates. In order to prevent the psychogenic adverse effects associated with Ketamine, the patients will be administered Midazolam at a dose of 1 mg IV every 4 hours. Midazolam will also be administered at the same rate to the patients randomized to the placebo arm. Blood Ketamine levels will be measured before starting the treatment, and daily while the infusion is on. While receiving treatment, the patients will be admitted to the telemetry floor in the hospital, on a monitored bed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, Neuroprotection, Ketamine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Drug","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Will receive Ketamine infusion, and Midazolam (Versed).","interventionNames":["Drug: Ketamine","Drug: Midazolam injection"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Will receive Normal saline infusion and Midazolam (Versed).","interventionNames":["Other: Normal Saline","Drug: Midazolam injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ketamine","description":"IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Study Drug"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Normal Saline","description":"IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Midazolam injection","description":"Injection","armGroupLabels":["Placebo","Study Drug"],"otherNames":["Versed"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in weighted modified Rankin scale score between day 1 and 90 will be assessed.","description":"An improvement of 2 in mRS score will be considered favorable outcome.","timeFrame":"On day 1 and at 90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel's index","description":"An improvement of 10 or more points in Barthel's index will be considered a favorable outcome.","timeFrame":"On day 1, and at 90 days"},{"measure":"NIH stroke scale score","timeFrame":"On day 1, day 4 or discharge whichever is earlier, and at 90 days"},{"measure":"Depression score using the PHQ9 questionnaire","timeFrame":"On day 1, and day 4 or discharge whichever is earlier."},{"measure":"Infarct volumes","description":"Measured from the DWI-MRI and/or CT images","timeFrame":"On day 1, and day 4 or discharge whichever is earlier"},{"measure":"All cause mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Stroke-related mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","timeFrame":"Day 4 or discharge whichever is earlier"},{"measure":"Deterioration in neurologic status","description":"Increase of 4 or more points in the NIH stroke scale","timeFrame":"Up to day 4 or discharge whichever is earlier"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
