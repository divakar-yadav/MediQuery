It's one of the most disabling consequence of stroke. Nowadays, aphasia rehabilitation is supported by speech therapists and is based on oral and written language, comprehension and expression. However recent studies have shown links between language and motor function (especially tool use). Two domains that share neural substrates (Broca's area, basal ganglia) and that can influence each other.\n\nThe aim of this study is to show that a motor training with a tool (pliers) can improve short-term and long-term language abilities of aphasic patients who had a stroke at least 3 months ago.\n\nThe investigators hypothesis is that there is a learning transfer between tool use and language abilities in aphasic patients with an inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) lesion caused by a stroke, thanks to their shared neural resources.\n\nInvestigators aim to study long and short-time effects of this tool motor training with three experiments:\n\n* E1 will study short-term effects by estimating pre-post effect of a motor training on language abilities. Investigators will experiment different effectors: tool, hand, none (control group); on patients and healthy volunteers.\n* E2 will study long-term effects with multiple single-case experimental designs (SCED). Patients will undergo four weeks of on-off design.\n* E3 will study long-term effects by estimating the efficiency of an experimental sensorimotor protocol of four weeks, comparing a group of patients with the experimental sensorimotor protocol to a control group of patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"],"keywords":["stroke","aphasia","rehabilitation","tool use","Broca's area","basal ganglia","healthy volunteer","language and motor abilities"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":360,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sub-study E1, arm 1, patients and tool motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients undergo a 30 minutes tool motor training and two linguistic tasks (one before and one after).","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: Motor training with a tool","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E1, arm 2, patients and hand motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients undergo a 30 minutes hand motor training and two linguistic tasks (one before and one after).","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: Motor training with a hand","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E1, arm 3, patients and no motor training (control group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients only undergo two linguistic tasks separated by a 30-minutes break (without motor activity (control group)).","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E1, arm 4, healthy volunteers and tool motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"healthy volunteers undergo a 30 minutes tool motor training and two linguistic tasks (one before and one after).","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: Motor training with a tool","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E1, arm 5, healthy volunteers and hand motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"healthy volunteers undergo a 30 minutes hand motor training and two linguistic tasks (one before and one after).","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: Motor training with a hand","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E1, arm 6, healthy volunteers and no motor training (control group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"healthy volunteers only undergo two linguistic tasks separated by a 30-minutes break (without motor activity (control group)).","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E2, arm 1, single case design","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients undergo 4 weeks of tool motor training according to an on/off design.","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: on/off effect of tool motor training","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E3, arm 1, patients and 4 week experimental sensorimotor protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients undergo 4 weeks of tool motor training","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: Motor training with a tool","Other: linguistic tasks"]},{"label":"Sub-study E3, arm 2, control group of patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"aphasic patients receiving the standard treatment as a control group","interventionNames":["Other: Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","Other: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","Other: Purdue Pegboard Test","Other: The Box and Block Test (BBT)","Other: linguistic tasks"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Syntactic comprehension battery (BCS)","description":"The BCS is a battery for assessing syntactic skills.
