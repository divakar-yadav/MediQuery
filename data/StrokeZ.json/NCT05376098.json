Fifty patients having experienced a stroke onset within seven days will be recruited from the emergency room. The fNIRS signals will be recorded bilaterally over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, the premotor area, the supplementary motor area, the primary motor cortex for 14 days after being diagnosed. Then compute activation and connectivity of the regions. The motor function data measured by the assessment scales, as well as the behavioral record during the fNIRS motor tasks will be collected as well."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Motor rehabilitation","Brain regions","fNIRS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"fNIRS characteristics of upper limb movement","description":"The changes in brain oxygen levels are collected in two wavelengths, including 845 and 763 nanometers using a 44 channeled fNIRS machine.
