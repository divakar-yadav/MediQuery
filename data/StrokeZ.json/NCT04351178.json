The purpose of the present proposal is to implement and evaluate F@ce 2.0 on functioning in activities in daily living (ADL) and participation in everyday life among persons with stroke and their significant others (someone identified by the person with stroke as close i.e.partner, friend, son, daughter).\n\nWith recommendations on evaluation of complex interventions both outcomes and processes will be studied and hence both quantitative and qualitative methods will be applied. In a randomized controlled trial F@ce 2.0 will be evaluated compared to ordinary rehabilitation in urban/rural Sweden regarding; self-efficacy, perceived performance and participation in everyday activities, independence in ADL, health care utilization and the familiesÂ´ perceived participation in everyday activities. Qualitative data will explore experiences of people with stroke, significant others and rehabilitation staff of participating in F@ce 2.0. The research project has a multidisciplinary perspective for sustainable rehabilitation interventions, a prerequisite for better participation in everyday life for people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomly assigned to participate in F@ce 2.0 (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving usual rehabilitation at two different sites; both an urban (IG+CG) and rural site (CG+IG) in Sweden","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mobile phone supported and team based rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the intervention group will receive an 8-week mobile phone supported and team based rehabilitation intervention (F@ce 2.0)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Mobile phone supported and team based rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Rehabilitation as usual","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group participants will receive rehabilitation as usual and in addition information about stroke.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Rehabilitation as usual"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Mobile phone supported and team based rehabilitation","description":"Participants in the intervention group will receive an 8-week mobile phone supported and team based rehabilitation intervention (F@ce 2.0).The participants will be introduced to a problem-solving strategy intended to facilitate the learning and problem-solving process to be used during the intervention.

Each activity will be practiced together with the healthcare professionals and significant others.
