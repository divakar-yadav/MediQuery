This study will also characterize the neuromuscular and kinematic strategies to adapt to resisted treadmill walking in non-impaired adults and stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study includes chronic stroke patients who will be randomly assigned to treadmill training combined with thera-band or treadmill training alone group to receive 30 min per session, 2 sessions per week for 8 weeks walking training . Functional balance (Berg Balance Scale), gait characteristics during preferred and maximal speed level walking, and oxygen uptake during 5-minute bouts of treadmill walking will be assessed before and after training and at 2-month follow-up. Clinical sensorimotor function assessment, including hand grip strength, plantar sensitivity, stroke rehabilitation assessment of movement and Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor scale will also be conducted for subject characterization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treadmill training combined with thera-band","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive walking training on treadmill with thera-band at the waist.
