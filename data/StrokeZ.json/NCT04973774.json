However, due to the fact that the existing imaging techniques cannot depict small vessel changes, the clinical diagnosis, therapy and research of BAD are facing challenges. We have started a multi-center prospective observational study of BAD in China, aiming at establishing a large-sample clinical-radiological cohort of BAD, analyzing predictors for functional outcome, and exploring the efficacy of tirofiban on BAD. A standardized Case Report Form (and eCRF on website) is used to collect baseline and follow-up information on epidemiological, clinical, radiological（MRI, SWI, MRA, HRMRI,3TVWI）and blood test. The primary outcome was mRS on 90 days with blind evaluation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction","Disease","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"],"keywords":["branch atheromatous disease","prospective","tirofiban","antiplatelet","prognosis","Lenticulostriate artery","HRMRI","3TVWI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified ranking score","description":"modified ranking score on 90 days, range:0-6scores; higher score means worse outcome","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Meet the following radiological criterial： 1) DWI infarct: single (isolated) deep (subcortical) infarct. 2) The culprit vessels are the lenticulostriate artery or the para-pontine median artery, and the infarct lesion on DWI conforms to one of the following characteri stics(A/B): A. Lenticulostriate artery: ① \"comma-like\" infarct lesions with \"fan-shaped\" extension from bottom to top in the coronary position; OR ② ≥3 layers (layer thickness 5-7 mm) on axial DWI images of the head; B. Para-pontine median artery: the infarct lesion extends from the deep pons to the ventral pons on the axial DWI of the head.\n\n3) No ≥50% stenosis on the parent artery of the criminal vessel (i.e. corresponding basilar or middle cerebral artery) (confirmed by MRA or CTA or DSA).\n\n5.Signed informed consent by the patient or legally authorised representatives\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Intracranial hemorrhagic diseases, vascular malformations, aneurysms, brain abscesses, malignant space occupying lesions or other non-ischemic intracranial lesions observed by baseline head CT and MRI, MRA/CTA/DSA;\n2.
