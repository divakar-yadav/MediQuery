In terms of symptoms of ischemic stroke, patients who have motor function impairment with FMA motor score ≤ 55 as well as neurological function impairment with K-NIHSS score ≥ 4 and ≤ 15 are eligible for study participation. A subject who is considered by the investigator to be appropriate for study participation and provides informed consent will participate in this study.\n\nAt baseline, subjects will be randomized to HT047 high dose group (2250 mg/day), HT047 low dose group (1500 mg/day), or placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio in a double blind fashion and be treated with the investigational product for 12 weeks starting from the next morning of baseline with a three times a day dosing schedule, 3 tablets per dose.\n\nSince this is a first-in-human trial for HT047, subjects will have a study visit at Week 1 (Day 7) of participation for laboratory tests, ECG, and chest x-ray. A one-month portion of the investigational product will be supplied. During study treatment, subjects will visit the hospital at Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.\n\nDuring the Week 1 visit, the above tests will be performed and the subject's physical status will be checked before he/she is sent home. In the subsequent visits, neurological function assessment and drug exchange will be carried out. At each visit, the study staff should carefully check the subject's medication compliance and verify the accurate number of remaining doses to be countered.\n\nAfter 12 weeks of study conduct as shown in the above figure, at Week 12, laboratory tests performed at Week 1 will be repeated and overall change in the subject's status will be confirmed before all study procedures are ended."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["HT047","Pueraria lobata","Scutellaria baicalensis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":78,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HT047 High-dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"three times a day dosing schedule 3 tablets per dose","interventionNames":["Drug: HT047 High-dose group"]},{"label":"HT047 Low-dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"three times a day dosing schedule 3 tablets per dose","interventionNames":["Drug: HT047 Low-dose group"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"three times a day dosing schedule 3 tablets per dose","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"HT047 High-dose group","description":"HT047 2250mg, three times a day dosing schedule, 3 tablets per dose","armGroupLabels":["HT047 High-dose group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"HT047 Low-dose group","description":"HT047 1500mg, three times a day dosing schedule, 3 tablets per dose","armGroupLabels":["HT047 Low-dose group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"placebo having the same appearance as HT047 Tab. 250mg","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change at Week 12 of treatment with HT047 Tab. from baseline in Korean version of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) motor function score","description":"Total score of motor function test for upper extremity in 66 marks plus total score of motor function test for lower extremity in 34 marks is 100 marks.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 from baseline in FMA motor function score","description":"Total score of motor function test for upper extremity in 66 marks plus total score of motor function test for lower extremity in 34 marks is 100 marks.","timeFrame":"4weeks, 8weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Change at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 from baseline in FMA motor function score according to the timing of treatment initiation after the onset of stroke.","description":"Total score of motor function test for upper extremity in 66 marks plus total score of motor function test for lower extremity in 34 marks is 100 marks.","timeFrame":"4weeks, 8weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Change at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 from baseline in FMA motor function score according to the presence of prognostic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, etc.)","description":"Total score of motor function test for upper extremity in 66 marks plus total score of motor function test for lower extremity in 34 marks is 100 marks.","timeFrame":"4weeks, 8weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Change at Weeks 4 and 12 from baseline in Korean-National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (K-NIHSS) scores","description":"Total score of K-NIHSS would be scored by 11 categories.","timeFrame":"4weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Change at Weeks 4 and 12 from baseline in Korean modified Rankin Scale (K-mRS) scores","description":"Different 6 questions can be scored by 0-5 marks.","timeFrame":"4weeks, 12weeks"},{"measure":"Proportion of subjects with K-NIHSS score 0 - 2 at Week 12","description":"Total score of K-NIHSS would be scored by 11 categories.","timeFrame":"12weeks"},{"measure":"Proportion of subjects with K-mRS score 0, ≤ 1, and ≤ 2 at Week 12","description":"Different 6 questions can be scored by 0-5 marks.","timeFrame":"12weeks"},{"measure":"Change at Weeks 4 and 12 from baseline in Korean Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) score","description":"Total scores (0-100) should be rated by 5 stages in 10 categories.","timeFrame":"4weeks, 12weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
