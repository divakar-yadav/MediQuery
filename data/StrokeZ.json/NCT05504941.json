The most important potentially modifiable prognostic factor after acute diagnosis of an ICH is hematoma expansion.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that in hyperacute ICH patients a treatment target can be detected with a diagnostic, cerebral DSA. The DSA is the goldstandard for the visualization of brain vessels. A treatment target would be a vessel from which contrast media extravasates as a sign of an active bleeding. If such a target could be identified, it could lay the rationale for future trials which would evaluate if stopping the bleeding directly at the origin improves patient outcomes. The only intervention in this study is an additional diagnostic cerebral DSA. This study is to determine if a treatment target for a potential endovascular therapy exists in patients with an acute, spontaneous (non-traumatic) ICH."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Nontraumatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)","Hemorrhagic stroke","Hematoma expansion","Cerebral DSA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Explorative, one-arm, open label trial","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"A person blinded to all clinical data will assess the primary endpoint."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Intervention: DSA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"additional diagnostic cerebral DSA","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Diagnostic, cerebral Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Diagnostic, cerebral Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)","description":"The DSA is the goldstandard for the visualization of brain vessels.
