ICAS accounted for 10% to 15% of ischemic stroke in Western countries, and as much as 46.6%in Asia in 2009.\n\nFor patients with ICAS, the risk of stroke is highly related to the histopathology of atheromatous plaques. Therefore, characterizing the morphology and composition of plaques in ICAS may help to predict the risk of stroke occurrence and allow the adoption of preventive or therapeutic management to prevent such life-threatening events. OCT, with a resolution of 10μm, may provide more reliable information in characterizing atheromatous plagues.\n\nThis study aims to get a better insight into the value of OCT in evaluating the vessel wall structure and therefore guiding the interventional therapy of ICAS. In addition, the clinical and biological information will be included to achieve correlation analysis so as to get biomarkers subject to various plaque characteristics."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Atherosclerosis","Optical Coherence Tomography","Plaque, Atherosclerotic","Artery Stenosis","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Optical Coherence Tomography","Intravascular Imaging","Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis","Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty and Stenting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Peripheral blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)","description":"OCT and other classical imaging evaluation such as Transcranial Color Doppler (TCCD) and High resolution-MRI will be performed.
