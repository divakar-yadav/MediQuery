To our knowledge, no study completely investigated MI ability in one individual whereas MI practice can be performed using visual or kinesthetic modalities (respectively visualizing with mind's eyes or imagining movement using sensation) and internal or external perspectives (performing action as spectator or as actor). This study aims to investigate MI ability in patients with stroke as compared to aged-matched healthy individuals. The investigators will assess explicit MI ability using 3 questionnaires (Movement Imagery Questionnaire-RS - MIQ-RS, Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20 - KVIQ-20, Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2 - VMIQ-2) and 2 tests (imagined Time Up and Go - iTUG, imagined Box and Block test - iBBT). Outcome parameters will be i) the composite score of vividness measured for all tests using Likert scales, ii) the temporal equivalence between MI and Physical practice (PP - where MI/PP ratio equal to 1 indicate good MI ability and respect of temporal equivalence between MI and PP) and iii) the amplitude of electrodermal activity. The investigators will also study implicit MI ability using a hand laterality judgment task. Outcomes parameters will be response time (i.e. the duration to identify the hand laterality) and the percentage of correct responses."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The investigator will include patients with stroke (either hemorrhagic or ischemic) with or without neglect in the experimental group.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Assessment of motor imagery ability"]},{"label":"Healthy subjects","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The investigator will include healthy subjects aged-matched to participants of the experimental group in the control group.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Assessment of motor imagery ability of healthy subject"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Assessment of motor imagery ability","description":"The intervention will last 3 hours ± 45 minutes, the assessment will be spread over 3 sessions of 1 hour ± 15 minutes on one week.
