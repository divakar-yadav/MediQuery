The hypothesis is that safety issue, as regards to cardiovascular risk, is not homogenous across the spectrum of androgen-deprivation therapy modalities. Our study will encompass all ADT modalities including intermittent ADT.\n\nADT is a cornerstone therapy in prostate cancer management. Decisions about ADT should weigh improvements in cancer-specific outcomes against potential increased risks for cardiovascular diseases. The potential for harm from ADT should be more precisely defined according to the type of ADT. Those potential risks underscore the importance of better understanding benefits of ADT, especially in contexts where data are still lacking.ADT is also indicated in sexually deviant behavior.","detailedDescription":"Our study is a nationwide population-based prospective cohort on 4 years thanks to the French Health Reimbursement Agency database (Système National d'Information Inter-Régimes de l'Assurance Maladie, SNIIRAM) and French hospital discharge database (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information; PMSI). A unique civil registration number has been assigned to all French residents and this number unambiguously links those two databases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Cancer","Androgen-deprivation Therapy"],"keywords":["Androgen-deprivation therapy","Prostate cancer","Nationwide population-based cohort","Myocardial infarction","Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38690,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Men with prostate cancer with androgen-deprivation therapy","description":"Using the French Health Reimbursement Agency database and French hospital discharge database, the investigators will identify all men with prostate cancer who had either, at least one dispensation in a 1.5-year period (1st July 2010 to 31st December 2011) of an androgen-deprivation therapy or a hospitalization for orchiectomy.
