This study will be conducted in up to 20 centers in Germany and Austria. This is an adaptive design study, in which there are prospectively stated interim analyses with specified stopping rules, which allow for the possibility of the study to terminate early based on either a determination of study success or of the futility to continue further enrollment.\n\nUp to six hundred (600) subjects, 300 per treatment group, will be enrolled and randomized in the study for the Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis set. The randomization will be stratified by time from symptom onset and stroke severity (NIHSS). The expected duration of each subject\"s enrollment is approximately 90 days. Subjects will be followed with assessments at 30 (+/-6) hours, hospital discharge, and 90 (+/-14) days post stroke.\n\nA blinded core laboratory will assess baseline imaging to confirm vessel occlusion and determine ASPECT score, 30 (+/- 6) hours post treatment imaging to assess presence of ICH, and to measure core infarct volume.\n\nThe primary effectiveness endpoint for a subject is the blinded evaluation of the ordinal mRS outcome at 90 days post-stroke. The primary effectiveness endpoint analysis is a chi-square test of the difference in linear trends in mRS outcomes at 90 days post-stroke between treatment groups (\"mRS shift analysis\")."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebral Stroke, Stroke, Acute, Brain Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Best medical care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Best clinical care in dedicated stroke unit","interventionNames":["Other: Best medical care"]},{"label":"Thrombectomy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"All subjects randomly assigned to the thrombectomy arm, except those with rapidly improving neurologic symptoms or no angiographic evidence of occlusion, will be treated with the endorsed study devices (stent retriever).","interventionNames":["Device: Thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Thrombectomy","description":"Stent retriever are intended to restore blood flow in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to intracranial occlusive vessel disease by providing temporary bypass across the occlusion and/or by the non-surgical removal of emboli and thrombi.
