We hypothesized that the exergaming program using weight shifting as game controller is better than the weight shifting only program. The investigators further hypothesized that exergames designed for entertainment (such as Wii Fit) are more beneficial than exergames for rehabilitation purpose (such as Tetrax biofeedback) in gain of cognition function for patients with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cognition","Exergames","Weight shifting","Balance","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Wii Fit","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Wii Fit training was conducted using the Wii Fit bundle from Nintendo, which consists of the Wii console, a Wii Balance Board, and the Wii Fit Plus balance game disc. The Wii balance board has 4 transducers, which could assess the player's force distribution and resultant movements in the center of pressure (COP). The participants stood on the board and used the change of COP to play the games. Five games (Tilt, Soccer Heading, Balance Bubble, Penguin Slide, and Perfect 10) were selected from the Wii Fit Plus package based on the motor demand of these games.

The parameters of games' difficulties included target size and/or speed of target movement, which could be adjusted according to the patients' ability.\n\nFor the Wii Fit or Tetrax group, at each session, the supervising therapist chose 3 to 5 games for participants according to their ability, needs, and favorites.","interventionNames":["Device: Tetrax biofeedback(30 Mins)"]},{"label":"Conventional weight-shifting","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The conventional weight-shifting exercise group performed balance exercises with the similar movements and time required by the 2 exergame systems but without video games.

The overall SIS score represents the average score of the 8 domains. Each item score ranges from 1 to 5.
