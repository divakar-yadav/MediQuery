We propose the testing apparatus will accurately provide an equivalent clinical measure of spasticity while also providing a more precise estimation of spastic response in persons with stroke.","detailedDescription":"An ongoing conversation amongst clinicians exists on how to properly define, measure, and manage spasticity. The standard measurement tools are the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the Tardieu scale, although both of these lack reliability and specificity, causing variability between clinicians and a lack of accurate spasticity measurement. In addition, some have concerns about whether the MAS measures true spasticity at all. Due to this lack of trust in these scales, clinicians often use them as a communication tool to identify the presence of spasticity, rather than as reliable quantifiable outcome measurements.\n\nThe MAS and Tardieu function mainly on the principal of catch, a limb is moved slowly by a clinician through the available range of motion, and then quickly. Hyperactive muscles are sensitive to velocity dependent stretch and will activate a reflex if quickly perturbed. In both the MAS and Tardieu, the catch location is noted and translated into a score. In MAS the catch location is only noted in three distinct ranges; with the Tardieu Scale the catch angle is remembered by the clinician and recorded after the movement with a standard goniometer.\n\nHere we will test a new handheld spasticity measurement tool MITSS (Modified Intelligent Tardieu Scale for Spasticity), which is essentially a 3-DOF digital goniometer, to quantify the catch angle as well as general forces at the joint."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Spasticity","Hyperreflexia","Clonus","Hypertonia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Measurement Group","description":"All participants will have their arm spasticity to be measured using standard clinical scales","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Tardieu Scale for Spasticity"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Tardieu Scale for Spasticity","description":"The clinician will rotate the elbow joint at various speeds while the participant sits relaxed.","armGroupLabels":["Measurement Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Catch angle","description":"Elbow angle in which there is a marked increase in tone while rotating quickly.
