There is variety of crucial sign and symptoms that can occur during stroke include changes in the level of consciousness and impairments of sensation and motor or cognitive function loss. It also includes changes in perceptual and language functions. Worldwide, 55 million people died of stroke in 2002, and approximately 20 percent of these deaths occurred in South Asia. Predicting amounts of deaths from stroke will increase to 63 million in 2015 and 78 million by 2030 with the mass occurring in the poor countries of the world. Rehabilitation plays a major role in minimizing activity limitation and participation restriction or to decrease extent of impairments. Stroke can cause variety of impairments which have greater impact on the patient quality of life. Hemiparesis is the common impairment, in which involvement of upper limb is commonly seen.\n\nmCIMT and BAT techniques both play an important role in the treatment of stroke. In this research, both techniques will be use to evaluate which treatment technique is better for upper extremity chronic stroke patients. Written informed consent will be taken. Each participant will be requested to draw either number one or number two from a box. Number one will be allocated to Group A and number two will be allocated to group B. The A group will receive mCIMT after applying conservative management and Group B will receive BAT for 5 days a week for 8 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Bilateral Arm Training (BAT)","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Each participant will be requested to draw either number one or number two from a box.
