The secondary hypothesis is that improvement of visual field defect would be accompanied by connectivity changes in visual networks. In addition, investigators will evaluate whether improvement of visual field defect could achieve improvement of subjective visual function.","detailedDescription":"Study design: A PROBE (Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Blinded-endpoint) design\n\nMethods:\n\n1. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) group\n\n   1. Visual perceptual learning (24 times for 2 months, 3 times per week) in visual field defect areas\n   2. At baseline and post-VPL evaluations (2 months after): Structural \\& Functional MRIs, Visual field tests, Visual evoked potential, Visual cognitive tests, Subjective visual function questionnaires\n2. Control group\n\n   1. At baseline and 2-months later: No VPL, Structural \\& Functional MRIs, Visual field tests, Visual evoked potential, Visual cognitive tests, Subjective visual function questionnaires\n   2. Visual perceptual learning after 2-month follow-up evaluation (24 times for 2 months, 3 times per week)\n\n   (The patients who were stratified by age (over 65 years old or not) and degree of visual field defect (quadrantanopia or complete hemianopia) will be randomly assigned into the learning and control group.)\n3. Investigations\n\n   1. Improvement of visual field test scores between VPL group and control group\n   2. Analysis of brain network changes in MRI data\n   3. Correlation analysis of improvement of visual field defect and MRI data\n   4. Correlation analysis of improvement of visual field defect and visual evoked potential (VEP) data\n   5. Correlation analysis of improvement of visual field defect and neuropsychological data"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Visual Field Defect"],"keywords":["Stroke","Visual Field Defect","Visual perceptual learning","Brain connectivity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Learning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Visual perceptual learning (VPL) group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Visual perceptual learning"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Control group"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Visual perceptual learning","description":"24 times of training for visual perceptual learning","armGroupLabels":["Learning"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Improvement of visual field scores in visual field defect areas","description":"Improvement of mean deviation scores in defected areas by Humphrey 750i Field test","timeFrame":"At 2 months (plus or minus 7 days) after baseline evaluation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Performance of visual perceptual learning","description":"Performance (scores) of visual perceptual learning","timeFrame":"At 2 months (plus or minus 7 days) after baseline evaulation"},{"measure":"Connectivity changes in MRI","description":"1.
