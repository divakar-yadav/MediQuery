Brain Computer Interface (BCI) driven functional electrical stimulation will be compared to conventional training.","detailedDescription":"A randomized controlled pilot study will be conducted. Forty patients with severe UL paresis will be included. Patients with severe hemiparesis after stroke will be allocated to one of two treatment groups by a computerized randomization program. Patients in the intervention group will receive training with a BCI system paired with functional electrical stimulation and visual feedback (RecoveriX, gtec, Austria) as part of their rehabilitation. The targeted number of training sessions in the intervention group is 12. Patients in the control group will receive conventional upper limb training. All patients will receive other rehabilitation according to their needs.\n\nPatients will be assessed by blinded raters before and after the intervention and 3 months post stroke. Main endpoint will be UL motor function assessed by Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) at 3 months post stroke. Other outcome measures comprise Fugl Meyer Motor Assessment and Functional Independence Measure. The patients and therapists' experience with this type of training will be evaluated with questionnaires and interviews."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["BCI","upper limb","severe paresis","subacute stroke","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients are randomized to one of two treatment options, intervention or standard rehabilitation","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"All assessments will be done by assessors blinded to treatment allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BCI training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to this group will receive up to12 (minimum 8) sessions of BCI training with the RecoveriX system (gtec, Austria).
