Using novel technologies the patients will receive an augmented exercise therapy during the first weeks after stroke. The effects on restoration of functions as well as on the costs incurred from social and health care services will be assessed and compared to the conventional rehabilitation over 6 month follow-up.","detailedDescription":"The intervention consists of technology-assisted multidisciplinary rehabilitation for 3 weeks followed by an 8-week period of supervised home-based telerehabilitation and a weekly group exercise in an outpatient clinic. The effects on mobility, upper extremity motor functions and activities of daily living will be assessed using FAC, hand grip force, shoulder elevation test, WHODAS 2.0 and PROMIS scales. The costs incurred from social and health care services over 6 months will be compared to the control group receiving conventional rehabilitation. Patients aged 18 or more with their first stroke and stable cardiopulmonary condition will be consecutively recruited first into the control group (n=20) and thereafter into the experimental group (n=20). Patients with a severe cognitive deficit or aphasia will be excluded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Consecutive cohort study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Technology-assisted rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Augmented exercise therapy with novel technology","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Technology-assisted rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Traditional multidisciplinary rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Technology-assisted rehabilitation","description":"Augmented exercise therapy with novel technology and home-based telerehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Technology-assisted rehabilitation"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Conventional rehabilitation","description":"Traditional multidisciplinary in-patient rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Conventional rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"WHODAS 2.0","description":"World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule - 12 questions scoring 1 to 5 yielding a total score from 12 to 60.
