This study will consist of 2 parts, with part 1 being a dose-escalation study and part 2 being an expanded safety study based on part 1 findings.\n\nA traditional 3+3 dose escalation design will be implemented in part 1. Cohort 1 receive 20μg/kg; cohort 2 40μg/kg and cohort 3 80μg/kg. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed for 2 weeks after administration of the first injection, a new cohort will be enrolled at the next planned dose level. If DLTs are observed in 1 participant in the cohort, another 3 participants will be treated in the same dose level. Dose escalation will be stopped until DLTs are observed in \\>33% of the participants.\n\nIn part 2, 20 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio \\[exosome (n=10) or exosome placebo (n=10)\\]. The dose level will be determined by Data Safety Monitoring Board based on part 1."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["exosome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exosomes group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this arm will be given exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection once a day for 7 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection"]},{"label":"Exosomes placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this arm will be given a placebo of exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection once a day for 7 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: a placebo of exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection","description":"Exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection (3.0ml, protein concentration 1mg/mL).","armGroupLabels":["Exosomes group"],"otherNames":["GD-iExo-003"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"a placebo of exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell for injection","description":"Exosomes placebo, 3.0ml","armGroupLabels":["Exosomes placebo group"],"otherNames":["GD-iExo-003 placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants who experienced dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)","description":"DLTs related to exosome is defined as any of the following: (1) Grade 3-4 infusion-related allergic adverse events consisting of perturbation of cardiovascular, respiratory function, or allergic reactions occurring in the first 24h postinfusion of investigational product; (2) grade 3-4 adverse events through seven days after administration of the last injection; (3) neurologic worsening defined as a 4-point increase in NIHSS compared with baseline NIHSS assessed through seven-days after administration of the last injection; and (4) rate of intracranial hemorrhage.
