However, many private physician practices lack the resources to implement team-based care with pharmacists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a centralized, remote, clinical pharmacy service could improve guideline adherence and secondary measures of cardiovascular risk in primary care offices in rural and small communities.\n\nThis study was a prospective trial in 12 family medicine offices cluster randomized to either the intervention or usual care. The intervention was delivered for 12 months, and subjects had research visits at baseline and 12 months. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines, and secondary outcomes included changes in key cardiovascular risk factors and preventative health measures. We enrolled 302 subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus","Hypertension","Coronary Artery Disease","Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Diabetes","High Blood Pressure","High Cholesterol","Heart Irregularity","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":302,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PHCVRS intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive communication with a clinical pharmacist for 12 months to decrease risk of developing cardiovascular disease.","interventionNames":["Other: PHCVRS Intervention","Other: Personal Health Record"]},{"label":"Usual care/Personal Health Record","type":"OTHER","description":"Will receive usual medical care plus access to an online Personal Health Record, where the participant can document medications and diagnosed conditions.","interventionNames":["Other: Personal Health Record"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"PHCVRS Intervention","description":"A clinical pharmacist at the PHCVRS will follow each participant in the PHCVRS arm for 12 months, including:\n\n1.
