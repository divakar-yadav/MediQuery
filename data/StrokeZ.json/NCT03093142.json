Both the assessor and participants are blinded to all assessments and evaluations. All patients with subacute stroke undergo in-patient or out-patient rehabilitation are screened initially by a series of screening test. Suitable patients are assigned randomly to 3 groups respectively. Group 1 is the combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and neurofeedback group. Group 2 is the neurofeedback group. Group 3 is the control group with sham neurofeedback training.","detailedDescription":"Treatment sessions for all three groups are conducted by the investigators who has training in neurofeedback and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs). Each participant performed 10 training sessions on different days. Sessions were conducted 3-5 times a week The tDCS + neurofeedback group will carry out 30 minutes tDCS and 30 minutes neurofeedback training.\n\nThe real neurofeedback group will carry out 30 minutes neurofeedback training. The sham neurofeedback group will conduct the 30 minutes sham neurofeedback training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs)","neurofeedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS & neurofeedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"30 minutes tDCS \\& 30 minutes neurofeedback","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS & neurofeedback"]},{"label":"real neurofeedback","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"30 minutes real neurofeedback.","interventionNames":["Device: neurofeedback"]},{"label":"sham neurofeedback","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"30 minutes sham neurofeedback.","interventionNames":["Device: sham neurofeedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS & neurofeedback","description":"tDCs and neurofeedback","armGroupLabels":["tDCS & neurofeedback"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"neurofeedback","description":"Neurofeedback","armGroupLabels":["real neurofeedback"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham neurofeedback","description":"sham neurofeedback","armGroupLabels":["sham neurofeedback"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change score in Trail Making Test A & B from baseline","description":"Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching.
