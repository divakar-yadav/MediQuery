Training under less restrictive conditions associated with Task-Related Training (TRT) (auditory feedback from trunk sensor) as compared to stabilized TRT, led to improved functional and impairment measure scores (WMFT, FM and shoulder flexion). Conclusion: Fading feedback with both training methods, during extended TRT reaching/grasping practice generally led to some improvements. However, as demonstrated by impairment and functional outcome measures, using TRT with an auditory feedback signals is a more effective approach than forcing the stabilization of the trunk during rehabilitation of the upper-limb."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["rehabilitation, reaching, stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"stabilization training group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: stabilization training"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"auditory response training group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: auditory training group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"stabilization training","description":"training of arm function with the trunk stabilized","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"auditory training group","description":"response to an auditory signal","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"WMFT","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"FM and shoulder flexion","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals all scored between 20 and 44 on the Upper-Arm subsection of the Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM- Poole \\& Whitney, 1988) and demonstrated some trunk movement during the pretest reaching performance scale measures (RPS, Levin 2006)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals were referred if they had no receptive aphasia, apraxia or other cognitive deficits.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gregory T Thielman, Ed.D","affiliation":"University of the Sciences in Philadelphia","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
