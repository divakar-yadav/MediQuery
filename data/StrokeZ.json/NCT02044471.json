In recent years, tens of thousands of LVADs have been implanted worldwide, with nearly 1,000 at the Texas Heart Institute (THI). Despite the benefits from LVAD therapy, one major weakness is the high frequency of late strokes, reported up to 19%. CF LVADs minimize or remove the pulsatility within the blood system, introducing a new and incompletely understood physiology.\n\nIncreased sympathetic (\"fight or flight\" nervous system) tone secondary to lack of pulse in the blood system can cause high blood pressure, with subsequent hemorrhaging strokes (bleeding into the brain) are one possible explanation for this high adverse event rate in CF LVAD patients. A simple intervention to decrease the increased sympathetic tone is called \"ischemic conditioning\"; a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) is placed on the patient's arm to compress a major artery (ischemia) with subsequent release of the cuff (reperfusion) for set periods of time. This has been shown to reduce blood pressure and major adverse cardiovascular events in other patient populations.\n\nWe plan to conduct a trial to evaluate this intervention, ischemic conditioning, in patients with CF LVADs. We hypothesize that IC will cause a reduction in blood pressure and strokes in this patient population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Heart Failure"],"keywords":["left ventricular assist device","continuous flow","remote ischemic conditioning","hypertension","sympathetic tone","endothelial dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Our intervention will be ischemic conditioning (IC) remotely applied using a sphygmomanometer.

This will be done in the dominant arm, twice daily.\n\nOnce patients are discharged home on a stable pharmacotherapy regimen, they will be expected to follow the above intervention for 6 weeks, followed by another 6 weeks in the control (no intervention) phase.
