Patients will be randomized to one of two groups - a group implanted with a device that allows pairing VNS with rehabilitation and a group that only receives rehabilitation (no implant). Patients have two baseline evaluations, one evaluation after implant but before initiation of treatment, and then six weeks of rehabilitation or rehabilitation + VNS, followed by post acute therapy evaluations at 1, 7, and 30 days after the 6-weeks of treatment. The intent is to assess safety and provide preliminary effectiveness information for VNS for upper limb functional improvement after stroke. Implanted patients may receive longer-term treatment and follow-up after the acute study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper","Limb","Deficits","Rehabilitation","VNS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VNS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"VNS (vagus nerve stimulation) paired with rehabilitation as provided by the Vivistim System.","interventionNames":["Device: Vivistim System"]},{"label":"Rehab Only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Rehabilitation only (no implant, no VNS)","interventionNames":["Other: Rehab Only"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Vivistim System","description":"The Vivistim System provides vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with rehabilitation movements.","armGroupLabels":["VNS"],"otherNames":["VNS, vagus nerve stimulation, paired VNS"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehab Only","description":"Rehabilitation without device implant and VNS","armGroupLabels":["Rehab Only"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety","description":"Assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events.","timeFrame":"6-weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Major Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
