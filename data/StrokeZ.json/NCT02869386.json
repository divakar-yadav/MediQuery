Preliminary analyses suggest cost-effectiveness. However, scientific proof of improved functional outcome compared to usual care is still lacking. The objective of this trial is to show improved functional outcomes after deployment of the Stroke Emergency Mobile (STEMO) compared to regular care.","detailedDescription":"This is a pragmatic, prospective, multi-center trial with blinded outcome assessment of treatment candidates three months after stroke. Treatment candidates will be defined as patients with final discharge diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, and onset-to-alarm time ≤4 hours, symptoms not resolved at time of ambulance arrival, and able to walk without assistance prior to emergency. These patients will be included if their emergency call from a predefined catchment area in Berlin, Germany, caused a stroke alarm at the dispatch center during STEMO hours (7am-11pm, Monday-Sunday). About 45% of STEMO dispatches will be handled by regular ambulances since STEMO will be already in operation creating the quasi-randomized control group.\n\nB_PROUD uses data from the B-SPATIAL registry. The B-SPATIAL registry has started recruitment in January 2016. However, B_PROUD recruits patients with symptom onset October 1st, 2016 or later (because data access at the dispatch center had to be established first)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","prehospital","telemedicine","thrombolysis","thrombectomy","endovascular treatment","functional outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"STEMO deployment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"STEMO is a specialized stroke ambulance providing prehospital neurovascular expertise, a CT scanner, point-of-care testing, and telemedical support.","interventionNames":["Procedure: STEMO"]},{"label":"Regular care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Regular prehospital care consists of an ambulance.
