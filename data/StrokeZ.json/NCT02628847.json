The primary outcome is motor recovery at one and three months.","detailedDescription":"Individuals who are within 4-10 days post ischemic stroke with arm hemiparesis or hemiplegia who are admitted to inpatient rehabilitation are randomized to receive either sildenafil citrate (25 mg once per day) or placebo for 14 days. These individuals receive usual rehabilitation and medical care. Primary outcomes are motor skills and walking speed at one and three months.\n\nIf willing and able, participants undergo an MRI to measure the integrity of the white matter pathways in the motor system using diffusion tensor imaging. Repeat MRIs are obtained at one and three months. The investigators will examine if such white matter integrity predicts response to the drug and if the drug facilitates changes in white matter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","motor skills","sildenafil citrate","White
