It is still undefined whether combination therapy of Ticagrelor and Aspirin is more effective than Clopidogrel and aspirin for minor stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary purpose of the PRINCE trial is to evaluate the anti-platelet effects of a 3-month regimen of ticagrelor initiated with 180 mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice/day combined with aspirin 100 mg/day during first 21 days versus a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel initiated with 300 mg loading dose of followed by 75 mg/day combined with aspirin 100 mg/day during first 21 days when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in high-risk transient ischemic attack or minor stroke.","detailedDescription":"The PRINCE trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-centre, open-label, active-controlled, blinded-endpoint trial (a PROBE design concerning clinical trial). A total of approximately 952 patients (40years≤Age\\<80years) with high-risk TIA (defined as an ABCD2 score ≥ 4 or the stenosis of offending vessel ≥ 50%) or minor ischemic stroke (defined as an NIHSS ≤ 3), who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom onset will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor on the day of randomization, followed by 90 mg twice/day ticagrelor from Day 2 to 3 months; 2) the other group will receive a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel on the day of randomization, followed by 75 mg once/day clopidogrel from Day 2 to 3 months. Aspirin will be given in a total dose of 100-300 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once/day from Day 2 to Day 21 in the both groups. The primary objective is to assess the anti-platelet effects of Ticagrelor combined with Aspirin versus Clopidogrel combined with Aspirin in Chinese patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke. The study consists of six visits including the day of randomization, 2 hours after the first anti-platelet agents, 24 hours after the first anti-platelet agents, Day 7+2days, Day 21±2days and Day 90±7days. Genomic DNA of all patients will be collected for genotyped. And the genetic variants affecting Clopidogrel metabolism will be analyzed. The antiplatelet effects will be analyzed in total subjects and genetic variants carriers. The trial is anticipated to complete in 18 months from the first subject recruitment , with 952 subjects recruited from 25 centres in China. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by IRB(Institutional Review Board) /EC(Ethics Committee) in Beijing Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Attack, Transient"],"keywords":["minor stroke","transient ischemic attack","ticagrelor","clopidogrel","dual anti-platelet therapy","platelet reactivity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":675,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ticagrelor/ASA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drugs: Ticagrelor and Acetylsalicylic acid.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ticagrelor and Acetylsalicylic acid"]},{"label":"Clopidogrel/ASA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Drugs: Clopidogrel and Acetylsalicylic acid.","interventionNames":["Drug: Clopidogrel and Acetylsalicylic acid"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ticagrelor and Acetylsalicylic acid","description":"This group will receive a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor on the day of randomization, followed by 90 mg twice/day ticagrelor from Day 2 to 3 months; combined with Aspirin given in a total dose of 100-300 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once/day from Day 2 to Day 21.","armGroupLabels":["Ticagrelor/ASA"],"otherNames":["BRILINTA","Aspirin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Clopidogrel and Acetylsalicylic acid","description":"This group will receive a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel on the day of randomization, followed by 75 mg once/day clopidogrel from Day 2 to 3 months; combined with Aspirin given in a total dose of 100-300 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once/day from Day 2 to Day 21.","armGroupLabels":["Clopidogrel/ASA"],"otherNames":["Plavix","Aspirin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HOPR) defined as P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU)> 208 measured by VerifyNow® assay at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"HOPR at 90 days in subjects carrying genetic variants which affected Clopidogrel metabolism.","description":"HOPR defined as P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU)\\> 208 measured by VerifyNow® assay","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"New vascular events defined as any event of the following: Any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage).","description":"All the new vascular events will be assessed by at least two neurologists based on neuroimaging and clinical feature.
