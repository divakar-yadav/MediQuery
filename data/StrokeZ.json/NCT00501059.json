The current study is designed to prove the efficacy and tolerability of 100 mg enteric-coated Aspirin versus placebo in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, which include fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal and nonfatal stroke and CV death, in a population with no history of known CVD who are at moderate risk of major CHD events (approximately 10-20% 10 year CHD risk). This corresponds to a patient population mean 10-year CVD risk of approximately 30%. Subjects are treated in a standard care setting and may receive treatment for the underlying risk factors as defined by the treating physician. Outcome events will be adjudicated by an Endpoint Adjudication Committee and the study will be monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board.","detailedDescription":"Summary of substantial Protocol amendments\n\nAmendment #2 from 09-APR-2008:\n\n* Systolic blood pressure (SBP) limit of 170 mmHg has been added to the exclusion criteria\n* Exclusion of patients currently taking anticoagulant medication\n* A longer interval between the daily dose of study drug and ibuprofen\n* Revised wording in moderate risk definitions for coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD): \"To evaluate the clinical effects of a 100 mg/day enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid versus placebo in the reduction of CVD events in patients at moderate risk of major CHD events (approximately 10 to 20% 10-year CHD risk; approximately 20 to 30% 10-year risk of CVD).
