Moreover, repetitive movement practice seems to be crucial for maximizing therapeutic benefits.\n\nRecent studies, proposed an engineered glove to assess motor performance during finger-to-thumb opposition movements and to provide objective and reproducible measures.\n\nThe same tool can be integrated with Virtual Reality and serious games to provide repetitive practice of activities improving motivation and adherence with therapy.\n\nthe investigators developed a new integrated glove and virtual reality to facilitate the recovery of hand functionality.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the engineered glove in the assessment and treatment of hand dysfunction in people with Stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hand Grasp"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each subject will perform a variety of VR exercises to reduce impairments in their finger range of motion, speed and strength.\n\nIt includes a glove-shaped sensor device and a software application.","interventionNames":["Other: experimental group"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Each subject will perform usual care rehabilitation aimed at improving manual dexterity","interventionNames":["Other: control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"experimental group","description":"Each subject will undergo 10 rehabilitation sessions 2-3 times a week, lasting around 30'.","armGroupLabels":["experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"control group","description":"Each subject will undergo 10 rehabilitation sessions 2-3 times a week, lasting around 30'.","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Box and Blocks Test","description":"Block and Box Test assesses grasp and transport and upper limb functional disorders and measures unilateral gross manual dexterity.","timeFrame":"baseline- immediately after the intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in 9-Hole Peg Test","description":"It measures finger dexterity.
