In symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis grater than 70% the Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) reduces stroke risk by about 75% and is generally accepted as being cost effective. However also in these cases there is a part of the population that, according to the morphological plaque characteristics, could better benefit from a conservative medical treatment.\n\nImproving the Best Medical Treatment, the situation seems to be even less clear in asymptomatic patients, where probably it would need to treat at least 32 patients in order to prevent one single ictus.\n\nDifferent parameters have been considered in order to determine, among the asymptomatic patients the ones that more than others could benefit from a surgical revascularisation instead of a medical treatment.\n\nBetween these parameters, the quality of the plaque (vulnerability) and the micro-embolic signals (MES) detection with the Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Holter seems to be the most relevant.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is trying to establish whether plaques can determine a different embolic risk in relation to the different histological findings.\n\nTherefore, it seems interesting and reasonable trying to establish a correlation between these two parameters in asymptomatic patients as in the symptomatic ones in order to make more and more appropriate a surgical plaque removal according to the specific risk of each patient in a set of tailored surgery.\n\nIt consists in a descriptive observational study, since it intends to describe the embolic signals detection (MES) counted in automatic way with the TCD Holter, in patients affected by carotid stenosis, before and after the surgical operation.\n\nIn particular it consists in a monocentric, longitudinal, prospective cohort study since it intends to analyse a group of patients (already candidates to CEA) that experiences a specific event (MES) before and after the surgical plaque removal, in a precise span of time.\n\nSince the treatment, removing the plaque, should remove the embolic focus too, a significant reduction of microembolic signals in post-operative time is expected.\n\nThis reduction has been esteemed around about the 70% among candidates to CEA. Patients taken on responsibility of the equipe will undergo an ultrasonographic investigation for the carotid stenosis, histological characterization of the plaque based on the Gray-Weale classification and TCD-Holter for MES."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Stenosis","Carotid Artery Diseases","Carotid Atherosclerosis","Carotid Artery Plaque","TCD","Stroke"],"keywords":["carotid","carotid stenosis","plaque","stroke risk","transcranial doppler","TCD","histology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"carotid plaque"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MES COUNT","description":"number of MES","timeFrame":"before surgery"},{"measure":"MES COUNT","description":"number of MES","timeFrame":"24 hours after surgery"},{"measure":"MES COUNT","description":"number of MES","timeFrame":"after 30 days from the surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RISK RATE","description":"Estimate an association between MES count and plaque's histology","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 60 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Informed consent signed\n* Age\\>18y.o.\n* Carotid stenosis \\>70% and/or vulnerable plaque\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to give the informed consent\n* Age\\<18y.o.\n* Carotid stenosis \\< 70 %\n* Patients already treated with CEA in the same seat\n* Impossibility to find the insonation window\n* Patients not in best medical treatment therapy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We selected patients already got in touch with the hospital, already put in list for a carotid surgical revascularization.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Roberto Moratto, Dr","affiliation":"AOU Modena e Reggio Emilia","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"OCB Baggiovara, AOU Modena","city":"Modena","zip":"41126","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.64783,"lon":10.92539}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36243263","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Pizzarelli G, Gennai S, Leone N, Covic T, Moratto R, Silingardi R.
