These drugs are usually stopped when the brain haemorrhage occurs.\n\nBut when patients recover from brain haemorrhage, they and their doctors are often uncertain about whether to restart these drugs to prevent further clots occurring, or whether to avoid them in case they increase the risk of brain haemorrhage happening again.\n\nIn this preliminary study of 292 such people who survive a brain haemorrhage, we will study the potentially beneficial effects of three antiplatelet drugs (one or more of aspirin, clopidogrel, or dipyridamole, chosen by the patient's physician) on the risks of heart attack, stroke and other clotting problems as well as their effect on the risk of a brain haemorrhage happening again."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["stroke","intracranial hemorrhage","intracerebral hemorrhage","antithrombotic drugs","brain microbleeds"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Start antiplatelet drug(s)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"If the patient is randomized in this arm, an antiplatelet agent (aspirin or clopidogrel or dypyridamole), chosen by the patient's physician before the randomisation, will be prescribed to the patient during the study period","interventionNames":["Drug: Clopidogrel or Aspirin and/or Dypyridamole"]},{"label":"Avoid antiplatelet drug(s)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"If the patient is randomized in this arm, antiplatelet drugs will not be prescribed to the patient during the entire study period"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Clopidogrel or Aspirin and/or Dypyridamole","description":"The physician will prescribe on this antiplatelet agent if the patient is randomized in the arm \" restart\"","armGroupLabels":["Start antiplatelet drug(s)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","description":"Occurrence of a fatal or non-fatal symptomatic ICH proven radiologically at follow-up ( brain CT or MRI) .","timeFrame":"at one year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"serious fatal vascular events (i.e. followed by death within 30 days ) or non- fatal","description":"symptomatic hemorrhagic events, symptomatic ischemic events, stroke of undetermined nature","timeFrame":"at one year and at the end of follow-up (2 years)"},{"measure":"Other fatal events","description":"Death without pre-defined vascular cause","timeFrame":"at one year and at the end of follow-up (2 years)"},{"measure":"Rankin Scale","description":"modified Rankin Scale: dichotomized mRS 0-1-2 (no dependency) versus 3 or more (dependency or death)","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient age ≥18 years.\n* Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage confirmed by imaging\n* Patient had been taken antithrombotic drug(s) for the prevention of vaso-occlusive disease for at least 1 week before ICH onset\n* Randomisation more than 24 hours after ICH onset.\n* Patient and their doctor are uncertain about whether to start or avoid antiplatelet drugs.\n* Brain imaging that first diagnosed the ICH is available.
