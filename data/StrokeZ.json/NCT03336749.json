Few studies have evaluated if sensory re-learning in combination with task-specific training can improve the ability to perform daily hand activities and perceived participation. Therefore, there is a need for more studies. This is a single-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms. Thirty persons with sensory impairments of the UL after stroke will be recruited and randomized to either sensory re-learning in combination with task-specific training or to task-specific training only. The training will consist of 2.5 hours of group training per session, 2 times per week for 5 weeks. Assessments will be conducted pre- and post-training and at 3 months' after the intervention.\n\nDescriptive statistics (mean (SD) or median (min- max) will be used to characterize the study groups. Non-parametric statistics will be used for ordinal data and parametric statistics for continues data. To analyze between group differences, the Mann-Whitney test or Independent sample t-test will be used and Wilcoxon signed ranks test or paired t-test to analyze within group differences. The level of statistical significance will be set at p \\< 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, upper limb, sensory training, rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants are assigned to one of two or more groups in parallel for the duration of the study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessors are blinded to the participants' group allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sensory re-learning in combination with task-specific training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sensory group"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Traditional task-specific training","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sensory group","description":"The sensory re-learning consists of touch detection practice, i.e., touch discrimination to identify different materials, shapes, textures, weights and temperatures, proprioception and tactile object recognition in combination with task-specific training.","armGroupLabels":["Sensory group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"Traditional task-specific training","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Semmes- Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test from baseline to post intervention and from baseline to 3 month follow-up.","description":"Assess touch detection thresholds of the hand and fingers.
