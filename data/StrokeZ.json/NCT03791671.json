In the rehabilitation of stroke patients should be compared whether individual balance training has a greater effect than group balance training. The result is determined based on the walking speed.","detailedDescription":"The RehaClinic Kilchberg is a neurological rehabilitation facility with the phases B-D. Between February and the end of March, out of 78 patients, 71% of the patients had a stroke. Therefore, my choice of topic for the Master's thesis fell on balance training of patients after a stroke. The duration of the study is based on the timetable for the Master's thesis. Initially, 20 stroke patients will be recruited. When the number is reached, the study is completed to begin descriptive statistics and analyze potential BIAS.\n\nDeficits in the vestibular, visual, motor, and / or somatosensory systems lead to falls in the first 6 months after the stroke. This affects approximately 46% of patients. But also cognitive processes, such as attention and concentration. Therefore, the treatment must be adapted to the respective strategy of the patient. If the patient increasingly uses the visual system, the therapy has to work a lot with the eyes closed. In turn, if he uses more of the sensorimotor system is increasingly trained with unstable documents. After this system, the balance program was set up. It is the same for the intervention and control group to make a difference between individual and group training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Balance training","Gait Speed"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"There will be a intervention group and a control group.

The BBS detects deficits at both activity and body function levels. It consists of 14 items. Some items require that the patient maintains positions of increasing difficulty, from sitting to standing on one leg. Other items evaluate the ability to perform specific tasks, such as reaching forward, turning around and picking up an object from the floor. Scoring is based on the ability to meet certain time or distance requirements and to perform the items independently. Scaling takes place from 0 points (not possible) to 4 points (independently possible). This results in a total score of 56 points. The cut-off is at 45 points.","timeFrame":"Measurement one day before and one day after the three weeks intervention time, Data analysis through study completion"},{"measure":"Change of the Walking ability (walking aid) at three weeks","description":"Functional Ambulation categories - is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. To use the FAC, an assessor asks the subject various questions and briefly observes their walking ability to provide a rating from 0 to 5. A score of 0 indicates that the patient is a non-functional ambulator (cannot walk); A score of 1, 2 or 3 denotes a dependent ambulator who requires assistance from another person in the form of continuous manual contact (1), continuous or intermittent manual contact (2), or verbal supervision/guarding (3). A score of 4 or 5 describes an independent ambulator who can walk freely on: level surfaces only (4) or any surface (5=maximum score).","timeFrame":"Measurement one day before and one day after the three weeks intervention time, Data analysis through study completion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke starting from Rehabilitation phase B\n* ability to understand therapy instructions\n* walkable with aids\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neurodegenerative disease\n* non-stroke dizziness\n* cardiopulmonary insufficiency\n* polyneuropathy\n* peripheral vascular disease","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yvonne Teuschl, Ass.-Prof.","affiliation":"Donauuniversit√§t Krems (Danube University)","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"RehaClinic Kilchberg","city":"Kilchberg","state":"Zurich","zip":"8802","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.32438,"lon":8.54548}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"RehaClinic AG","url":"http://www.rehaclinic.ch"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"documentSection":{"largeDocumentModule":{"largeDocs":[{"typeAbbrev":"Prot_SAP","hasProtocol":true,"hasSap":true,"hasIcf":false,"label":"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan","date":"2018-11-20","uploadDate":"2018-12-28T06:30","filename":"Prot_SAP_000.pdf","size":1779563},{"typeAbbrev":"ICF","hasProtocol":false,"hasSap":false,"hasIcf":true,"label":"Informed Consent Form","date":"2018-11-20","uploadDate":"2018-12-28T06:31","filename":"ICF_001.pdf","size":1467057}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
