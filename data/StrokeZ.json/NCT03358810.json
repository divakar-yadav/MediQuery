All patients will have the Phagenyx® Catheter placed prior to randomization, and will receive either an active treatment of Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) or a sham treatment performed by a health care professional (HCP) that is un-blinded to treatment assignment. All other speech pathology standard dysphagia care will be provided by a speech language pathologist (SLP) that is blinded to treatment assignment. Administration of all protocol-specific assessments will be conducted by personnel blinded to treatment assignment.\n\nThe study will follow an adaptive group sequential design with unblinded sample size re-assessment. To ensure 180 evaluable patients with 7-day data and assuming a 20% dropout rate, 225 patients will be enrolled initially. An interim analysis for futility will occur after the first 60 patients complete their 7-day visits and another interim analysis will be performed for efficacy and futility after 120 patients complete their 7-day visits. The total sample size may be increased up to 338 patients after the second interim analysis to ensure up to 270 evaluable patients. Up to 15 investigational centers across the US and possibly Europe will participate in this study. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately 24 months and patient participation will last for approximately 11 weeks. Patients will be assessed at the following intervals: baseline, 48 hours, 7 days, 14 days or at discharge, whichever is first, and 11 weeks after completion of the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia Following Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients randomized to receive active PES","interventionNames":["Device: PES"]},{"label":"Sham treatmment","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomized to sham will not receive any PES.","interventionNames":["Device: PES"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"PES","description":"The PES system is a two-part neurostimulation system.
