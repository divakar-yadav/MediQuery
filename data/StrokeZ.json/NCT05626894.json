The Intervention group will use StrokeWear system in combination to a motor and behavioral home intervention whereas the Control group will follow usual care which consists of a home-exercise plan (HEP).\n\nStudy participants will be asked to take part in 4 evaluation study visits: one screening and enrollment visit, and three evaluation visits (at baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months - at the intervention completion). Subject upper-extremity motor function will be assessed across domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model. Groups will be stratified by baseline motor impairment and stroke chronicity.\n\nSubjects randomized to the intervention group will take part of weekly coaching sessions during the first month, bi-weekly sessions during the months 2 and 3, and monthly sessions during months 4-6. These sessions will be held in-person or remotely, based on the study participant preference.\n\nSubjects randomized to the control group will take part of monthly visits, held in-person or remotely (based on study participant preference), to re-evaluate the home-exercise plan and prescribe an update list of exercises for the following month."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Sequelae","Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA"],"keywords":["StrokeWear","BioSensics","Behavioral intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"StrokeWear Motor and Behavioral Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Combination Product: StrokeWear Motor and Behavioral Intervention"]},{"label":"Usual Care","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Usual Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"StrokeWear Motor and Behavioral Intervention","description":"The intervention will consist of 1) the use of StrokeWear for goal directed movements (GDM) feedback and goal setting, 2) use of daily activity action planning (DAAP) to foster planned hemiparetic UE use during daily activities in the home and community, and 3) patient empowerment.
