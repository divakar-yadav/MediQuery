Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation feature that can control the spasticity through reciprocal inhibition, muscle relaxation and sensory stimulation. The goal will be to evaluate and compare the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation when applied in the agonist and antagonist muscles of spastic hemiparetic patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["spastic hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1 (G1) NMES is applied in the spastic antagonist muscle","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The parameters considered for the application of NMES are: frequency of 50Hz, the wavelength of 350m / s, 10 seconds of contraction of 20 seconds of rest to total 15 minutes.
