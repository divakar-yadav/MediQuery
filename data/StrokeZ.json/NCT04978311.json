Most stroke survivors suffer from arm paresis even in the chronic phase. There is a need to develop novel strategies to augment therapeutic efficacy in stroke rehabilitation. One potential method to enhance treatment efficacy is through the \"priming\" technique. Among all priming techniques, mirror therapy (MT) has been proposed to be a promising method to augment effects of motor re-training. The investigators propose a 3-year research project to determine the effects of MT-priming on augmenting stroke interventions. The investigators select two types of evidence-based neurorehabilitation, the task-specific training and the impairment-oriented training, to be primed by MT based on their unique treatment benefits on restoring arm ability. In addition, the investigators will provide customized home practice corresponding to each type of interventions. Specifically, the investigators will (1) examine immediate and long-term effects of MT priming with task-specific training versus MT-priming with impairment-oriented training, relative to a dose-matched control therapy on motor function, arm activities, quality of life, etc; (2) provide comprehensive evaluations based on the ICF model to identify the specific benefits of MT-priming regimens; and (3) explore demographic and clinical characteristics of participants that may predict treatment outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror therapy (MT) priming with task-specific training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the regimen, participants will perform MT first followed by task-specific training.
