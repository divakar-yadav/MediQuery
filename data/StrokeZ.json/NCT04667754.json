The aim of the current study is to pilot a tailored ICBT program developed through a patient oriented approach to improve overall wellbeing among those with stroke living in the community.","detailedDescription":"Background: Individuals with stroke can experience high levels of emotional distress leading to decreased quality of life and increased health care costs. Though mental health problems are prevalent and disabling, they often go untreated for various reasons, such as access to specialized care, rural and remote location, lack of time, or concerns about stigma related to seeking care. Internet delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) overcomes barriers to face-to-face therapy by often reaching a much wider group of patients who experience unequal access to health care. The internet based program is based on cognitive behaviour therapy, which is an evidenced-based treatment that helps patients identify and modify thoughts and behaviours that contribute to their mental health concerns. ICBT has been shown to be effective in improving psychosocial outcomes such as depression and anxiety, along with disability and quality of life among persons with chronic health conditions.\n\nRationale: Despite evidence for ICBT among those with other chronic conditions, its efficacy has yet to be evaluated among those with neurological conditions, including stroke.\n\nObjective: The aim of the current study is to pilot an ICBT program developed through a patient oriented approach to improve overall wellbeing among those with stroke\n\nMethods: In this project, an ICBT program for those with stroke developed through a patient oriented approach will be piloted amongst a small group of participants (n=20) to examine acceptability, feasibility, and limited efficacy. At the end of the program, participants will be asked to complete a brief semi-structured interview examining barriers and facilitators to the ICBT program. Participant feedback from the interviews will be used to further improve the ICBT program to meet the needs of the population. The results from the study will be used to guide larger studies to evaluate effectiveness of the program in a community setting.\n\nAnticipated Impact: Ultimately, the proposed project aims to improve overall wellbeing and access to health care service for those who have experienced stroke and mental health concerns."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy","Depression","Anxiety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"10 week ICBT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CBT provides online structured self-help modules over several months based on the principles of CBT in combination with weekly guidance through emails and telephone calls.
