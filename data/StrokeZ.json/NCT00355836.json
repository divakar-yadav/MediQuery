Many patients (41-45%) experience chronic motor impairments (Dijkerman et al., 1996) and limitations in activities of daily living (Wade \\& Langton Hewer, 1987) even after extensive neurological rehabilitation. They often result in long-term dependence at a considerable cost to the carers and the health service. It is therefore crucial to optimise motor recovery after stroke. This study investigates the therapeutic benefits of motor imagery training in stroke patients with a motor weakness.\n\nEvidence for the idea that motor imagery training could enhance the recovery of hand function comes from several separate bases of evidence: the sports literature; neurophysiological evidence; evidence from health psychology research; as well as preliminary findings using motor imagery techniques in stroke patients.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that mental rehearsal of movement can produce effects normally attributed to practising the actual movements. Imagining hand movements could stimulate the redistribution of brain activity, which accompanies recovery of hand function, thus resulting in a reduced motor deficit. Patients are assessed before and after a four-week evaluation period. In this randomised controlled trial 45 patients daily mentally rehearse movements with their affected hand under close supervision. Their recovery is compared to 45 patients who perform closely supervised non-motor mental rehearsal, and 45 patients who are not engaged in a training program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Motor Imagery","Stroke","Neuro-rehabilitation","health psychology","neuroscience","randomised controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":135,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Mental Imagery"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) (Lyle, 1981)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Grip strength (dynamometer; Heller et al., 1987),"},{"measure":"Nine hole pegboard task (Mathiowetz et al., 1985, Wade [ref]),"},{"measure":"Function Limitation Profile"},{"measure":"Barthel Index"},{"measure":"Recovery Locus of Control"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nConfirmed diagnosis of stroke in the last 1-6 months Persisting upper limb weakness -\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAlcohol/ Drug abuse Psychiatric history Previous illness that has impacted on individuals Activity of Daily living\n\n- Dementia (assessed by MSQ) Severe Aphasia","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Marie Johnston, Prof","affiliation":"University of Aberdeen","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Aberdeen","city":"Aberdeen","zip":"AB24 3FX","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":57.14369,"lon":-2.09814}},{"facility":"Ninewells Hospital","city":"Dundee","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":56.46913,"lon":-2.97489}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
