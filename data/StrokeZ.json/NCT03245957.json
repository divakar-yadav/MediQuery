MPO could be a examined as a potent marker of early stage of ischemic stroke.\n\nPlasma MPO levels could also be discriminant regarding the mimick strokes in patient exhibiting stroke clinical picture."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":112,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke diagnosed by MRI or CT scan","interventionNames":["Other: Ischemic stroke"]},{"label":"Haemorrhagic stroke","description":"Patients without haemorrhagic stroke diagnosed by MRI or CT scan","interventionNames":["Other: Haemorrhagic stroke"]},{"label":"Mimick stroke","description":"Patients without haemorrhagic or ischemic stroke diagnosed by MRI or CT scan"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ischemic stroke","description":"Patients with acute stage of stroke clinical picture, with ischemic, haemorrhagic or mimick stroke diagnosed using MRI or CT scan","armGroupLabels":["Ischemic stroke"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Haemorrhagic stroke","description":"Patients with acute stage of stroke clinical picture, with ischemic, haemorrhagic or mimick stroke diagnosed using MRI or CT scan","armGroupLabels":["Haemorrhagic stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Plasma MPO concentrations","description":"Assessment of plasma MPO concentrations during acute stage of stroke","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 6 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"HDL-MPO concentrations","description":"Assessment of HDL-MPO concentrations during acute stage of stroke","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 6 hours"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"HDL dysfunction","description":"Assessment of HDL function using inhibition test on cell culture","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 6 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients with less than 12 hours stroke clinical signs:\n\n* hemiparesis or hemiplegia\n* unilateral sensitivity disorder\n* language impairment\n* balance disorder\n* dizziness, bilateral or monocular vision totally or partially lost\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy\n* head trauma since the last 3 months\n* stroke since the last 3 months\n* myocardial infarction since the last 3 months\n* patient disagrees to be enrolled in the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult patients with clinical picture of early stage of stroke with the first signed lasting for less than 12 hours","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Christine JUHEL, PHD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+262262359949","email":"christine.juhel@chu-reunion.fr"},{"name":"David COURET, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+262262359000","email":"david.couret@chu-reunion.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"David COURET, MD","affiliation":"Centre Hpospitalier Universitaire de La REUNION","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chu Reunion Island","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Saint-Pierre","state":"Reunion Island","zip":"97410","country":"Réunion","contacts":[{"name":"COURET DAVID, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+262262359000","email":"david.couret@chu-reunion.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-21.3393,"lon":55.47811}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
