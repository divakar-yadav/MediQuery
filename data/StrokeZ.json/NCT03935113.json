The Kinesio taping effect is to facilitate the muscle activity of upper limb. This program is intended to provide a treatment for patients with chronic stroke, and to observe their upper limb movements before and after using the Kinesio taping.","detailedDescription":"Motor impairment is the main cause of disability after stroke, leading to major health problems. Research has shown that the most common consequence of stroke is the paresis of limbs.The ability to live independently after a stroke depends on the recovery of motor functions,particularly those of the upper limb.The core concept of the Kinesio taping is to influence the brain through the sensory input, stimulate the nervous system, and improve the motor performance of the stroke patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"KT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The paretic upper limb is a common consequence of stroke that increases activity limitation.","interventionNames":["Other: Kinesio taping"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Kinesio taping","description":"In KT group, KT was applied using the insertion-origin muscle and space-correction technique of affected upper limb with stroke patients.","armGroupLabels":["KT group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) from pre to post-intervention.","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
