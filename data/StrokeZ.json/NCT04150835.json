The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Xingnaojing will improve the daily living ability of acute ischemic stroke at 90 days. Xingnaojing will be compared to placebo, combined with guidelines-based standard care in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset. All participants will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)entry score of 4-25. Participants who have planned or already received the intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment will be excluded.
