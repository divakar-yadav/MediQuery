The investigators assume, that the success rate and safety of LAAC procedures is not reduced using unimodal preoperative imaging.\n\nRegarding to postoperative imaging, the investigators aim to compare the sensitivity of different imaging techniques in detecting postoperative complications. We assume, that multimodal imaging technique increases the accuracy and sensitivity of the detection of postoperative complications (PDL, device thrombi).","detailedDescription":"Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is an increasingly used non-pharmacologic strategy to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who have absolute or relative contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulant therapy, mainly due to previous major bleeding or high bleeding risk. As the majority of candidates are elderly patients with multiple morbidities, the reduction of procedural burden is of huge significance.\n\nThe aim of the present prospective, randomized, single-centre study is to examine the non-inferiority of unimodal (MDCT) vs. multimodal (MDCT+TOE) preprocedural imaging in percutaneous left atrial appendage closure. The investigators are going to assess the success rate, safety and complications of LAAC procedures, and determine the procedural burden (total radiation dose, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, contrast amount) of the interventions after preprocedural unimodal and multimodal appendage characterization and device sizing. Multimodal procedural guidance (2D/3D TOE, fluoroscopy-angiography) and multimodal postprocedural imaging (2D/3D TOE, MDCT) is going to be used to identify complications (peri-device leak, thrombus). The investigators are planning to compare the accuracy and additive value of different postoperative imaging techniques.\n\n."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial
