In the risk factors of stroke, carotid atherosclerosis have higher incidence.As the only visible microvessels in vivo, retinal can provides an accurate window into cerebrovascular and systemic vascular conditions. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and electroretinogram (ERG) can be used to quantitatively analyze the retinal structure and function in patients with ischemic stroke, and find out the valuable parameters. Electroencephalogram(EEG) can collect the electrical activity of cerebral cortex in patients with ischemic stroke and find the correlation between EEG and ERG. Finally, it is of great significance to establish a non-invasive, more objective, convenient and safe risk prediction model for stroke in combination with carotid atherosclerosis, retinal structural and functional parameters and EEG.","detailedDescription":"Firstly, this study will cross sectional analyze the retinal structure and function of patients with ischemic stroke to find the closely related parameters. Secondly, based on the results of cross section analysis, a cohort study will be established to build a risk prediction model for stroke combining carotid atherosclerosis, retinal structure and function parameters and EEG."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","retinal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ischemic stroke","description":"According to diagnostic criteria"},{"label":"healthy control","description":"without any retinal diseases"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)","description":"Quantitatively analyzing the retinal microcirculation and structure in patients with ischemic stroke by using OCTA.","timeFrame":"1year"},{"measure":"Electroretinogram (ERG)","description":"The amplitude(μV) and implicit time(ms) of a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potentials in dark-adapted and light-adapted.","timeFrame":"1year"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Electroencephalogram(EEG)","description":"Collecting the electrical activity of cerebral cortex in patients with ischemic stroke, including the electroencephalogram frequency(Hz) and amplitude(μV) of δ-wave, θ-wave, α-wave and β-wave.
