The specific objective is to test the performance and effectiveness of a custom electronic health record (EHR)-based notification module at time of index hospitalization and at follow-up for hemorrhagic stroke survivors, before disparities in access to outpatient care may limit opportunities to intervene.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that notification of health care providers through the EHR will increase measurements of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and glycated hemoglogbin A1c (HbA1c) and increase evaluation and management rates for obstructive sleep apnea and hearing impairment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Electronic Health Record Notification","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For eligible patients presenting with an acute hemorrhagic stroke, a recommendation to measure low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) together with their last measurement dates will be displayed in the patient's electronic health record through a best practice alert (BPA). The alert will display for the patient's provider when they first open the patient's chart. The provider may accept the automatically generated orders for both measurements displayed in the BPA, may modify one or both of the orders, or choose to dismiss the BPA.\n\nFor patients that follow-up with the out-patient stroke clinic and received the in-patient intervention, a second BPA will suggest referrals to sleep study and audiology. The alert will display for the patient's provider when they first open the patient's chart.
