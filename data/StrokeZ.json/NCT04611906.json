Such knowledge may improve the understanding of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) mechanism, define pharmacological therapy and suggest treatment target.","detailedDescription":"Around 68 patients who have acute cerebral ischemic symptoms attributed by cSVD will be recruited. Stroke etiology will be determined by Neurologists based on clinical syndrome, vascular imaging features and concurrent cardiovascular risks. The time window for recruitment is 4 weeks from the qualifying stroke.\n\nAfter an informed consent for the study, potential candidates will undergo a cranial MRI and MR angiography. Patients who are found to have acute or subacute lacunar infarcts (defined as an infarct diameter \\< 15mm) in the territories supplied by the lateral lenticulostriate arteries, i.e. internal capsule, putamen, external capsular or corona radiata, will proceed to a 3-Dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) at baseline and in 12 months. All recruited patients will receive single antiplatelet agents and statin. Their cognition, mobility and treat cardiovascular risk factors based on 4 pre-specified goals (as elaborated in Study Procedures) will also be regularly reviewed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke","Small Vessel Cerebrovascular Disease","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","small vessel disease","3D-rotational Angiography","Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patient","description":"Patients who have acute cerebral ischemic symptoms attributed by cSVD can be recruited into this study.
