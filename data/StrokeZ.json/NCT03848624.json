All assessment items are either scoring \"full\", \"partial\", or \"none\" functionality in the affected side, which minimizes ceiling and floor effects. FMA-LE demonstrated high internal consistency and a reliable assessment tool for a group of 140 hemiplegic community dwelling patients (Park \\& Choi, 2014).","timeFrame":"Three months after the last training session"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 Minute Walk Test","description":"Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT), measures the maximum walking distance covered in fixed duration as a sub-maximal test of endurance and aerobic capacity. The measurement of 6MWT is highly correlated to FAC (Mehrholz, et al., 2007) with good reliability (ICC=0.94-0.96) (Steffen, Hacker \\& Mollinger, 2002).","timeFrame":"Three months after the last training session"},{"measure":"Timed 10-meter Walk Test","description":"Timed 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT), measures comfortable and fast walking speeds in short distance. The ability to increase walking speed above a comfortable pace suggests the capability to adapt to varying environments, such as crossing street, with high reliability (ICC=0.90-0.96) (Flansbjer, et al., 2005). Average walking speed of healthy elderly subjects ranges in 0.6m/s-1.4m/s, and can increase to 21%-56% above the comfortable pace for faster walking speed.","timeFrame":"Three months after the last training session"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"Berg Balance Scale (BBS), consists of 56-level measures to examine balance ability and to predict falling risk with high reliability (ICC=0.98) (Steffen, Hacker \\& Mollinger, 2002). Stroke patients were assessed based on their performance on 14 simple mobility tasks, including transfer, standing, and reaching.","timeFrame":"Three months after the last training session"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), consists of 4-level scale to examine joint spasticity based on muscle tone and resistance detected during passive stretching with good inter-rater reliability (ICC =0.85) (Bohannon \\& Smith, 1987).","timeFrame":"Three months after the last training session"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Category Test","description":"Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC) is a reliable measurement of independent walking ability on level-ground walking and stair ambulation, which is a good prediction of independent community walking post-stroke (Mehrholz, et al., 2007). FAC consists of 6-level scale: patients with FAC=4 requires supervision in level ground walking, FAC=5 requires supervision only when walking on non-level surface such as stairs.","timeFrame":"Three months after the last training session"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of ischemic brain injury or intracerebral haemorrhage shown by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography after the onset of stroke;\n* Significant gait deficit (Functional Ambulatory Category, FAC\\<4 \\[person cannot walk independently\\]).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any additional medical or psychological condition that would affect their ability to comply with the study protocol, e.g., a significant orthopaedic or chronic pain condition, major post-stroke depression, epilepsy, artificial cardiac pacemaker / joint;\n* Severe hip, knee or ankle contracture that would preclude passive range of motion of the leg (MAS\\<3).","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Raymond Tong, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+85239438454","email":"kytong@cuhk.edu.hk"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Raymond Tong, PhD","affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hong Kong","country":"Hong Kong","contacts":[{"name":"Raymond Tong, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+852 3943 8454"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":22.27832,"lon":114.17469}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
