Spatial neglect is a disorder that may occur after a stroke that leads to a person paying more attention to one side of their body over the other. Each testing session, they will perform paper and pencil neglect tests before and after playing a VR video game that is being designed as a potential future treatment. They will also give feedback on the game after the session is over. People who have spatial neglect after stroke are encouraged to apply."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spatial Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VR-based spatial retraining","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Game-like therapy activities will be taken place in a virtual environment, provided through an immersive head-mounted display.","interventionNames":["Other: VR Therapy Game"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"VR Therapy Game","description":"Participants will complete 15 sessions of VR-based therapy modules developed for use in helping people with spatial neglect.
