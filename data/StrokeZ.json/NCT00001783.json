In addition, if motor recovery is improved, the study will also identify the areas of the brain involved with the recovery.\n\nResearchers will use motor function ratings, PET scans, functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalographs, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evaluate patients.\n\nPatients participating in the study will be placed in one of two groups;\n\n1. Patients receiving dextroamphetamine and routine Rehabilitation Medicine\n2. Patients receiving a placebo \"sugar pill\" and routine Rehabilitation Medicine\n\nPatients that have improved motor recovery will undergo neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies to identify areas of the brain involved.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to determine if administration of dextroamphetamine (amph) linked with customarily used Rehabilitation Medicine accelerates motor recovery after stroke. Additionally, if motor recovery occurs, this study will allow identification of the brain regions activated in association with this recovery.\n\nTechniques used will include longitudinal rating of motor function, neuro-imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients will be assigned to one of the two groups: amph linked with PT, and placebo linked with PT. Every patient will receive the standard of care PT. Motor recovery will be evaluated in the two groups. If motor recovery is accelerated in any of the groups, then neuroimaging and neurophysiological data will allow identification of areas and networks in the brain associated with this recovery.\n\nThis is a Phase II study with potential major impact on how stroke patients are treated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Paralysis"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Plasticity","Stroke","Amphetamine","Motor","Hemiparetic","Thromboembolic Non-Hemorrhagic Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"0-15 Water"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nHemiparetic patients (right or left) (defined as a score of 55 or lower on Fugl-Meyer Scale) who had a single thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic infarction (documented by CT or MRI) 5 to 30 days before.\n\nPatients will be recruited from referrals from the community particularly from Suburban Hospital.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nLarge hemorrhagic or brain stem stroke.\n\nMultiple cerebral lesions with residual deficits.\n\nLess than 5 days after stroke or greater than 30 days after stroke.\n\nAge younger than 18 or older than 80 years.\n\nHistory of head injury with loss of consciousness.\n\nTerminal illness such as AIDS or cancer.\n\nSevere neurological diseases other than stroke.\n\nHistory of severe alcohol or drug abuse.\n\nHistory of psychiatric illness.\n\nUnstable cardiac dysrhythmia or unresponsive arterial hypertension (greater than 160/100 mmHg).\n\nUntreated hyperthyroidism.\n\nReceiving alpha-adrenergic antagonists or agonists.\n\nReceiving major/minor tranquilizers, clonidine, prazosin, phenytoin, GABA, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, haloperidol, other neuroleptics, barbituates.\n\nDegree of aphasia or cognitive deficit that makes patients unable to give informed consent.\n\nPregnancy.
