Acquired data will be used to define acceptable period of use for these protective costumes.","detailedDescription":"This research will recruit 14-20 volunteers. During 8 hours each subject will perform their work using protective costume. Heart rate, electrocardiogram, oxygenation, skin and air temperature under costume and hygrometric data will be registered. Also there will be questionnaires for volunteers for subjective assessment of thermal and moisture sensations and assessment of working conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Overheating"],"keywords":["Thermophysiology","Personal protective equipment from biological hazards","Medical workers","COVID-19","Working conditions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Health workers","description":"Medical personnel: doctors, nurses.","interventionNames":["Other: Personal protective equipment from biological hazard"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Personal protective equipment from biological hazard","description":"Includes: isolation clothing, mask, eyewear, overshoes","armGroupLabels":["Health workers"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Skin thermometry","description":"DS1923-F5 Thermochron iButtons (\"MaximIntegratedProducts, Inc\", USA)","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Hygrometry under costume","description":"DS1923-F5 Thermochron iButtons (\"MaximIntegratedProducts, Inc\", USA)","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Electrocardiography","description":"Electrocardiographic system \"Poly-Specter-SM\" (LLC \"Neurosoft\", Russia), all parameters.","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Blood pressure","description":"Electrocardiographic system \"Poly-Specter-SM\" (LLC \"Neurosoft\", Russia)","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Heart rate","description":"Electrocardiographic system \"Poly-Specter-SM\" (LLC \"Neurosoft\", Russia)","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Breathing rate","description":"Electrocardiographic system \"Poly-Specter-SM\" (LLC \"Neurosoft\", Russia)","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Air thermometry and hygrometry","description":"\"METEOSCOP-M\" (LLC \"NTM-Zashchita\", Russia)","timeFrame":"8 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Oxygenation","description":"Pulse oximeter MD300C2 (\"Choicemmed\", China)","timeFrame":"8 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* healthy individuals (based on medical screening)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* endocrinological diseases and disorders\n* health deviations at the time of the study","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Health workers","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Alexey Konyukhov","affiliation":"Junior scientist","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Federal State Budgetary Scientific Institution Izmerov Research Institute of Occupational Health","city":"Moscow","zip":"105275","country":"Russian Federation","geoPoint":{"lat":55.75222,"lon":37.61556}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000018883","term":"Heat Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000018882","term":"Heat Stress Disorders"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M2562","name":"COVID-19","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20615","name":"Heat Stroke","asFound":"Overheating","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15946","name":"Sunstroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M24606","name":"Stress Disorders, Traumatic","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20614","name":"Heat Stress Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
