To explore the effects of CTAR exercise on stroke patients with dysphagia, and to perform a clinically implementable evidence-based protocol.\n2. Introduce the evidence-based \"CTAR exercise protocol\" in the care of stroke patients with dysphagia, and test the effects through a randomized controlled trial.\n\nThis study is a two-group, pre and post-test, parallel, non-blind randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the \"CTAR exercise protocol\". Convenience sampling the inpatients of stroke with dysphagia from a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. Eighty participants will be randomized block assignment either to an experimental (n = 40) or to a control (n = 40) group. The experimental group will receive a four-week CTAR protocol and regular dysphagia care. The control group will receive the regular dysphagia care only. In this study, dysphagia-related physiological indicators including functional oral intake scale (FOIS), penetration-aspiration scale (PAS), and modified water swallowing test, video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), and swallowing improvement rate will be used to evaluate the difference between pre-test and four-week post-test after the intervention. The independent t-test will be used to compare the change effect of the two groups.","detailedDescription":"This study is a two-group, pre- and post-test, parallel, non-blind randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the \"chin retraction resistance exercise program\". The convenient sampling will be used to select inpatients with stroke and dysphagia in a regional hospital from southern Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will use block randomization to assign participants to either experimental or control group, and use sealed opaque envelopes to conceal the allocation sequences. The target sample size of 80 participants will be enrolled according to sample size calculation. The CTAR exercise is to tighten a rubber ball which placed between the chin and the sternum, and to perform 3 cycles of isometric exercise and isotonic exercise. The CTAR protocol is perform CTAR exercises three times a day, five days a week, and for four weeks. The research nurses will assist in screen and recruit subjects in clinical ward units, perform the CTAR exercise protocol, and collect dates. The independent t-test will be used to compare the change effect of the two groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","dysphagia","chin tuck against resistance exercise","randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will receive a four-week \"CTAR exercise protocol \" and routine dysphagia care.","interventionNames":["Other: Chin tuck against resistance exercise"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group will only receive routine dysphagia care."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Chin tuck against resistance exercise","description":"The experimental group will receive a four-week CTAR protocol and regular dysphagia care, while the control group will only receive routine dysphagia care.

The researcher nurse will inject 3ml of cold water into the bottom of the participant's mouth with an injection syringe, and then asks the participant to swallow the water for the swallowing test. If the participant is unable to swallow, or experienced dyspnea, coughing, or wet-hoarse dysphonia after swallowing, a score of 1-3 will be respective recorded. The lower the score, meaning the more serious problem of swallowing and choking. The sensitivity and specificity of MWST to differentiate between aspirators and non-aspirators with a cutoff level of 3 are 70 and 88%, respectively.
