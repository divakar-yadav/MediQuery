Approximately one quarter of posterior circulation strokes are due to stenosis in the vertebral artery and basilar artery.\n\nTwo previous randomized controlled trials focusing on vertebral artery stenting, the Vertebral Artery Stenting Trial (VAST) and the Vertebral Artery Ischaemia Stenting Trial (VIST) were underpowered because they failed to reach target recruitment, and both the trials found no difference in risk of the primary outcome between the stenting group and medical group.\n\nThe drug-eluting stenting versus medical therapy alone for patients with extracranial vertebral artery stenosis (VISTA) trial, is a government-funded, prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. It will recruit patients with 3 months stroke or TIA caused by 70-99% stenosis of extracranial vertebral artery (V1-2 segments). Only high-volume center with a proven track record will enroll patients. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to best medical treatment alone or medical treatment plus stenting. Primary outcome is a composite of any fatal or non-fatal stroke within 30 days after randomization, or ischemic stroke in the territory of the target artery beyond 30 days to 1 year. The VISTA trial will be conducted in 30 sites in China and aims to have a sample size of 472 subjects (stenting, 236; medical treatment, 236). Recruitment is expected to be finished by Sep, 2025. Patients will be followed for 1 year at first stage. Long-term follow-ups till 3 years or longer is also preplanned. The first stage of the trial is scheduled to complete in 2027."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Vertebral Artery Stenosis"],"keywords":["Extracranial vertebral artery
