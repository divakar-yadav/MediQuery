However, many patients do not improve beyond this initial period in spite of continued intensive physical therapy and supportive care. A prospective, randomized trial of the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatments in 59 such patients was published in January 2012. That study which used 40 hyperbaric oxygen treatments, indicated significant clinical neurological improvement in residual motor deficit in patients who had sustained a stroke over a year previously. An increase in brain activity in the region immediately surrounding their stroke (penumbra) was reported on the basis of SPECT studies. Regions of live cells were determined by CT. Because SPECT is primarily a measure of perfusion and not metabolic activity and CT is a poor measure of cell life, the investigators plan to assess areas of physiologic/anatomic mismatch in similar patients following hyperbaric oxygen treatment by the use of the more appropriate and precise tools, PET and MRI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"single group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"single group of 6 patients will be treated with hyperbaric oxygen at 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 90 minutes 5 days per week for 4 weeks (20 treatments) to see if the previously reported increase in cell metabolism following such treatment can be better documented by the more sensitive and precise method for assessing this, i.e. PET/MRI, than the previously reported SPECT/CT method","interventionNames":["Other: hyperbaric oxygen chamber"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"hyperbaric oxygen chamber","armGroupLabels":["single group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Increase in cellular metabolic activity in ischemic post stroke-penumbra PET scans","timeFrame":"2 weeks after treatment with Hyperbaric Oxygen"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the motor function deficit post-stroke by Physical Therapists' measurements of motor strength","timeFrame":"2 weeks after completion of hyperbaric oxygen therapy"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* person must have sustained an acute ischemic stroke 6-12 months prior to enrollment, exhibited clinical improvement during the initial 30-90 days post stroke, exhibited no further improvement for at least 1 month in spite of continued supportive care and physical therapy, must have at least one residual measurable motor deficit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSmoking, Contraindications to an MRI e.g. pacemaker, Contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen treatment e.g. emphysema, claustrophobia. seizure disorder, Inability to tolerate pressurization e.g. Eustachian tube dysfunction, other uncontrolled co-morbidities e.g. diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorders, renal or hepatic dysfunction.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"John D Davidson, MD","affiliation":"St. Luke's Hospital St. Louis","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"St. Luke's Hospital","city":"Chesterfield","state":"Missouri","zip":"63017","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.66311,"lon":-90.57707}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
