Other areas assessed include variables that help or hinder the discharge of patients with sufficient residential autonomy and the predictive ability of clinicians compared with the evaluation of selective indicators of outcome (clinical and instrumental).\n\nPatients are followed from the first day of hospitalization until discharge or up to 3 months and 1 day after the date of admission (\"long-term care\" patients).\n\nAt admission a \"Patient Form\" including social, demographic and clinical informations and a series of standardized assessment tools is completed with the help of clinicians, nurses and caregivers (when available).\n\nFor each patient, during hospitalization, an analysis of apolipoprotein ApoE polymorphisms is performed and adverse events occurred during hospitalization are monitored, as well as the predictive abilities of clinicians and any recent CT and MRI. Patients are reassessed at discharge (or after 3 months for \"long-term care\" patients) and at 6 months follow-up of with a standardized telephone interview to assess clinical and functional status and possible changes in the residential status of the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dementia","Motor Impairments","Stroke","Thighbone Fractures"],"keywords":["Cognitive impairment.","Geriatrics.","Hospital admission.","Hospital discharge."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood samples for the assessment of APOE genetic polymorphisms; routine lab examinations."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":329,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hospitalized patients","description":"All patients hospitalized in 4 inpatient facilities in Northern Italy during 4 index-months."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"evaluation of clinical improvement","timeFrame":"from admission to discharge (or after 3 months of hospitalization) and 6 months follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"identification of variables predictive of outcomes","timeFrame":"at discharge (or 3 months after admission) and 6 months follow-up"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"evaluation of predictive abilities of clinicians","timeFrame":"admission, discharge (or 3 months of hospitalization) and 6 months follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age 65 or older\n* informed consent provided\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* younger than 65 years\n* informed consent not provided","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients aged 65 or older admitted to 4 geriatric inpatient facilities.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Giovanni de Girolamo, M.D.","affiliation":"IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sacro Cuore di Ges√π Centre","city":"San Colombano al Lambro","state":"Milan","zip":"20078","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.18322,"lon":9.49028}},{"facility":"beata Vergine della Consolata Hospital","city":"San Maurizio Canavese","state":"Turin","zip":"10077","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.21705,"lon":7.63052}},{"facility":"IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli","city":"Brescia","zip":"25125","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.53558,"lon":10.21472}},{"facility":"San Raffaele Arcangelo Hospital","city":"Venezia","zip":"30121","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.43713,"lon":12.33265}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Website of the coordinating centre","url":"http://www.irccs-fatebenefratelli.it"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003704","term":"Dementia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000019965","term":"Neurocognitive Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6594","name":"Dementia","asFound":"Dementia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M29395","name":"Cognitive Dysfunction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26060","name":"Fractures, Bone","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21526","name":"Neurocognitive Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"}]}},"hasResults":false}
