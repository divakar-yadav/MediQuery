Patients who undergo out- or inpatient treatment and who receive a 12lead-ECG are asked to participate in this examination. Furthermore, 50 patients without heart disease should be included (control group).","detailedDescription":"Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in Germany. Clinical studies have shown that atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and reduced quality of life. Patients with atrial fibrillation have a three times higher risk of heart failure and a four to five times higher risk of ischemic stroke. In addition to these risks, atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and therefore more difficult to diagnose. It is estimated that about one third of all atrial fibrillation patients are asymptomatic.\n\nFor this reason, the study \"Opportunistic Screening in Pharmacies for Atrial Fibrillation in Seniors\" was conducted in Aachen. Within four weeks more than 7000 volunteers could be measured in participating pharmacies using a ECG hand-held diagnostic tool. Since the already measured subjects only have the SL-ECG measurement of the hand-held diagnostic tool, the aim of this substudy is to establish a reference group. In this reference group a 12lead-ECG is performed by routine ECG and a SL-ECG measurement by ECG hand-held diagnostic tool. The aim of the study is to compare the measured parameters and to optimize the algorithm to evaluate the remaining SL-ECGs of the main study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["ECG","Atrial Fibrillation","ECG Hand-held Diagnostic Tool"],"keywords":["ECG measurement","AF-Stroke","Germany","Electrocardiogram"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":550,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients","description":"Patients (500 patients â‰¤ ) who undergo out- or inpatient treatment and who did a 12lead-ECG measurement, repeat the procedure using the hand-held diagnostic tool (SL-ECG).","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: SL-ECG"]},{"label":"Control Group","description":"Fifty volunteers who did a 12lead-ECG measurement, repeat the procedure using the hand-held diagnostic tool (SL-ECG).","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: SL-ECG"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"SL-ECG","description":"additional SL-ECG measurement","armGroupLabels":["Control Group","Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of the SL-ECG (hand-held diagnostic tool) with the 12lead-ECG (gold standard) to identify and evaluate cardiac arrhythmias.","description":"The 12lead-ECG and the measurement of the hand-held diagnostic tool, performed by the proband/volunteer after the main examination, are crucial for the examination. The ECG hand-held diagnostic tool measures the heartbeat by analyzing the RR-intervals and gives a direct indication of irregularities through a red light after the measurement.

The SL-ECG, person-specific data (e.g. age, BMI) and medical history (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, drug intake) are used to validate known prognostic factors and to find new prognostic factors. Continuous variables are summarized by calculating mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles and interquartile distances. For categorial variables, frequencies and percentages are calculated and tabulated. Based on these values, the raw incidence as well as age- and gender-specific incidences of atrial fibrillation can be calculated.","timeFrame":"12 Month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient is 18 years old, for minors the signature of the legal guardian is required.\n* Understanding of the essence, meaning and scope of the study.\n* Patients (in-/outpatient) who receive a 12lead ECG through Medical Clinic 1.\n* Volunteers who are willing to have a 12lead ECG and an SL-ECG performed and provide medical information.\n* Signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Insufficient language skills\n* Limited cognitive abilities\n* Limited physical abilities (i.e. tremor)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients and volunteers that meets the inclusion criteria and are not affected by the exclusion criteria are allowed to participate in this study.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nikolaus Marx","affiliation":"Head of the Clinic for Cardiology, Pneumology, Angiology and Internal Intensive Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Uniklinium RWTH Aachen","city":"Aachen","state":"North-Rhine-Westphalia","zip":"52074","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":50.77664,"lon":6.08342}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"11216949","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Chugh SS, Blackshear JL, Shen WK, Hammill SC, Gersh BJ.
