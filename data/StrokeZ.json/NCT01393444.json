This study focuses on an ECoG-based BCI system. ECoG measures brain activity using electrodes implanted on the surface of the brain. Each participant will undergo testing of the ECoG direct brain interface for up to 29 days. Participants will learn to control computer cursors, virtual reality environments, and assistive devices such as hand orthoses and functional electrical stimulators using neural activity recorded with the ECoG sensor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tetraplegia","Spinal Cord Injury","Brachial Plexus Injury","Muscular Dystrophy","ALS","Brainstem Stroke"],"keywords":["Electrocorticography","Tetraplegia","Spinal cord injury","Brainstem stroke","Neuroprosthetic","Brain-computer interface","Direct brain interface","Neural activity","Motor cortex"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Direct Brain Interface Users","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants enrolled in the study will undergo \"Implantation of ECoG sensors on the brain surface\" to record neural activity.
