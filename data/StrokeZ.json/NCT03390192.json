Recently, more challenging approaches, such as stimulation of two or more sites or use of dual modality have been studied in stroke patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both inhibitory rTMS (1Hz) and anodal tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) was investigated to compare its modulatory effects with single inhibitory rTMS stimulation in subacute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Noninvasive brain stimulation","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual-mode stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dual-mode stimulation is applied over the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) using active rTMS and active tDCS. 1 Hz of rTMS is applied over the contralesional M1 for 20 minutes with simultaneous application of anodal tDCS on the ipsilesional M1.\n\nEach participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.","interventionNames":["Device: Dual-mode stimulation"]},{"label":"Single sham stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Single sham stimulation is applied over the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) using active rTMS and sham tDCS. 1 Hz of rTMS over the contralesional M1 was applied for 20 minutes with simultaneous application of tDCS with sham mode (no stimulation) on the ipsilesional M1.\n\nEach participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.","interventionNames":["Device: Single sham stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Dual-mode stimulation","description":"1Hz rTMS over contralesional primary motor cortex and anodal tDCS over ipsilesional primary motor cortex are simultaneously simulated.","armGroupLabels":["Dual-mode stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Single sham stimulation","description":"1Hz rTMS over contralesional primary motor cortex and sham tDCS (no stimulation) over ipsilesional primary motor cortex are simultaneously simulated.","armGroupLabels":["Single sham stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment score","description":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment score reflects a motor impairment of a patient.
