While the Burt robotic-arm assists the patient's upper-limb in their movements, BurtVision will allow the patient to perform unimanual and bimanual activities while leveraging augmented reality games. The investigators will compare clinical outcomes when the BurtVisions ystem is used for training solely relying on unimanual tasks vs. when it is used for training relying on both unimanual and bimanual tasks.","detailedDescription":"The proposed study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of using the BurtVistion on motor gains after robot-assisted upper-limb. Study participants (stroke survivors) will be recruited at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - Boston. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two different groups: unimanual or unimanual + bimanual arm therapy using a block-randomized allocation procedure to ensure important covariates, such as baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) scores and chronicity, are balanced between groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Study participants will be randomized to either 1) manual robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation, and 2) unimanual+bimanual robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome assessor will be blinded to the treatment allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Unimanual robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants randomized to this arm of the study will undergo 18 one-hour sessions of robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation.
