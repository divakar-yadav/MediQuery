Preliminary data suggest that antiplatelet therapy discontinuation is not associated with any increase in ischemic events, and could potentially translate into a lower rate of major bleeding events at longer term follow-up. We therefore hypothesize that in young patients without any other comorbidities increasing the risk of stroke, shorter-term (≤1 year instead of lifelong) antiplatelet treatment could be a safe option following PFO closure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patent Foramen Ovale","Ischemic Stroke","Bleeding Ulcer"],"keywords":["Transcatheter Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) closure","Ischemic Stroke","Bleeding","Young patients"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"At 12 months post-PFO closure, patients will discontinue the antiplatelet treatment.
