The aim of the study is to develop a system-integrated technology-enabled intervention (SINEMA) model for the secondary prevention of stroke in rural China and evaluate the effectiveness of the model compared with usual care. The hypothesis is that trained village doctors, equipped with digital health technology, can provide essential evidence-based care to stroke survivors in rural China.","detailedDescription":"The SINEMA trial is a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of implementation of a system-integrated and technology-enabled model of care to improve the secondary prevention of stroke in Nanhe County, a rural area of Hebei province, China. Fifty villages from five townships are stratified randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention arm (implementing SINEMA model) or the control arm (usual care).\n\nAfter a baseline survey, intervention will be implemented in 25 intervention villages, lasting for 12 months. Follow-up survey will be conducted in the same way in all villages at 12-month after the initial of the study. Process evaluation will be conducted every three month, and economic evaluation will also be conducted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["secondary prevention","primary healthcare","village doctors","rural China","medication adherence","physical activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The SINEMA model, cognizant of health system's organization around primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare levels in China, adopts the principles of cascade training with feedback and task-sharing, and relies on existing human resources available at the community level.
