This pilot study aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).","detailedDescription":"Specific Aims This project is to conduct a pilot, phase II randomized clinical trial which aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) The primary endpoint is the safety and compliance of 4 weeks of TRF in AIS patients.\n\nThe secondary endpoints are the efficacy of 4 weeks of TRF compared to normal eating (NE) on plasma and imaging biomarkers and functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.\n\nThis study will determine whether compared to NE control:\n\n1. TRF (16 hours fasting daily) is safe and well-tolerated in patients with AIS.\n2. TRF improves functional outcome compared to NE in AIS patients. (3) TRF decreases plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines including metallopeptidase (MMP)-9, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in plasma compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.\n\n(4) TRF improves diffusion tensor imaging on MRI at 3 months post stroke compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.\n\n(5) TRF changes plasma exosome components, metabolomics and lipidomics compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fasting"],"keywords":["fasting","safety","compliance","ischemic stroke","time restricted feeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dietary counseling alone","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"1.
