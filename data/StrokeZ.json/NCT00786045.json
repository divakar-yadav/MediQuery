Previous research has indicated that cognitive-affective-behavioural profile is related to exercise activity in a number of populations including sedentary adults, older adults and patients with cardiovascular disease. As we anticipate that one of the mechanisms by which the cycling will result in an outcome better than the more traditional type of disability tailored exercise program is through greater compliance, this second objective is very relevant. This study will also address the impact of regular exercise on cardio-vascular risk factor profile.","detailedDescription":"The specific clinical hypothesis to be tested is that, over a one year period, persons assigned to the general fitness \"cycle\" group will experience a greater increase in functional exercise"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","walking"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home Cycling Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be given a time and intensity graded program at an intensity that is comfortable and tolerable for the individual.
