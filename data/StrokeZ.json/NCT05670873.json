This model may be the basis for initiating individualized closed-loop neuromodulation treatment in patients with DoC.","detailedDescription":"Despite continued advances in life-sustaining intensive care for severe brain injury patients, little can be done to promote behavioral recovery in patients with disorder of consciousness (DoC). Arousal is the primary task in the rehabilitation of patients with impaired consciousness. Evidence suggests that some medications and physical therapies can induce wakefulness by reactivating specific pathways that lead to impaired consciousness. However, due to the complexity of the type, degree, location, and other related influencing factors of brain injury, the current commonly used treatment options are not effective for patients with impaired consciousness, and the theoretical basis for benefit is not sufficient.\n\nThis study is aimed at evaluating the potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with acute severe ischemic stroke with DoC while assessing patients with a hybrid neural network evaluation model. This model may be the basis for initiating individualized closed-loop neuromodulation treatment in patients with DoC.\n\nBefore and after a course of treatment (20 days), activation and connectivity of patients' arousal centers will be assessed through a hybrid neural network evaluation model, which consists of comprehensive cortical connectivity parameters (perturbational complexity index and evoked high-frequency oscillations) and region-specific cortical connectivity parameters (short-latency afferent inhibition and mismatch negativity). Each parameter is clinically used to assess a patient's level of cortex connectivity. This hybrid evaluation model may give a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's degree of awareness, and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Consciousness Disorder","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Consciousness Disorder","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Hybrid Neural Network Evaluation Model"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rTMS treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20 days of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: stimulation site is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, stimulation intensity at 90% RMT, stimulation frequency is 10Hz.

This procedure is typically administered at bedside. The protocol is divided into 6 sub-scales, each assessing a different area (e.g., visual function, auditory function, communication, arousal), and the final score is calculating by adding all sub-scales.The total score of this scale goes from its minimum, 0, which implied a state of coma, to 23, which implies emergence from a Minimally Conscious State (i.e., eMCS).
