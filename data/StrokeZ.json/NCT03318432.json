Anyone who is 18 years of age or older and has had a stroke may submit a survey to join. The self-reported information on the survey will be used to match participants to current or future stroke research studies and study personnel for each specific study may contact participants for further screening. Some studies are recruiting participants nationally, not just in the San Francisco Bay Area."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Cerebral Ischemia","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebral Stroke","Cerebral Vascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Cerebral Ischemia","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebral Stroke","Cerebral Vascular Accident","Stroke Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Total Enrollment","description":"Total Number of Participants in the Registry","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* 18 years of age or older\n* Have suffered a stroke\n* Have ongoing symptoms as a result of the stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke survivors","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Emerald Wan","role":"CONTACT","phone":"415-353-2194","email":"strokerecoveryinitiative@ucsf.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Anthony S.
