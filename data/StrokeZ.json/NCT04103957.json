Virtual reality technique may solved this problem. The investigators want to build up the motion trajectory system by head-mounted display virtual reality technique, and to explore the effect of visual feedback on motion trajectory in a virtual reality environment.","detailedDescription":"How to increase the rehabilitation intensity in the critical rehabilitation window for stroke patients (half year since onset) was very important. The training intensity and frequency of upper extremities is insufficient. The proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) movements of upper extremities are applied to all daily upper extremities movement. The goals of this study are that the investigators want to build up the motion trajectory system by head-mounted display virtual reality technique, and the investigators want to explore the effect of visual feedback on motion trajectory in a virtual reality environment. The investigators will record the motion patterns, motion trajectory and the deviation of position and angle comparing to the normal PNF movement pattern to analyze the motion accuracy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Control"],"keywords":["Virtual reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motion accuracy","description":"Record the motion patterns, motion trajectory and the deviation of position and angle comparing to the normal PNF movement pattern to analyze the motion accuracy","timeFrame":"during the experiment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Stroke patients Inclusion criteria\n\n1.
