CPSP has been treated with three distinct types of neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation of the sensory thalamus (Vc-DBS), motor cortex repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (M1-rTMS), and motor cortex stimulation (MCS)), but the level of evidence for these procedures is very low. Moreover, data on the changes in pain brain circuitry in CPSP, and the effect of neuromodulation on this circuitry is very limited.","detailedDescription":"In this project, we propose a prospective double-blind randomized crossover on/off study in 32 CPSP patients. These patients will undergo M1-rTMS and either MCS or Vc-DBS. Before and after active and inactive stimulation they will be assessed with clinical scales for pain, function, quality of life and depression. Adverse events will be monitored. This allows to measure the outcome and safety of neuromodulation in CPSP.\n\nIn addition, we will have functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) use. This will provide insight into the pathological changes in the pain circuitry, and the influence of neuromodulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Central Post-stroke Pain","CPSP"],"keywords":["neuromodulation","DBS","rTMS","MCS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Blinding for rTMS (active stimulation vs sham stimulation)","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with CPSP which is pharmacorefractory and have a good analgesic response to M1-rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Diagnosed with definite CPSP (Treede-Klit criteria), which is pharmacorefractory (i.e. amitriptyline 75mg/d 4w, lamotrigine 200mg/d 8w and pregabalin 600mg/d resulting in \\<50% VAS reduction and/or intolerable side-effects).\n\nA good analgesic response to M1-rTMS is defined as: ≥50% mean 10-d VAS reduction immediately following vs. before active M1-rTMS minus mean 10-d VAS reduction immediately following vs. pre sham M1-rTMS.
