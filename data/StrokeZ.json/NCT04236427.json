The effect of Angong Niuhuang Wan on liver and kidney function will be focused and using NMR techniques to analysis metabolomics to further study the safety and effectiveness of Angong Niuhuang Wan on the prevention and treatment of stroke.\n\nIt is a 24-week trial, Double-blind treatment for 1 week, follow up visit for 23 weeks.
