Via animal models hypothermia has been identified as the most promising neuroprotective therapy in focal cerebral ischemia as well. But the prove of clinical benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke is still missing: Most likely due to the prolonged time window until hypothermia-induction (14 h) in previous studies. In addition, feasibility of the method through which hypothermia is applied is crucial for a broad implementation of hypothermia in stroke therapy. Surface versus endovascular cooling have never been compared in a prospective trial in awake stroke patients.\n\nHAIS-SE is evaluating for the first time ever in a randomized controlled trial efficacy, tolerability, practicability and safety of endovascular versus surface cooling in awake stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Thrombolysis","Hypothermia"],"keywords":["hypothermia","induction of hypothermia","non invasive cooling","external cooling","surface cooling","endovascular cooling","cooling catheter","stroke","shivering","neuro monitoring","coagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular cooling","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Endovascular cooling using the cooling device ZOLL Thermogard XP with ZOLL Quattro cooling catheter","interventionNames":["Device: ZOLL Thermogard XP"]},{"label":"Surface cooling","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Surface cooling using the cooling device BARD/Medivance Arctic Sun 5000 with BARD/Medivance Arctic Gel Pads","interventionNames":["Device: BARD/Medivance Arctic Sun 5000"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Best medical treatment following international stroke guidelines"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ZOLL Thermogard XP","description":"Induction of hypothermia with 1L cold crystalloid infusions (0,9%NaCl or Ringer's solution).
