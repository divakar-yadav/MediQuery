Our ultimate objective is to design of a future multi center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial comparing the clinical efficacy of the polypill strategy vs 'usual care' in the African context to derive locally relevant, high-quality evidence for routine deployment of polypill for CVD risk moderation among stroke survivors in LMICs.

Furthermore, a cadre of emerging investigators from Ghana will benefit from the rich learning environment to be created through the implementation of the RCT and the interactions (2 years) with experts from the Medical University of South Carolina.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":148,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Polypill","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Assigned to a polypill containing 2/3 antihypertensives, a moderate/high-intensity statin and Aspirin to be taken orally, once daily in the form of a hard capsule","interventionNames":["Drug: Polycap"]},{"label":"Usual Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Will continue to take separate, individual secondary preventive medications as prescribed"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Polycap","description":"Assigned to a polypill containing 2/3 antihypertensives, a moderate/high-intensity statin and Aspirin to be taken orally, once daily in the form of a hard capsule","armGroupLabels":["Polypill"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Carotid Intimal Media Thickness","description":"Thickness of the intima and media layers of the carotid arteries","timeFrame":"Baseline and 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Morisky Adherence Scale Score","description":"The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) is a validated assessment tool used to measure non-adherence in a variety of patient populations.
