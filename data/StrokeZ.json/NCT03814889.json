The patient will wear the device daily. At the beginning and end of the phase, arm function will be tested.\n\nPHASE 4: This study takes 3 or 6 months. 1) If the patient gets Botox injections in their hand and arm, their arm function will be measured for three months during this standard care. 2) Next, all patients will be given a wearable device to take home. The patient will wear the device while feeling vibrations for 3 hours during the day while awake for two months.
