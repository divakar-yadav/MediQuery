Subjects will be followed for 90 days post stroke onset. The primary effectiveness endpoint for this study will be the binary endpoint that defines success as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 and failure as an mRS score of 3-6 at 90 days or the last rating. The secondary effectiveness endpoint for this study will be the change in NIHSS score from baseline to 90 days or the last rating, analyzed across the full range of scores on the NIHSS. Tertiary effectiveness endpoints include: The 90-day binary endpoint, denoted as the 90-day bNIH score, based on the NIHSS score that defines a successful result as either (i) an improvement of 9 or more points on the NIHSS or (ii) a final NIHSS score of 0 or 1; the score on the mRS at 90 days or the last rating analyzed across the range of scores from 0 to 6 on the mRS scale, SIS-16 at 90 days; mortality at 30, 60 and 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute stroke","infrared laser therapy","clinical trial","safety","effectiveness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":660,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial Laser Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: NeuroThera® Laser System"]},{"label":"Sham control procedure","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: NeuroThera® Laser System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NeuroThera® Laser System","description":"Transcranial delivery of laser therapy or sham (no laser therapy) to the scalp","armGroupLabels":["Sham control procedure","Transcranial Laser Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Disability scale (mRS)score at 90 days; safety of the treatment procedure","timeFrame":"at baseline, day 5, 30, 60 and 90 post treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional neurological scale(NIHSS)over time","timeFrame":"at baseline, Day 5, 30, 60 and 90"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
