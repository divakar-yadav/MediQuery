A recent review indicates that RCTs comparing aquatic methods in both environments are lacking. The same movements in water and on dry land that target postural stability and gait require different competences. For example, the postural instability that occurs while squatting in water was enacted on land by sitting on a therapy ball. Furthermore, land-based conventional rehabilitation is generally task oriented, customized and challenging and follows a specific preparatory sequence of exercises according to patients' disabilities. Therefore, the investigators believe that a sequential preparatory approach (SPA), based on increasing difficulty and following a specific sequence of preparatory exercises (from the simplest to the most complex), should also be used in an aquatic environment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"8 individual experimental rehabilitation sessions as outpatients (2 days/week, 4 weeks), in a rehabilitation pool at Fondazione Santa Lucia Neurorehabilitation hospital.

The exercises followed a specific sequence starting from a kneeling position, proceeding to a sitting position and ending with a supine position. Step exercises preparatory for gait were performed using a step and two floating aids. Gait exercises were performed first with the upper limbs placed on two floating aids and then during a dual motor task (i.e., catching a ball thrown by the therapist).\n\nThe control aquatic therapy consists of water-based exercises, in line with suggestions of the Hydrotherapy Association of Chartered Physiotherapists Guidance on Good Practice in Hydrotherapy.\n\nThese consisted of warm-up exercises, stretching exercises for the lower limbs, recruitment exercises and walking exercises during each phase of gait (single stance, swing and double stance).","armGroupLabels":["control","experimental"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Berg Balance Scale at 2 months","description":"Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS) from baseline at 2 months.
