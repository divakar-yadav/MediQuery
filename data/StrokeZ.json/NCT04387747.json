The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia following stroke, to investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and duration of stroke, age, sex, etiology of stroke, ambulation status, spasticity, nutrition and malnutrition. Demographic characteristics, duration of stroke, sarcopenia presence (walking speed ≥ 0.8 m / s, SARC-F score ≥4, short physical performance battery score ≤ 8, thigh circumference \\<33cm (The data for Turkey) \\<31cm (European data)) were recorded. Hand grip strength (jamar) measured from the intact hand and TANITA BIA analysis were planned for all patients.\n\nAmbulation level with Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), nutritional status with 24-hour dietary recall (24HR) method, diagnosis of malnutrition with Glim Criteria, spasticity with Modified Ashworth Scale, motor development for stroke patient Brunnstrom staging, screening for frailty with Frail questionnaire activity of daily living were evaluated with Barthel Index."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcopenia","Stroke"],"keywords":["sarcopenia","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"SARCOPENIA IN STROKE PATIENTS","description":"Demographic characteristics, duration of stroke, sarcopenia presence,thigh circumference , Hand grip strength , TANITA BIA analysis"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)","description":"The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. FAC stage 0 indicates the non-functional ambulation, and stage 5 indicates the independent walking at each speed and on ground.","timeFrame":"1 interview day"},{"measure":"24-hour dietary recall (24HR) method","description":"24-hour dietary recall method consists of precisely recalling, describing and quantifying the intake of foods and beverages consumed during the day before the interview, from the first intake in the morning until the last foods or beverages consumed at night.","timeFrame":"1 interview day"},{"measure":"Glim Criteria","description":"The five criteria for malnutrition include non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass as phenotypic criteria, and reduced food intake/assimilation and inflammation/disease burden as etiologic criteria. It is proposed that the diagnosis of malnutrition be based upon the presence of at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion.","timeFrame":"1 interview day"},{"measure":"sarcopenia","description":"The walking speed ≥0.8 m / s, SARC-F score ≥4, short physical performance battery score ≤ 8, thigh circumference \\<33cm.","timeFrame":"1 interview day"},{"measure":"EQ-5D","description":"EQ-5D-3L is used to evaluate the quality of life.

The Barthel Index are assessed, including toileting, bathing, eating, dressing, continence, transfers, and ambulation.

Scoring: 0: No increase in muscle tone; 1: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension; 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM; 2: More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved; 3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult; 4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.","timeFrame":"1 interview day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with chronic stroke (Stroke duration \\> 3 months)\n* Patients with a FAC score \\> 3\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients unable to cooperate\n* Other diseases that cause gait disorders such as neuromuscular disease, cardiopulmonary problems.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Inpatient stroke cases","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"TUGBA AYDIN, MD","affiliation":"Istanbul Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Training & Research Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Istanbul Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital","city":"İstanbul","zip":"34192","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":41.01384,"lon":28.94966}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25676847","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Scherbakov N, Sandek A, Doehner W.
