Poor data exist concerning the rate of silent cerebral ischemic events following endovascular treatment of the aortic arch. The objective of this work was to quantify these lesions using the STEP registry.\n\nMethods. This multicentre retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients treated with an aortic endoprosthesis deployed in Ishimaru zone 0 to 3 and brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within 7 days after the procedure. DW-MRI was performed to identify the location and number of new silent brain infarctions (SBI), microbleeds ans general outcome of the patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Arch Aneurysm"],"keywords":["Thoracic endovascular aortic repair","Silent cerebral infarction","Stroke","Magnetic resonance imaging","DW-MRI","Aortic arch disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"17 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":91,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with Silent Brain Infarction","description":"treated with an aortic endoprosthesis deployed in Ishimaru zone 0 to 3 and brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within 7 days after the procedure with silent brain infarction","interventionNames":["Device: Endovascular Arch Procedures"]},{"label":"Patients without Silent Brain Infarction","description":"treated with an aortic endoprosthesis deployed in Ishimaru zone 0 to 3 and brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within 7 days after the procedure without silent brain infarction","interventionNames":["Device: Endovascular Arch Procedures"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Endovascular Arch Procedures","description":"Endovascular Arch Procedures (TEVAR, Branch endografts, Fenestrated endografts)","armGroupLabels":["Patients with Silent Brain Infarction","Patients without Silent Brain Infarction"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"frequency of silent cerebral infarcts on DW-MRI","description":"Primary outcomes were the frequency of silent cerebral infarcts on DW-MRI after endovascular arch procedures, and to identify the number, the distribution, and predictors of these lesions.","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"perioperative ischemic stroke","description":"Secondary outcomes were perioperative ischemic stroke defined as a brain infarction of ischemic etiology which occurs during surgery or within 30 days after surgery, TIA, hemorrhagic stroke, 30-day mortality, spinal cord ischemia, length of stay and discharge disposition.","timeFrame":"30 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Included patients underwent a proximal endograft deployment in Ishimaru zone 0 to 3\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Missing preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan of the chest and any circumstances that precluded the DW-MRI to be performed in the appropriate time window, such as a medical condition or an MRI contraindication","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Consecutive patients, who received routine postoperative DW-MRI within 7 days after endovascular aortic arch repair between September 2018 and January 2020 at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) and Marie Lannelongue Hospital (Paris, France) were identified.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Marie Lannelongue Hospital (Paris, France)","city":"Paris","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}},{"facility":"University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany)","city":"Hamburg","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.57532,"lon":10.01534}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33358103","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Charbonneau P, Kolbel T, Rohlffs F, Eilenberg W, Planche O, Bechstein M, Ristl R, Greenhalgh R, Haulon S; STEP collaborators.
