Persons after stroke often have problems moving their affected arm, leading to limitations in performing simple tasks. In previous research in a group of 60 patients post stroke the investigators investigated two things: they observed how patients can move their affected arm, and the investigators asked patients to indicate how they think they can use their affected arm. Surprisingly, the investigators concluded that in patients with a similar, good observed arm use there were two groups: (1) a 'match' group, reporting they can use their arm well, and (2) a 'mismatch' group, reporting they can not use their arm well. This project will further investigate this last group. The investigators will now use sensor technology to investigate the actual daily life arm use during daily life. The investigators hypothesize this daily arm use will be lower in the mismatch group than in the group with good observed and perceived ability.","detailedDescription":"The investigators will perform a cross-sectional study to acquire insight into the actual daily-life UL activity profile of patients in the chronic phase post stroke. A sample of 60 community-dwelling patients more than six months after stroke will be recruited and will be investigated with both standardized clinical, patient-reported and sensor-based UL assessments. Our sample will include three groups of 20 patients with (1) both low observed and perceived function; (2) both good observed and perceived function; and (3) good observed but low perceived function, i.e. the mismatch group.\n\nTo better understand this mismatch group, it is pivotal to investigate daily arm and hand use in patients in the chronic phase after stroke as the investigators expect patients in the mismatch group to have significantly reduced arm and hand use throughout the day. After all, stroke rehabilitation interventions intend to improve patients' performance in daily life, but the objective evaluation of this aim is a challenge. Standardized assessments performed in the rehabilitation environment or patients' home do not validly reflect daily-life upper-limb use. To achieve insight into the observed upper limb function, apart from using internationally accepted observation-based assessments such as the FMA and SIS hand function, monitoring patients after stroke will also be performed using sensor-based systems.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize the mismatch group will show a comparable daily-life UL activity profile compared to patients with both low observed and perceived function. However, when compared to patients with good observed and perceived function, the mismatch group shows significantly reduced daily-life UL activity by means of sensor-based evaluation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low match","description":"A group with both low observed and perceived upper limb ability.","interventionNames":["Other: \"Class 1 Medical Device\" CE certified devices: ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer"]},{"label":"Good match","description":"A group with both good observed and perceived upper limb ability.","interventionNames":["Other: \"Class 1 Medical Device\" CE certified devices: ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer"]},{"label":"Mismatch","description":"A group with good observed but low perceived function.","interventionNames":["Other: \"Class 1 Medical Device\" CE certified devices: ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"\"Class 1 Medical Device\" CE certified devices: ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer","description":"Accelerometers on both patients' wrists will give insight into the daily life upper limb use.","armGroupLabels":["Good match","Low match","Mismatch"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer motor assessment - upper extremity","description":"Investigation of overall motor impairment of the affected upper limb: shoulder, arm, wrist, hand and fingers.\n\nMinimum: 0.
