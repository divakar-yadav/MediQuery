Both patients receiving thrombolysis and those who do not due to contraindications such as anticoagulation or recent surgery are enrolled, but into different study arms (CE-5S A for thrombolysis and B for non-thrombolysis); the decision to treat with thrombolysis or not is done according to clinical routine.\n\nAll included patients are randomized to receive transcranial ultrasound and SonoVue-infusion or sham-ultrasound and placebo; i.e. in CE-5S A, contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis is compared to thrombolysis and in CE-5S B, contrast enhanced sonolysis is compared with conservative management.\n\nMain outcome is improvement in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours compared to baseline.
