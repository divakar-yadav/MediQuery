Expensive mass media stroke education campaigns are not sustainable for this purpose, particularly in economically disadvantaged populations. Instead, the investigators propose to intervene in school classrooms with children aged 9 to 11 years, to teach the five cardinal stroke symptoms, the correct course of action when they occur, and to highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of early hospital arrival, with the intent that the children will then educate their parents. To help accomplish this, the investigators have developed a program called Hip Hop Stroke (HHS), which is comprised of rap songs and two animated musical cartoons that incorporate stroke knowledge.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term adult disability in the U.S. and third leading cause of death, and has a 2-fold greater incidence in Blacks compared to the majority Americans. Thrombolytic revascularization treatment administered within a maximum of 3 hours from symptom onset reduces morbidity, mortality and costÍ¾ however, only 3% of patients arrive at the hospital within 3 hours,4 mostly due to the public's lack of knowledge concerning stroke symptoms, and the appropriate response when they are recognized, which is to call 911. The investigators propose to reduce these delays using a novel behavioral intervention to improve symptom recognition and response in a high-risk, minority, economically disadvantaged population. Despite the abundance of stroke education materials available, studies continue to reveal severe deficiencies in stroke literacy (knowledge of symptoms, urgent action, and prevention measures). Expensive mass media stroke education campaigns are not sustainable for this purpose, particularly in economically disadvantaged populations. Instead, the investigators propose to intervene in school classrooms with children aged 9 to 11 years, to teach the five cardinal stroke symptoms, the correct course of action when they occur, and to highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of early hospital arrival, with the intent that the children will then educate their parents. To help accomplish this, the investigators have developed a program called Hip Hop Stroke (HHS), which is comprised of rap songs and two animated musical cartoons that incorporate stroke knowledge.\n\nTargeting children to intervene with their parents has been rarely and sporadically attempted in various content areas, but the interventions have used traditional teaching methods that do not engage the children, and little success has been reported. In contrast, the HHS intervention was designed in collaboration with school-aged children, children's education television/media experts, as well as public health experts, school principals, and neurologists. As a result, not only is the targeting of children for this purpose an important innovation, but so is the careful development of materials designed to appeal to them. Moreover, the investigators note that utilizing children as a \"transmission vector\" for carrying out interventions aimed at their parents has the potential to serve as the basis for intervention in any number of other areas, for example, medication adherence, healthy eating and weight loss, treatment of diabetes, and so on.Thus, the significance of the proposed trial addresses the public health problem under study stroke symptom identification and response as well as development and refinement of a more general model of intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Children","Hip Hop Stroke","New York City"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4614,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hip Hop Stroke educational program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Hip Hop Stroke is a school-based educational program that incorporates educational hip hop music and two cartoons to communicate stroke knowledge to children.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Hip Hop Stroke educational program"]},{"label":"Nutrition Education program","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The investigators will use what they will refer to as a \"usual care\" control.
