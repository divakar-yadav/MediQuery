The stroke rehabilitation program is a complex process that requires a multidisciplinary approach to existing motor, sensory and / or neuropsychological deficiencies through re-education techniques based fundamentally on the phenomenon of neuronal plasticity and task-oriented rehabilitation.\n\nThere is evidence that supports the need to work on the intensity and repetition of motor skills in treatments to promote neuroplasticity and motor relearning. Considering the significant advances in information and communication technology (ICT) and more specifically the rapid development and deployment of technology, a number of recent systematic and non-systematic reviews highlight the increasing use of wearable devices to provide intensity to rehabilitation after of suffering a stroke including robotics, virtual reality, functional electrical stimulation (FES).\n\nRobot-assisted therapy for post-stroke rehabilitation is relatively new as a complementary tool to physical therapy, through which patients practice their limb and paretic hand, resorting to or resisting the force offered by these robots.\n\nThe strongest point of these devices is the \"attractive\" variety of exercises that provide the user with great motivation, in addition to the \"intensity\" factor in the therapies. These factors allow for rehabilitation treatments with robotic technology, which cannot be achieved with any conventional rehabilitation therapy. The Amadeo® Manual Robotic System (Tyromotion GmbH, Graz, Austria) is designed for rehabilitative treatment of the hand and fingers providing robot-assisted exercise for the finger flexors and extensors. This system has a controlled position, active, active-assisted and passive exercise mode, it also allows isometric exercises with visual feedback provided during computerized games that emphasize flexion and extension.\n\nAnother of the functions that this device presents and that differentiates it from other handheld robotic systems is its vibration function.

In contrast, Merkel-Ranvier cells and Ruffini corpuscles are called slow-adapting and classically described as sensitive to sustained pressure. That is why authors of different studies have focused on high frequency vibration of 300 Hz, for 30 minutes. 3 times per week.\n\nThe duration of vibratory stimulation, different studies show the effects of vibration and changes in the cortex after performing the treatment constantly, for about ten days, intensively three to four days a week, observing long-term changes. term on cortical excitability. With regard to the evaluation of the different variables that are the subject of this study, a review of the tests has been carried out with more sensitive and reliable results at present. The Fugl Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity Scale (UE) continues to be one of the most commonly used and specific tests to assess motor and sensory impairment in stroke patient.\n\nSince one of the main variables and object of measurement of the present study is sensitivity, it has been introduced, Semmes-Weinstein® Monofilaments is the most common and accurate instrument for sensory assessment. There are multiple scales to measure functionality such as FIM36 (Functional Independence Measure), FAM (Functional Assessment Measure), Barthel Index, however, the Motor Activity Log scale measures the functionality and motor performance of the most affected upper limb in a specific way, as well as its spontaneous use and integration in quantity and quality in the performance of Activities of Daily Living.\n\nStroke impact Scale (SIS) is a specific questionnaire for patients with brain damage and measures the impact it has had on their quality of life. SIS version 3.0 contains 8 domains related to hand function, strength, activities of daily living, communication, emotion, memory, and thinking. The SIS is a valid and reliable measure for a diverse group of patients after suffering a stroke.\n\nThe present study aims to determine, in stroke patients with left hemiparesis, the efficacy of intensive vibration therapy treatment with the Amadeo® robotic system, focusing on assessing sensitivity, integration of the affected upper limb and functionality, as well such as the improvement in the quality of life in the execution of their Activities of daily living in comparison with those patients who do not receive intensive vibration treatment but do perform upper limb treatment with the Amadeo® robotic system.\n\nWe present a randomized controlled trial to compare the improvement in sensitivity, the integration of the hemibody and the functionality in a sample of people who have suffered a stroke with left hemiparesis and receive intensive vibratory treatment, through the Amadeo robotic system ® compared to another population with the same characteristics that does not receive this vibration therapy, although they do perform robotic treatment without vibration.\n\nIt will be conducted at the \"Los Madroños\" hospital and Clínica NEURON (Madrid, Spain).\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Age: people aged between 30 and 80 years.\n* Diagnosis: stroke in the right hemisphere.\n* Right-handed.\n* Present hemiparesis or left hemiplegia with paralysis / paresis in his affected hand.\n* People with sensitivity alterations as a result of stroke.\n* Evolution: subacute patients (from three months to one year, and who at the same time meet the subacute criteria of the IMSERSO document of the model of care for people with brain damage, as well as chronic patients (after one year, and who meet the chronicity criteria of the IMSERSO document of the model of care for people with brain damage).\n* People without other concomitant pathologies that affect mobility and / or sensitivity\n* The acceptance and signing of the informed consent by the user.\n* Present a score equal to or greater than 24 points in the Mini-Mntal State Examination (MMSE).\n* Patients can be admitted or outpatient as long as they meet the above criteria and belong to the advanced neurorehabilitation unit.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patients with Aphasia and / or Apraxia.\n* Patients with serious difficulties in communication.\n* Patients who do not present limitation of mobility and / or sensitivity.\n* Other concomitant diseases.\n* Diagnosis: left or posterior hemisphere stroke.\n* Present a score of less than 24 points on the MMSE.\n* Age over 80 years and under 30 years.\n* The non-acceptance and signing of the informed consent by the subject.\n* Evolution: acute patients less than three months of evolution.\n\nPatients eligible to receive treatment will be consecutively randomized into two groups, those who receive robotic therapy with vibration and movement, and those who receive only vibration.\n\nOutcomes:\n\n* Clinical information: patient's sociodemographic data and anamnesis, the neurological examination and the different functional and sensitivity scales of which are:\n* Semmes-Weinstein (SW) ® monofilaments for sensitivity assessment\n* Fugl Meyer Assessment scale for the upper limb.\n* Motor Activity Log (MAL).\n* Stroke Impacte Scale (SIS).\n* Questionnaire of satisfaction with technology. (based on the principles of the Likert scale)\n\nFollow up:\n\nOne month after the post-treatment evaluation, the research team will re-evaluate, administering all the tests from the previous evaluations except for the technology satisfaction questionnaire. It will be carried out in the Advanced Neurorehabilitation Unit and exclusively to the population of the experimental group to see if the results obtained in the treatment are maintained over time.\n\nIntervention:\n\nThe patients will be referred by the team made up of rehabilitation doctors and specialized neurologists from Hospital Los Madroños and Clínica NEURON and will receive treatment in its Advanced Neurorehabilitation Units:\n\n* In the \"experimental\" group, sessions will be held three times a week with 24 sessions (a month and a half of treatment), with a vibration duration of approximately 20 minutes with a high vibration frequency. The intensity and timing of this treatment has been based on previous protocols, as previously justified in this project. Vibration therapy, with proprioceptive stimuli through sensors placed on the distal phalanges of the fingers, modulation from lower to higher frequency being possible\n* In the \"control\" group, they will receive the same 24 robotics sessions three times a week for movement, but without specifically receiving vibration therapy. Therapy will be based on movements.\n* Robotic treatment:\n\nAssisted therapy: It allows to carry out the movement by force of the fingers themselves, compensating the range of movement that the user does not perform.\n\nInteractive therapy: Allows to carry out active finger movement oriented to tasks or games. These can be configured to adapt them as much as possible to the capabilities of the user."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Activities, Motor","Quality of Life","Sensitivity","Upper Extremity Paresis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Upper limb","Sensitivity","Motor rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessments will be made by researches blinded for the patient´s group","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"They will receive 24 robotics sessions with Amadeo robot three times a week for movement, but without specifically receiving vibration therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic"]},{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"They will recieve three times a week with 24 sessions plus vibration duration of approximately 20 minutes with a high vibration frequency.
