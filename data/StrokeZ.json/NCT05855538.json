The main goal is to enrol a representative group of European patients diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) to analyse clinical and relevant parameters (digitalised ECG, echocardiograms, cardiac CTs, MRIs and blood biomarkers) that could be used during clinical practise for the diagnosis of atrial cardiomyopathy. The AF patients will be distributed in 3 groups according to the different manifestation of AF: paroxysmal, persistent and permanent AF.","detailedDescription":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke are major health care problems in Europe. They are most often the clinical expression of atrial cardiomyopathy, which is under-recognised due to the lack of specific diagnostic tools. Multidisciplinary research and stratified approaches are urgently needed to prevent, diagnose, and treat AF and stroke and preempt the AF-related threat to healthy ageing in Europe.\n\nMAESTRIA is a European consortium of 18 clinicians, scientists and pharma industry partners who are at the forefront of research and medical care of AF and stroke patients funded by the EU Horizon 2020 programme (grant number 965286). The Atrial Fibrillation Network (AFNET) is one of the 18 partner institutions in this European consortium.\n\nMAESTRIA will create multi-parametric digital tools based on a new generation of biomarkers that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) processing and big data from cutting edge imaging, electrocardiography and omics technologies. It will develop novel biomarkers, diagnostic tools and personalized therapies for atrial cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe MAESTRIA-AFNET 10 Study is an integral part of the MAESTRIA project. The study will collect relevant clinical parameters for AF from patients, this includes ECGs, cardiac CTs, MRIs and echocardiograms. Dedicated core labs will collect and homogenize the clinical data.\n\nFor atrial arrhythmias (AA) and vascular stiffness index (VSI) recording, patients will be provided with a measuring bracelet for continuous monitoring of heart rhythm with a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor coupled with a smartphone app and the Preventicus Heartbeats® analytic service (Class IIa, CE marked), approved as consumer device. Preventicus is ISO 13485 certified."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"optional extra blood for MAESTRIA Biobank"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Paroxysmal AF","description":"200 patients"},{"label":"Persistent AF","description":"200 patients"},{"label":"Permanent AF","description":"200 patients"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Physical examination","description":"Weight (Kilograms-Kg) Height (centimeters-cm) Weight and height will be combined to calculate BMI in Kg/m\\^2","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Clinically relevant changes in CT/MRI","description":"only if clinically indicated","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Atrial Arrythmias (AA) burden and vascular stiffness (measured by a measuring bracelet)","description":"AA burden and vascular stiffness measured by the measuring bracelet","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Cognitive function test (MoCA)","description":"evaluation of cognitive function (includes different tasks: visual/executive; naming; memory; attention; language; abstraction; delayed recall; orientation).
