Inflammation has been reported to constitute a major component of ischemic stroke pathology. The brain responds to ischemic injury with an acute andprolonged inflammatory process. Few studies have investigated the relationship between acute biomarkers of inflammation and functional outcome following stroke","detailedDescription":"This case -control observational prospective study will be conducted on 100 patients with first -ever acute onset ischemic stroke within 24-48 hours. Their ages ranged-years old (mean age ±years). All participants will be subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical and neurological examination. Complete neurological examination where the following clinical and demographical data will be taken; age sex, stroke etiology, presence of stroke risk factors (as smoking history , hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus , history of hypertension, history of transient ischemic attacks, history of myocardial infarction or any cardiac problems). Stroke subtype will be classified according to the criteria of Trial of Org 10172 in acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification. The clinical stroke syndrome will be determined by applying the criteria of the Oxfordshire Community Stroke project (OCSP). Stroke severity will be assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be measured at the time of admission. Brain imaging (either CT scan and /or MRI) will be performed after admission. Electrocardiography (ECG), Echocardiography (ECHO), Carotid and vertibrobasilar Duplex will be done for all patients. Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of complete blood picture (CBC), Random blood glucose levels, renal function tests (RFT), liver function tests (LFT), thyroid function tests (TFT), Lipid profile, Soluble CD40 Ligand and Neopetrin by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Soluble CD40 Ligand","Neopetrin","stroke risk factors","functional outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neopterin","description":"Neopterin will be measured by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neopterin level","description":"will be measured by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission","timeFrame":"Within the first 24 hours"},{"measure":"Soluble CD40 Ligand","description":"will be measured by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission","timeFrame":"Within the first 24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke subtype","description":"will be classified according to the criteria of Trial of Org 10172 in acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification","timeFrame":"Within the first 24 hours"},{"measure":"The clinical stroke syndrome","description":"will be determined by applying the criteria of the Oxfordshire Community Stroke project (OCSP)","timeFrame":"Within the first 24 hours"},{"measure":"Stroke severity","description":"Stroke severity will be assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be measured at the time of admission.","timeFrame":"Within the first 24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Onset is within one week\n* Confirmed stroke by brain CAT and / or MRI scan infarction\n* Exclusion Criteria:\n* Cognitive and mental changes\n* Recurrent stroke\n* Hepatic and renal impairment\n* Endocrinal diseases\n* Steroid therapy\n* Previous fractures\n* brain neoplasm,\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* History of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases\n* Malignancy,\n* Trauma\n* Surgery\n* Acute vascular diseases that occurred within four weeks prior the onset of stroke History myocardial infarction ˂3 months.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients with first -ever acute onset ischemic stroke within 24-48 hours","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sayed K Abd-Elshafy, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0020882413203","email":"sayed_k_72@yahoo.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sayed k Abd-Elshafy, MD","affiliation":"Associate professor of anesthesia","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Faculty of Medicine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Assiut","country":"Egypt","contacts":[{"name":"mohamed abdelatef, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0020882413201","email":"latif_mohamed@hotmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":27.18096,"lon":31.18368}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
