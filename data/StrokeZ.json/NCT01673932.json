Group A (early-treatment group) will receive transplant of UCBMC isolated from HLA-matched umbilical cord blood at Day 0. Group B (delayed-treatment group) will participate in 6 months observation before the UCBMC transplantation at Month 6. All subjects will be followed up for 18 months from enrollment at Day 0. Long-term follow-up will be carried up to 36 months if applicable.\n\nThe adverse events and safety parameters will be collected and recorded. In addition, the stroke scores , gait and brain MRI will be obtained before and after the treatment to assess the safety and potential treatment effect of UCBMC in chronic ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Brain Ischemia"],"keywords":["stroke","chronic stroke","ischemic stroke","umbilical cord blood","mononuclear
