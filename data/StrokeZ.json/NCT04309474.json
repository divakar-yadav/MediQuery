Treatment options for acute stroke are limited with many patients having residual neurologic impairment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elezanumab and assess change in neurologic function in participants following an acute ischemic stroke.\n\nElezanumab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. This 52-week study is \"double-blinded', which means that neither the participants nor the study doctors will know who will be given elezanumab and who will be given placebo (does not contain treatment drug). Participants will be assigned to one of two groups, called treatment arms. Participants in one arm will receive elezanumab and participants in the other arm will receive placebo. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in 45 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to elezanumab or placebo by intravenous (IV) infusion within 24 hours of \"last known normal\" (time when the participant was last known to be without signs and symptoms of the current stroke) and every 4 weeks thereafter for 48 weeks for a total of 13 doses.\n\nThere may be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of elezanumab will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, evaluation of side effects, and completion of questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","ABT-555","Elezanumab","EAISE"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":121,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Elezanumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive elezanumab dose A","interventionNames":["Drug: Elezanumab"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo for elezanumab","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Elezanumab","description":"Intravenous (IV) infusion","armGroupLabels":["Elezanumab"],"otherNames":["ABT-555"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Intravenous (IV) infusion","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Total Score During the Treatment Period","description":"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a neurological examination used to quantitatively measure the severity of acute stroke by evaluating impact of cerebral infarction on level of consciousness, gaze, visual field, facial palsy, motor ability of arm and leg, limb ataxia, sensation, language, dysarthria, and extinction/inattention.
