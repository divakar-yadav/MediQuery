At the same time, the genetics and epigenetics of each patient are associated with the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The study of the microbiome in stroke patients will allow finding new therapeutic targets for the treatment of stroke patients.\n\nFor the study, samples will be collected from those patients with ischemic stroke who come to the hospital while the study is being carried out, taking into account certain criteria: the patients must be over 18 years of age, have suffered an ischemic stroke (demonstrated by resonance or head CT), not have any additional serious illness or unstable medical condition, and not be included in clinical trials with neuroprotective drugs. On the other hand, the control group will be asymptomatic, and will be made up of people who have not previously suffered a stroke or a cardiovascular event and who do not have diseases that affect the digestive tract.\n\nThe main variables of the study are the risk of stroke and disability after a cerebrovascular accident (measured by mRS at 3rd month). Microbiota, genetic and epigenetic variables are also taken into account, such as the presence and levels of bacteria, dysbiosis, genetic polymorphisms and levels of methylation in CpG islands."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Gut microbiota","Stroke","Metagenomics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood samples and fecal samples stored with ethanol 96%."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke patients"},{"label":"Control"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Risk of stroke and disability after a stroke","description":"Use of the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), evaluted from 0 to 6 (where higher scores mean worse outcome), to asses disability in patients who have suffered a stroke and comparison over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with ischemic stroke (demonstrated by resonance or head CT).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients under 18 years of age.\n* Additional serious illness or unstable medical condition.\n* Inclusion in clinical trials with neuroprotective drugs.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Samples will be collected from those patients with ischemic stroke who attend the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau while the study is carried out.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Miquel Lledós, MSc","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34679815196","email":"mlledos@santpau.cat"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Israel Fernández Cadenas, PhD","affiliation":"Institut de Recerca de l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Institut de Recerca Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Barcelona","zip":"08025","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Miquel Lledós, MSc","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34679815196","email":"mlledos@santpau.cat"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"All collected individual participant data (IPD).","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL"],"timeFrame":"Starting 6 months after publication.","accessCriteria":"IPD will be shared for further analysis under request.
