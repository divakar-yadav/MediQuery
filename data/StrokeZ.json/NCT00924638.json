When a stroke patient is found to have atrial fibrillation (AF), the guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation due to its superior efficacy over aspirin for stroke prevention. Physicians can best optimize the use of medicines only if they can precisely and correctly diagnose a patient's AF. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the time to first AF by 6 months' continuous rhythm monitoring versus control treatment in subjects with a recent cryptogenic stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) without history of AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cryptogenic Symptomatic Transient Ischemic Attack","Cryptogenic Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cryptogenic stroke","continuous monitoring","implantable loop recorder","insertable cardiac monitor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":447,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Continuous Monitoring","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Continuous cardiac monitoring by the Reveal® XT Insertable Cardiac Monitor","interventionNames":["Device: Reveal® XT Insertable Cardiac Monitor"]},{"label":"Control Arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Follow-up at the same frequency, but with no Insertable Cardiac Monitor"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Reveal® XT Insertable Cardiac Monitor","description":"The Insertable Cardiac Monitor is implanted under the skin in the region of the thorax.
