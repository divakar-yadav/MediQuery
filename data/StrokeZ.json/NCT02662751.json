The first strategy is the current/usual strategy in each participating centre and the second strategy consists in starting the post-stroke/TIA imaging assessment by a whole-body, low-dose angiography and subsequently resorting to elements of the usual strategy if required.","detailedDescription":"The secondary objectives are:\n\nA. To compare the patient pathways between the two arms in terms of time to diagnosis, and duration of hospitalization.\n\nB. To compare the consumption of imaging exams (number and type) and total body irradiation between the two arms.\n\nC. To compare the diagnostic efficiency between the two arms in terms of detection of predefined lesions, and performance ratios.\n\nD. To study the thickness of the left atrial wall as a risk factor for permanent atrial fibrillation.\n\nE. To compare the distribution of suspected neoplasms between the two groups, as well as the number of detected incidentalomas.\n\nF. To compare the survival and the incidence of new cardiovascular events between the two arms at 12 months and 36 months.\n\nG. To compare the quality of life between the two arms at 12 months and 36 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Attack, Transient"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":260,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Routine Imaging","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomized to this arm will have routine post-stroke/TIA imaging assessments.\n\nIntervention: Routine Imaging Assessment","interventionNames":["Other: Routine Imaging Assessment"]},{"label":"LDWBA first","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to this arm will start their post-stroke/TIA imaging assessment by a low-dose, whole-body angiography (LDWBA).
