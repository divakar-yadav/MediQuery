Prior to the application of HF-rTMS, the motor point was identified that stimulates maximum thresholds on the primary motor cortex, causing flexion of the opposite index finger. If the cerebral hemisphere does not show a kinetic response even at the maximum stimulus, the motor point of the opposite hemisphere was found to be symmetrically changed. The intensity of the stimulus was 80% of the resting motor threshold, which means the motor eveked potential above which the first dorsal interosseous muscle can produce 50 Î¼V more than five times out of 10 stimuli. The subject sat on a chair made to hold the head. The stimulation was stimulated at high frequency (10 Hz) for 2 seconds, and the rest was performed for 58 seconds for a total of 200 times for 10 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["HF-rTMS and ML"],"otherNames":["High Frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(HF-rTMS)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"ML","description":"Motor learning was conducted for two minutes each in five sessions, and the first is the external rotation training to maximum range of the shoulder joint in sitting position. The second method is to stack cups by transferring them from the non-affected side to the affected side by transferring 25 plastic cups of five colors in sitting position with both hands inserted. Third, by pushing and pulling the ball forward and backward with the hands folded, the subject puts a 55 cm healing ball on the table in a sitting position, and pushes and pulls it forward with the upper limb. The fourth method is to insert and remove pegs from the peg board, and the target uses the affected side hand in sitting position. The fifth method is to tear a newspaper, in which the subject overlaps a newspaper on the table in a sitting position, holds it with the non-affected hand, and tears it with the hands of the damage.
