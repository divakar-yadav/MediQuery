Small vessel disease is a chronic disease and is thought to progress over time. MRI is the gold standard to diagnose small vessel disease, but data on MRI-visible disease progression are scarce. Complications of small vessel disease as well as location pattern, distribution and severity of these MRI small vessel disease markers differ according to the underlying phenotype. The primary aim of this project is to investigate individual small vessel disease burden progression detected by MRI in survivors or intracerebral hemorrhage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","CAA - Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy","Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases"],"keywords":["Intracerebral hemorrhage","Ischemic
