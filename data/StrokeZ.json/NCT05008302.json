Both patients and healthy volunteers were prospectively divided into three age groups: 18-45, 46-60 and 61 and above. Thus, the maximum range of motion (ROM), frequency of wrist and finger movements, and grip strength (dependent variables) were valued in three age groups and different starting positions (independent variables). The Hand Tutor device (MediTouch, Israel) and the electronic manual dynamometer EH 101 (Camry, China) for grip strength measurement (error of measurement, 0.5 kg/lb) were used.\n\nThe Hand Tutor allows measurements of the frequency of movement (i.e., the number of cycles per second, where one cycle represents the movement from flexion to contraction) and the maximum range of movement, which is automatically measured during the frequency test, were performed over time 10 seconds (sensitivity: 0,05 \\[mm\\] of wrist and fingers Ext./Flex), the frequency of movement (motion capture speed: up to 1 \\[m/sec\\]).\n\nThe test consisted of two motor tasks, carried out in two different starting positions: sitting and lying down (supine). During the first examination, the subject sat on the therapeutic table (without back support), feet resting on the floor. The upper limb was to be examined in adduction, with the elbow bent in the intermediate position between pronation and supination of the forearm. In the supine position, the upper limb was stabilized at the subject's body (adduction in the humeral joint, elbow flexion in the intermediate position).\n\nIn each of the starting positions, after putting the glove on, the subject was asked to make moves as quickly and in as full a range as possible. Finally, the measurement of grip strength with a dynamometer was performed in both analyzed starting positions, after completing the range of motion and speed or frequency tests. The upper extremity tested in stroke patients was the paretic extremity. In healthy subjects, the dominant hand was tested."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","age","grip strength","coordination movement","stabilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"To improve the coordination of the wrist and hand after stroke in three age groups.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The test consisted of two motor tasks, carried out in two different starting positions: sitting and lying down (supine).
