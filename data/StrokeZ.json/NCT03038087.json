The treating clinicians will be blinded to the data collection and SENSE device scanning as described below.\n\nAll eligible subjects must have the diagnostic head CT scan (CT) demonstrating hemorrhage performed within 6 hours of symptom onset. While ICH and TBI patients may be evaluated in future studies, this early feasibility study is limited to primary spontaneous ICH patients only, given the relative homogeneity of this population compared with the TBI population.\n\nEligible subjects or legally authorized representatives will be approached for enrollment. After obtaining informed consent to participate in the study, a baseline study head CT will be performed to establish the hemorrhage volume; and the SENSE device will be placed on the subject within 15 minutes of this CT, or as soon as practicable, for initiation of monitoring. This repeat CT (after the diagnostic CT) is necessary since hemorrhage expansion (HE) occurs early in the clinical course, and the hemorrhage volume may have changed between the diagnostic CT and placement of the SENSE monitor.\n\nAfter enrollment, routine clinical management will ensue in the emergency department (ED), hospital ward or intensive care unit (ICU) as appropriate. A standard of care head CT to evaluate for HE will be performed at 12 (±6) hours after the baseline study head CT. Finally, a study head CT will be performed at 72 (±12) hours to evaluate cerebral edema. Any head CT performed for clinical deterioration as standard of care between the baseline and 72 hour study CTs will also be collected and analyzed.\n\nThe SENSE device will be placed on the subject's head, and two small ink dots will be marked on the head corresponding to a known location on the device to allow for the device to be removed and replaced consistently throughout testing. The SENSE device will be set to scan every 10 minutes until the device is removed after completion of the SENSE measurement corresponding to the 72 hour CT scan. If the SENSE device is removed to perform the CT or SENSE monitoring is temporarily suspended, the SENSE device will be replaced; and SENSE monitoring will resume within 15 minutes, or as soon as practicable, after each CT scan. A SENSE measurement obtained within 15 minutes of each CT scan, or as soon as practicable thereafter, will be used for comparison with data analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke, Acute","Stroke Hemorrhagic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SENSE Device Monitoring in ICH Patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The SENSE device transmits a low power tailored electro-magnetic (EM) pulse in the radio-frequency range across the patient's brain and detects changes in the signal that may indicate intracranial hemorrhage.
