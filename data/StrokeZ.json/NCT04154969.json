Improving mobility, and in particular walking after stroke, is utterly important to reduce the risk of falling and is strongly correlated to higher patient autonomy and improved quality of life. During walking balance maintenance, is a complex function relying upon three modalities of sensory information. The sensory weighting process is compromised in stroke patients, so they are excessively reliant on visual information to control their posture. applying vestibular inputs, such as vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) habituation exercise, as part of vestibular focused rehabilitation (VR) is one of the methods to trigger sensory reweighting processes in post stroke patients. The VOR role in balance is to assist stabilizing images on the retina during head movement. It may be possible to explain the phenomena of head stabilization during gait in post stroke patients, as an attempt to maintain gaze stability due to reduced dynamic visual acuity (DVA) arising from decreased VOR function.\n\nAims The aims of this study are firstly to investigate the effectiveness of VOR exercise on gait speed and balance in post stroke patients with no dizziness, and secondly, to test the correlation between the efficiency of the VOR, as reflected by DVA and gait velocity.\n\nMethods A prospective experimental study, randomized controlled, double blinded (assessor and statistician). Sixty adults, 65 years and older, hospitalized in the geriatric rehabilitation departments at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel will be divided to control and intervention groups. The intervention will include physiotherapy sessions including 10 minutes dedicated to VOR habituation exercise, comparing to physiotherapy sessions with no VOR exercise.\n\nPrior to the baseline testing (T1), the participants will perform the outcome measures tests twice (two consecutive days) to determine the smallest real difference. Following this, the outcome measures will be tested at three time-points: before the beginning of the vestibular training (T1); three weeks later, at the termination of the vestibular training (T2) and three weeks after the termination of the training period (T3), to measure retention. For assessing gait and balance, the Dynamic Gait Index (appendix 1), the 10 Meters Walking Test (appendix 2) and the Timed Up and Go test (appendix 3) will be utilized. For assessing balance confidence the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) questionnaire will be applied. For assessing the DVA, the Dynamic visual acuity test will be applied."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["balance","gait","post stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"daily physiotherapy session as part of the rehab plan, which includes 10 minutes of vestibular exercize.","interventionNames":["Other: Physiotherapy including Vestibular rehabilitation"]},{"label":"control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"daily physiotherapy session as part of the rehab plan","interventionNames":["Other: conventional Physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Physiotherapy including Vestibular rehabilitation","description":"vestibular exercise (VOR TX1)","armGroupLabels":["intervention"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional Physiotherapy","description":"conventional Physiotherapy","armGroupLabels":["control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dynamic Gait Index","description":"scoring walking while performing deferent tasks, such as walking around obstacle, turn head while walking.","timeFrame":"10 minute"},{"measure":"10 Meters Walking Test","description":"timing walking 10 meters walking","timeFrame":"1 minute"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go test","description":"getting up from a chair, walk for 3 meters and back to the chair.","timeFrame":"1 minute"},{"measure":"Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale","description":"questionnaire for balance confidence in deferent daily tasks","timeFrame":"5 minute"},{"measure":"Dynamic visual acuity test","description":"assessing the Vestibulo-ocular reflex by quantifying the visual acuity during head movement","timeFrame":"5 minute"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nwithin 0-3 months of a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic; anterior or posterior circulation; not vertebro-basilar stroke).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nany significant medical illness or blood pressure at rest\\>110/200 mmHg; a Mini-Mental State Exam score \\<24, global; a receptive aphasia or an inability to follow 2-point commands; unable to walk 16 meters with no physical assistance.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yochay Noach, B.PT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+972-50-6798701","email":"ynoach@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sheba Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Ramat Gan","country":"Israel","contacts":[{"name":"yochay noach, B.PT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03-5303396","email":"yochay.noach@sheba.health.gov.il"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.08227,"lon":34.81065}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28919118","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"GBD 2016 DALYs and HALE Collaborators.
