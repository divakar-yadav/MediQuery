Despite spontaneous recovery, some degree of defect is often permanent. Currently, no treatment exists for such visual field defects.The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a type of electrical brain stimulation method, transcranial alternating current stimulation, in reducing these type of visual field defects in their chronic stage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Infarction; Posterior Cerebral Artery","Hemianopsia"],"keywords":["Controlled clinical trial","Electric Stimulation Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active tACS using DC-Stimulator MC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 to 30 patients will be randomized to the arm receiving the active transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) treatment using DC-Stimulator MC.","interventionNames":["Device: Active tACS using DC-Stimulator MC"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation using DC-Stimulator MC","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The same number of patients as in the active arm, 15 to 30, will be randomized to receive sham stimulation using DC-Stimulator MC.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham stimulation using DC-Stimulator MC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active tACS using DC-Stimulator MC","description":"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is administered using DC-Stimulator MC (NeuroConn GmbH, Ilmenau Germany).
