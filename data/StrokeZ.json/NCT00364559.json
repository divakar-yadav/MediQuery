In addition it originates expensive expenses in health care systems.\n\nICH produces damage by mass effect, then by biochemical ways which are activated and they carry to secondary damage. Many studies have been conducted for explaining secondary injury, now we know there are ischemic changes related maybe with changes in cerebral flow and metabolism, in addition to activate inflammatory ways. Many drugs and measures has been ineffective for getting best outcome, without success.\n\nStatins or inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase are drugs used in dyslipidemia, frequently for reduction in LDL. Experimental and clinical studies in stroke and ICH have shown improvement in outcome. The toxicity related to statin is myopathy and hepatopathy, both with low incidence without fatal cases. Rosuvastatin has been postulated be the most powerful with longest life and toxicity similar to another statins.\n\nWe have designed this study to demonstrate if the administration of rosuvastatin in the first 24 hours and by 14 days has improvement in outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke"],"keywords":["intracerebral hemorrhage","statins","rosuvastatin","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A, Active B, Historical Register","interventionNames":["Drug: Rosuvastatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rosuvastatin","description":"20 mg 10 days daily","armGroupLabels":["B"],"otherNames":["Crestor"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSSº","timeFrame":"basal and discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survivor","timeFrame":"within 1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men or Women \\>16 and \\< 80 years with ICH and hospital attention in less 24 hours\n* Confirmation by CT scan\n* Acceptance by family\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of stroke\n* History of neurological disease, head injury o psychiatric disorder with disability\n* Glasgow less than 9\n* Administration 24 hours before: fibrates, niacin, ciclosporin, azoles, macrolides, inhibitors of protease, nefazodone, verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone.\n* Use before hospital of: mannitol, barbiturates, corticosteroids, calcium antagonists\n* Any lesion which needs surgery\n* Allergy to drug used\n* cerebral death\n* Hepatic disease (Child B y C) or myopathy (or) history\n* Management in other Hospital\n* Pregnancy\n* ICH major than 60 ml.\n* hypothyroidism","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ildefonso Rodríguez-Leyva, Neurology","affiliation":"Neurología, Hospital Central \"Dr. ignacio Morones Prieto\"","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Humberto Tapia-Perez, MD","affiliation":"Facultad de Medicina UASLP","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital Central \"Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto\"","city":"San Luis Potosi","zip":"78240","country":"Mexico","geoPoint":{"lat":22.14982,"lon":-100.97916}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17899518","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Tapia-Perez H, Sanchez-Aguilar M, Torres-Corzo J, Rodriguez-Leyva I, Herrera-Gonzalez LB.
