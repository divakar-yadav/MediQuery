But the correlation between the mismatch, calculated by Coregistration mismatch method,and the clinical outcome of the patients with acute ischemic stroke is still unknown. so the investigators plan to conduct a prospective observational cohort study.","detailedDescription":"NIHSS,mRS and MR PWI/DWI/MRA are performed within 48 hours of stroke onset and final MR T2/flair image at ≈1 month. And then,Volumetric-subtraction mismatch and Coregistered mismatch will be calculated,respectively.finally,we will assess and compare the Volumetric-subtraction mismatch and Coregistered mismatch, and to clarify which method match the clinical outcome more better."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischaemic Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","mismatch","PWI/DWI mismatch","ischaemic penumbra","image analysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged eighteen or above\n* Acute middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke\n* Stroke onset within 48 hours\n* Included a complete set of initial MR images and final outcome MR images up to 1 months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of stroke in the past 6 weeks\n* Pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that could confound the study results such as a pre-stroke mRS score greater than 3\n* CT evidence of the following conditions before enrollment:\n\nSignificant mass effect with midline shift Evidence of intracranial hemorrhage\n\n* With contraindication to MR such as severe allergy to contrast media","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with acute ischaemic stroke admitted to ASU.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Jianghai Ruan","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100078","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Ruan jiang hai, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86-010-64289776","email":"ruanjianghai@126.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
