To achieve this aim, the investigators apply repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to different parts of the brain and evaluate the effects of brain stimulation on dual-task walking speed.","detailedDescription":"This study will enroll 12 individuals with a stroke at least 6 months ago. Participants will be tested across 3 sessions and each session will be approximately 1 week apart from each other. During testing, participants will be asked to walk under two conditions: single- and dual-task conditions. Under the single-task condition, participants walk on a instrumented mat such that their gait performance will be captured. Under the dual-task condition, participants walk on the mat while performing a counting backward task. The walking assessment is followed by a 12 minute non-invasive brain stimulation using high frequency rTMS. Another walking assessment will be conducted right after the brain stimulation session. High frequency rTMS will be applied to different neural loci, namely primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The walking speed under two different conditions will be compared before and after brain stimulation to different neural loci."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High frequency rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High frequency rTMS will be applied to different neural loci based on the randomized sessions.","interventionNames":["Device: high frequency rTMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"high frequency rTMS","description":"Participants receive 16 minutes (5Hz, 24 10-second trains with a inter-train interval of 30s) of high frequency rTMS applied to either primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at different sessions.
