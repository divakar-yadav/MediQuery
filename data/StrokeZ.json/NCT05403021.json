The GETCare program was mostly self-led and included five weekly module education topics: basics of stroke, caregiver skills, caregiver changes, meaningful participation, and community resources. Each module incorporated (1) individualized education, (2) goal setting, (3) skills training, and (4) community resource recommendations. The program was led by a licensed occupational therapist who is a certified stroke rehabilitation specialist. The occupational therapist conducted weekly check-ins via email or phone focused on answering questions, tracking goal progress, and assisting in problem solving.","armGroupLabels":["GETCare Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Perceived Stress Scale","description":"Scores range 0-40, higher score indicates higher perceived stress","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Perceived Stress Scale","description":"Scores range 0-40, higher score indicates higher perceived stress","timeFrame":"Post-intervention (approximately 6 weeks)"},{"measure":"Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-efficacy","description":"Scores range 0-100, higher score indicates higher self-efficacy","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-efficacy","description":"Scores range 0-100, higher score indicates higher self-efficacy","timeFrame":"Post-intervention (approximately 6 weeks)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Caregiver Strain Index","description":"Scores range 0-26, higher score indicates higher caregiver strain","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Modified Caregiver Strain Index","description":"Scores range 0-26, higher score indicates higher caregiver strain","timeFrame":"Post-intervention (approximately 6 weeks)"},{"measure":"Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-43 Profile v2.1","description":"43 items across seven domains: physical function, anxiety, fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and pain interference;\n\nScores range 6-30 for each subscale.
