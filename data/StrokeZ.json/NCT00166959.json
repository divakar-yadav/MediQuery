Impaired postural stability has been shown as one of the primary risk factors of falls in these patients. Research has shown that patients who have moderate level of mobility and stability are more likely to fall than those who have very good or very poor mobility and stability. Therefore, there is an urgent need for physical therapists, who are used to play an important role in improving balance function of patients with stroke, to be able to early detect stroke patients who are at high risk of falls, and to implement fall prevention training and education on these patients. However, to date, there is not any clinical assessment scale that can be used for early detection of fall-prone stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke patients","Falls","Reliability","Validity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"DEFINED_POPULATION","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* between 30 and 80 years old\n* first onset or recurrent stroke as a result of a single cerebral vascular accident (ischemic or hemorrhage stroke)\n* ever received medical or rehabilitation therapies at National Taiwan University Hospital\n* being willing to take the clinical assessments and accept the vedio record\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* having unstable vital sign, unconsciousness, or having serious cognitive, perception, and language impairment, and being unable to follow the order of the experimenter\n* having other neurological diseases(ex.
