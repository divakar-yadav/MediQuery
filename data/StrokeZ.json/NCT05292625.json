Traditional treatments have some limitations whereas preclinical data suggest that stem cell therapy is a promising regenerative medical treatment given the limited capacity of the central nervous system for self-repairs after ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that umbilical cord blood-derived Mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusion improves the outcomes of several neurological damage conditions, including stroke. These results encouraged us to initiate the phase I/II clinical trial aiming to evaluate the safety and the efficiency of UC-MSC transplantation in the treatment of patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke. This case-control phase I/II trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between 2021 and 2023. In this trial, 48 patients with neurological complications after ischemic stroke will be enrolled into 3 groups: UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route group (16), UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal administration route group (16), and control group (16). The UC-MSC group (IV/intrathecal) will receive two doses of thawed UC-MSC product at 1.5x106 cells/kg patient body weight with an intervention interval of three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The potential efficacy will be measured using these scales including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-NIHSS, Functional Independence Measure -FIM, Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS, Fine motor skills-FMS, 36-Item Short Form Survey -SF-36. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months post-intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells","Neurological Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.5 x 10\\^6 umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells per body kg will be infusion via the intravenous at baseline, and the second transplantation will be performed 3 months after the first transplantation and combination with standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication","interventionNames":["Biological: UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route","Other: standard stroke treatment and rehabilitation therapy"]},{"label":"UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal route","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.5 x 10\\^6 umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells per body kg will be infusion via the intrathecal at baseline, and the second transplantation will be performed 3 months after the first transplantation and combination with standard frailty treatment and supplementary medication","interventionNames":["Biological: UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal route","Other: standard stroke treatment and rehabilitation therapy"]},{"label":"control arm","type":"OTHER","description":"standard stroke treatment and rehabilitation therapy","interventionNames":["Other: standard stroke treatment and rehabilitation therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route","description":"Patients assigned to UC-MSC administration groups will receive two administrations at a dose of 1.5 million cells/kg patient body weight via the intravenous (IV) route with a 3-month intervening interval","armGroupLabels":["UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal route","description":"Patients assigned to UC-MSC administration groups will receive two administrations at a dose of 1.5 million cells/kg patient body weight via the intrathecal route with a 3-month intervening interval","armGroupLabels":["UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal route"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"standard stroke treatment and rehabilitation therapy","description":"Each patient can receive up to 30 days of rehabilitation therapy","armGroupLabels":["UC-MSC infusion via intrathecal route","UC-MSC infusion via intravenous route","control arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse events and serious adverse events","description":"To assess safety, the number of AEs or SAEs during stem cell administration (72 h) at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after discharge will be evaluated","timeFrame":"up to the 12-month period following treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score","description":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe neurological deficit","timeFrame":"up to the 12-month period following treatment"},{"measure":"Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score","description":"Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is a widely accepted functional assessment measure used during inpatient rehabilitation with the possible total score ranging from 18 (lowest) to 126 (highest) level of independence","timeFrame":"up to the 12-month period following treatment"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"The modified Ashworth scale purpose is to grade muscle spasticity.
