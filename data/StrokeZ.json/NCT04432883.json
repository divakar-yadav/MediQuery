Participants will have 4 assessment sessions and 15 treatment sessions. The TDCS will be to right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) (25 active, 25 sham) for 15 days. A combined semantic feature analysis/phonological components analysis treatment will be paired with the stimulation. Two assessment sessions will be pretreatment, 1 session immediately post-treatment, and 1 session at 3 months follow-up.","detailedDescription":"Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective treatments for the communication problems of Aphasia due to stroke that restore patients to higher levels of functioning, decrease disability, and promote higher quality of life. While language therapy for aphasia is effective, improvements are typically slow, and gains may be small. Noninvasive brain stimulation has been suggested as a method to enhance outcomes from language therapy. This study will examine whether outcomes for language therapy with brain stimulation are different from outcomes for language therapy without brain stimulation in people with aphasia. Our central hypotheses are (1) targeted right hemisphere HDtDCS (RH-HD-tDCS) administered in combination with language treatment will result in greater changes in naming accuracy than language treatment with the sham RH-HD-tDCS (2) RH-HD-tDCS plus language treatment will result in greater increases in communication within the affected hemisphere compared to language treatment plus sham RH-HD-tDCS (3) RH-HD-tDCS plus language treatment will result in greater increases in perilesional areas working together immediately post-treatment compared to language treatment plus sham RH-HD-tDCS"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Aphasia","brain stimulation","communication problems","speech and language therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Masking: Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: Active cathodal tDCS + Speech-language training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, 31 patients with stroke induced Aphasia will undergo 15 sessions of active tDCS (x 30 minutes of stimulation) combined with 1 hour simultaneous speech-language training on consecutive weekdays.","interventionNames":["Device: Active Comparator: Experimental: Active cathodal tDCS + language training"]},{"label":"Comparator: Placebo cathodal tDCS + Speech-language training","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, 31 patients with stroke induced Aphasia will undergo 15 sessions of sham tDCS (x 30 minutes sham) combined with 1 hour simultaneous speech-language training on consecutive weekdays..","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sham Comparator: Placebo cathodal tDCS + Speech and language"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active Comparator: Experimental: Active cathodal tDCS + language training","description":"Cathodal tDCS raises neuronal membrane potentials, leading to decreased probability of depolarization from incoming stimuli.\n\nSpeech and Language training involves a combined semantic feature analysis and phonological components analysis treatment.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental: Active cathodal tDCS + Speech-language training"],"otherNames":["Behavioral: Speech and Language Training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sham Comparator: Placebo cathodal tDCS + Speech and language","description":"Speech and Language training involves a combined semantic feature analysis and phonological components analysis treatment. .","armGroupLabels":["Comparator: Placebo cathodal tDCS + Speech-language training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Picture Naming of trained items","description":"Change in naming of pictures of trained items;
