However, in general, detailed cognitive outcomes in ICH have been neglected, possibly due to the high mortality rate of ICH (up to 60% within the first year).\n\nBlood pressure (BP) management in those with ICH has been suboptimal. Most hypertensive patients need more than two medications. Combination therapy may improve adherence and BP reduction and reduce cardiovascular (CV) event rates. In the main TRIDENT study, it is hypothesised that a fixed low-dose triple combination BP-lowering agent, termed the 'Triple Pill' will prevent recurrent stroke. The Triple Pill is composed of a single capsule containing either a combination of telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg and indapamide 1.25 mg, or placebo.\n\nIn addition to achieving optimal BP control, the Triple Pill also has the capacity to slow cognitive decline and dementia in ICH survivors. Research shows that elevated BP is associated with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, even after accounting for prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and large scale prospective studies have shown a 50% reduction in dementia when BP is managed appropriately"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Decline","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Dementia, Vascular","Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Hypertension","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["TRIDENT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Main Study: Multicentre, international, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial.\n\nSub-Study: Multicentre, international, single-arm trial","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Main Study: Participants are double-blinded.
