We propose a reeducation protocol based on an early over-solicitation of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles to promote their \"awakening\", limit the loss of strength associated with the functional loss and thus allow to reach a more effective walking activity. This should encourage social participation following discharge from the hospital. The main objective is to evaluate the impact of this 6 weeks program on walking speed.","detailedDescription":"According to HAS, stroke is the leading cause of disability acquired in France. If 90% of patients recover walking, it is often limited with a steady speed around 0.7m/s. This limitation of walking activity is partly related to a decrease in strength associated with more or less significant spasticity. In stroke, this decrease in strength is the result of central impairment. Rehabilitation therefore involves gestural repetition. Mentiplay's review (Mentiplay et al., 2015) showing the predominance of ankle muscle strength in walking activity, we propose a protocol based on repetitive mobilization of this joint during subacute phase to promote awakening control, to limit the loss of muscle strength and thus potentiate the recovery of a more efficient walking. The strength of this study would be to verify the effectiveness of such a program in a large number of patients (5 centers involved). Its originality is to measure the impact of this program on social participation.\n\nThe patients will be recruited in 5 centers during their hospitalization, in sub-acute phase. Two groups will be formed: a control group in conventional rehabilitation; an experimental group that will perform 5x/week 300 movements of plantarflexion, dorsiflexion on isokinetic dynamometer (in passive mode, with the intention of producing the greatest possible force). This protocol will take place over 6 weeks.\n\nFollow-up visits will take place at the end of the 6th week (which corresponds to the end of the ankle rehabilitation protocol), 6 months and one year after the beginning of the protocol.\n\nThese visits will include a clinical examination, a GaitRite carpet walking test, an isokinetic evaluation of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles strength and a SIPSO self-administered questionnaire (social participation) at 6 months and one year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation program 1"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation program 2"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation program 1","description":"Both groups will benefit from a conventional rehabilitation treatment including a repetitive walking.\n\nIn addition to this conventional rehabilitation, the experimental group will receive an ankle isokinetic program, 5 times a week, for 6 weeks (with a minimum of 25 sessions)","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation program 2","description":"Both groups will benefit from a conventional rehabilitation treatment including a repetitive walking.\n\nThe control group will have a supplement in conventional rehabilitation equal to the additional time of the experimental group.","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking speed","description":"10 m walking speed measured at the end of intervention","timeFrame":"Week 6"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Social participation","description":"Social participation will be analyzed by specific questionnaire, the Subjective Index of Physical and Social Outcome (SIPSO) at S26 (26th week) and S52 (52th week).","timeFrame":"Week 26, Week 52"},{"measure":"Walking spatio-temporal parameters","description":"The parameters will be measured using a treadmill at each assessment (week 0, week 6, week 26, week 52) :\n\n* the duration of support phase (ms),\n* the duration of oscillating phase (ms),\n* the cadence (steps/min),\n* the step variability.","timeFrame":"Week 0, Week 6, Week 26, Week 52"},{"measure":"Walking speed","description":"10m speed: measured at week 26 and week 52","timeFrame":"Week 26, Week 52"},{"measure":"Dorsiflexors strength","description":"Dorsiflexors strength evaluated by isokinetic dynamometer at Week 0, Week 6, Week 26 and Week 52.","timeFrame":"Week 26, Week 52"},{"measure":"Use of technical aids to walk and the number of fall","description":"The use of technical aids to walk and the number of falls will be listed in Week 52.","timeFrame":"Week 52"},{"measure":"Correlations between walking speed /dorsiflexor muscles strength","description":"Correlations between walking speed /dorsiflexor muscles strength at Week 0, Week 6, Week 26 and Week 52 and walking speed/social participation at Week 26 and Week 52.
