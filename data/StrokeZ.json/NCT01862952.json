The pathophysiological mechanisms of poststroke epilepsy are not known. Subclinical epileptiform discharges could contribute to the neuronal damage and influence functional outcome. Electro-encefalography (EEG) is the golden standard to detect interictal, ictal and subclinical epileptic brain activity.\n\nPatients admitted to the stroke unit with an ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular attack will undergo a 24 hours video-EEG monitoring to detect epileptiform discharges. Clinical and paraclinical (imaging, serum markers of neuronal damage) parameters will be analysed together with the EEG results. The EEG results will be correlated with the occurence of epileptic seizures and functional outcome and mortality in the acute phase and in the long-term. When subclinical epileptic discharges are found on the EEG, patients will be asked to participate in a second part of the study where they will be randomised into a treatment (with an anti-epileptic drug) versus no-treatment group for a period of 6 months. Outcome parameters will be the occurrence of epileptic seizures, mortality and functional outcome.\n\nOur main hypothesis is that the occurrence of subclinical epileptiform discharges during the acute phase following stroke influences functional outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"antiepileptic treatment as used in daily clinical practice","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Antiepileptic treatment as used in daily clinical practice.","interventionNames":["Other: starting of anti-epileptic drug treatment"]},{"label":"No medication","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"starting of anti-epileptic drug treatment","armGroupLabels":["antiepileptic treatment as used in daily clinical practice"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Modified ranking scale and NIHSS","timeFrame":"day 7"},{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Modified ranking scale and NIHSS","timeFrame":"at month 6"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality","description":"medical records, seizure diary, interrogation of patient and caregiver","timeFrame":"at month 6"},{"measure":"occurrence of epileptic seizures","description":"medical records, seizure diary, interrogation of patient and caregiver","timeFrame":"at month 6"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with ischemic arteria cerebri media infarct and spontaneous intraparenchymal bleeding\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with subarachnoidal haemorrhage, traumatic haemorrhage (epidural/subdural bleeding), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, epilepsy, anti-epileptic treatment, transient ischemic attack, indication for urgent neurosurgical intervention","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Veerle De Herdt, MD, Phd","affiliation":"Ghent University Hospital, Department of Neurology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ghent University Hospital","city":"Ghent","zip":"9000","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05,"lon":3.71667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000000927","term":"Anticonvulsants"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M3936","name":"Anticonvulsants","asFound":"Prescription drug","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"AntiConv","name":"Anticonvulsants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
