We aim to determine feasibility of implementing stroke core measures and training through blended learning modules in resource poor countries to improve stroke outcomes.\n\nMethods: The project will be conducted across four hospitals in Pakistan in three phases. First stage will include retrospective collection of data for the preceding 4 weeks from start. In stage II, 3 months data will be collected before implementation of core measures. The stepwise training of staff will begin simultaneously, and data will continue to be collected. In stage III by the end of 3 months of stage II, core measures will be implemented as standard of care and patients will be enrolled for another 3 months. Outcomes measures will be successful implementation of the stroke care model as measured by survey done at the end and patient outcomes including in-hospital complication rates, length of hospital stay, patient and caregiver education, mRS at 3 months after discharge, post discharge complications and re-stroke rate. Data will be compared against published data from Pakistan and between patients in the first and last 3 months of the project. Statistical analyses will include appropriate mixed-effects multivariate regression models (i.e., linear and logistic) to model the relationship between clinical measures and patient safety. Degree of correlation across each symptom predictor will be measured. This study will not involve thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. However, the study will not provide any hindrance to implementation of such therapy and will not include such patients in analysis.\n\nDiscussion: At least one third of stroke survivors in Pakistan die due to recurrent vascular events and complications of stroke in absence of core measures. Prevention practices and stroke care are significantly underutilized in low- and middle-income countries but can be improved most efficiently by improving care delivering process without additional burden on resources by following American Heart Association \"Get With The Guidelines\" Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) program, Royal College of Physicians UK and European Guidelines, regardless of thrombolysis or thrombectomy. This feasibility study aims to develop a multidisciplinary comprehensive stroke team model with gradual integration of staff training, nursing care, therapy and patient education."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Retrospective 3 months cohort (admitted stroke patients)","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical stroke extended management pathway"]},{"label":"Prospective pre-implementation \"standard of core care quality measures\" cohort","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical stroke extended management pathway"]},{"label":"Prospective post-implementation \"standard of core care quality measures\" cohort","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical stroke extended management pathway"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical stroke extended management pathway","description":"1.
