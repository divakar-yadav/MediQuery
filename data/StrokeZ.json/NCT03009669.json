After the induction of general anesthesia, cardiac index(CI), cardiac output(CO), stroke volume variability(SVV), stroke volume index(SVI) were monitored with Vigileo system, while pleth variability index(PVI) and perfusion index(PI) were monitored with Massion Radical 7 system. During the surgery, goal directed fluid therapy was conducted according to the data of CI、SVI and SVV. Heart rate(HR), mean arterial pressure(MAP), central venous pressure(CVP), CO, CI, SVI, SVV, PI, PVI were recorded while after the induction of anesthesia(T1), making surgical incision(T2), performing intestinal anastomosis(T3) and closing the abdominal incision(T4).
