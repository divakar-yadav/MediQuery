Accordingly, efforts have been made to detect hidden atrial fibrillation and apply treatment using anticoagulants instead of antiplatelet agents. The conventional method used to screen for atrial fibrillation in stroke patients who did not have atrial fibrillation at first admission is 24-hour Holter monitoring. This study will compare the detection rate of atrial fibrillation with discontinuous ECG monitoring three times a day and 72 hours of single-lead ECG patch monitoring compared with the conventional Holter test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Holter Monitoring Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Holter monitoring is performed for 24 hours each at 1, 3, and 12 months after the diagnosis of stroke, and if atrial fibrillation is detected, the antiplatelet drug is changed to an anticoagulant.","interventionNames":["Device: 24-hour Holter monitoring"]},{"label":"Discontinuous Monitoring Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Discontinuous ECG monitoring by finger contact is performed 3 times every day for 12 months after a stroke diagnosis.
