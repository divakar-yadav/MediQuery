The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the effects of Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk functional capacity, balance and gait performance.\n\nOur study consists of two groups: Bobath-based trunk training group and, sensory training group in addition to Bobath-based trunk training. The information of individuals who agree to participate in the study and meet the criteria for admission to the study will be recorded with a demographic information form. The scales, questionnaires and tests determined to evaluate the individual's trunk position sense and functions, balance and walking performance will be applied before and after the study.","detailedDescription":"According to the definition of the World Health Organization, stroke is a clinical scene that develops due to vascular causes, causes focal or global brain damage, begins acutely, and progresses with neurological symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer. İt is stated that stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide. As a result of stroke, sensory disturbances may occur in individuals as well as motor symptoms.\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sensory training, which will be applied to the trunk in addition to Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk functions, sense, balance and gait. The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the effects of Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk functional capacity, balance and gait performance.\n\nOur study consists of two groups: Bobath-based trunk training group and, sensory training group in addition to Bobath-based trunk training. All participants will be randomly distributed (using software at http://www.randomizer.org). First, 12 patients will be included in our study and the total number of patients will be determined by calculating the effect size with the interm analysis to be performed later. Exercises will be applied to the individuals participating in the study 3 days a week, 8 weeks and 24 sessions in total. Exercises will be applied to the individuals after conventional therapy session. The information of individuals who agree to participate in the study and meet the criteria for admission to the study will be recorded with a demographic information form. The scales, questionnaires and tests determined to evaluate the individual's trunk position sense and functions, balance and walking performance will be applied before and after the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Stroke Rehabilitation","Bobath","Trunk İmpairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"single-blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory Training in addition to Bobath Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercises will be applied to the individuals participating in the study 3 days a week, 8 weeks, and 24 sessions in total.
