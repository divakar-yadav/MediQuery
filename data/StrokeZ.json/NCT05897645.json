Currently, despite vascular recanalization therapy, statins are one of the main drug choices for treating atherosclerotic plaque. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) can accurately assess the status of intracranial and extracranial arterial plaque, and has high consistency with histopathology. Thus, HRMRI technology has been widely used to monitor the efficacy of drug treatment for atherosclerotic plaque in clinical trials or practice.\n\nAs a non-invasive technique, HRMRI make it possible to assess the morphologic characteristics of vascular wall and plaque composition of intracranial artery in vivo. It can quantitative analysis including components such as lipid-rich necrotic core, fiber cap thickness, intra-plaque hemorrhage, calcification, etc. Therefore, it is crucial for evaluating the etiology of ischemic stroke and developing secondary prevention strategies.\n\nAt present, there is a lack of large-scale and prospective study to evaluate the etiology of ischemic stroke including cryptogenic stroke based on HRMRI. In this context, this study aims to establish a multi center HRMRI database of intracranial arteries among Chinese patients with ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Intracranial Atherosclerosis","High Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2110,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Registration","description":"collect clinical date, assess the morphologic characteristics of plaque"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence of stroke","description":"including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"360 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence of stroke","description":"including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"90 days, 180 days"},{"measure":"the composite events of cardiovascular events","description":"Cardiovascular events include cardiovascular death, stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and arterial revascularization","timeFrame":"90 days, 180 days, 360 days"},{"measure":"distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score","description":"mRS score range from 0 to 6: 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]","timeFrame":"90 days, 180 days 360 days"},{"measure":"The relationship between characteristics of intracranial plaques and functional independence","description":"characteristics of intracranial plaques includes plaque composition, location and morphology; functional independence is defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-1 (mRS score range from 0 to 6: 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\])","timeFrame":"90 days, 180 days, 360 days"},{"measure":"The relationship between burden of cerebral small vessel disease and functional independence","description":"burden of cerebral small vessel disease ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater burden; functional independence is defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-1 (mRS score range from 0 to 6: 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\])","timeFrame":"90 days, 180 days, 360 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.
