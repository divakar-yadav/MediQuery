These deficits pose serious barriers for stroke survivors to effectively manage their health and well-being over time, and has contributed to excessive amounts of sedentary time beginning in inpatient rehabilitation, and continuing post-discharge.\n\nSedentary behaviours are associated with various health risks. Lying down, sitting for prolonged periods of time, or any other activity with an energy expenditure of â‰¤1.5 metabolic equivalent units are associated with an increased incident of chronic diseases, as well as with reduced physical function, and increased symptoms of depression and frailty. Moreover, sedentary behaviours are associated with all-cause mortality, with each additional hour spent sedentary increasing mortality risk. Thus, efforts to reduce sedentary time as inpatients may be a promising therapeutic intervention to improve longer term health outcomes of stroke survivors.\n\nIssues with mood after stroke are common. After stroke, depression and depressive symptoms are common occurrences with as many as 28% experiencing depressive disorders or symptoms one month post-stroke, and 36% between two and five months. Similarly, anxiety symptoms and psychological stress are prevalent issues, with 23% reporting anxiety within five months post stroke, and 25% experiencing psychological stress. Not only are these issues associated with reduced quality of life, poorer functional outcomes after rehabilitation, increased healthcare use, and mortality, these psychological factors have also been shown to be associated with sedentary behaviour. It is therefore plausible that decreases in sedentary behaviours may be achieved via mood improvements.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) has garnered substantial attention as a cost-effective treatment approach in stroke rehabilitation, particularly as a means to supplement existing therapy. While the use of VR in stroke rehabilitation has resulted in positive outcomes, the outcomes studied have primarily focused on physical and functional rehabilitation. Despite evidence that VR is emerging as a method to address issues with mood, the use of VR to improve mood among inpatient stroke survivors has yet to be studied.\n\nObjectives: In this research, the investigators will: 1) evaluate the feasibility (e.g. recruitment and retention, administrative and participant burden) of a VR program to improve mood and sedentary behaviour in inpatient stroke survivors; and 2) develop an understanding of the effects of VR on mood and sedentary behaviours among inpatient stroke survivors.\n\nHypotheses: The investigators expect the protocol will demonstrate sufficient feasibility to support a subsequent larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). The investigators also hypothesize that the VR program will improve the primary endpoints, measures of mood, in people with stroke receiving inpatient rehabilitation, and that such improvements will reduce sedentary behaviour.\n\nThis 1-year feasibility study will use a parallel group, single-blinded (tester), randomized controlled trial that will be registered and adhere to the CONSORT guidelines. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either: 1) Intervention: 3 times per week to discharge of VR-gaming; or 2) Control: usual care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke, Lacunar"],"keywords":["Stroke","Virtual reality","Depressive symptoms","Sedentary behaviour"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Control group and experimental group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VR Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receives the VR protocol","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Virtual reality gaming program (VR-gaming program)"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Receives regular care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Virtual reality gaming program (VR-gaming program)","description":"Participants in the VR-gaming program will receive three 20-30 minutes sessions of VR-gaming per week for the duration of their inpatient stay.
