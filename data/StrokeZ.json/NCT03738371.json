Many steps are necessary to prepare this specialized procedure of interventional neuroradiology, including installation and preparation of the patient for this act. This first and essential time required the intervention of many health professionals.\n\nThe approach consists of a series of formation through in situ simulations for these health professionals, in order to improve and optimize this first step of the procedure (from the installation of the patient to the percutaneous punch by the neuroradiologist)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Time","Benefit of in Situ Simulation for This Kind of Training","Installation of the Patient Until the Percutaneous"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Team of health professionals","description":"Team of health professionals involved in thrombectomy (including specialized nurses in anesthesiology, anesthesiologists, neuroradiologist and technicians specialized in electro-radiology) will participate to in situ simulation.","interventionNames":["Other: In situ simulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"In situ simulation","description":"Team involved in thrombectomy procedures will be trained by in situ simulation.
