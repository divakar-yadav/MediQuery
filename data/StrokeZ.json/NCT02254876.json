Both components of the two groups were treated by four rehabilitation sessions defined as \"standard\". This involves joint health and passive mobility for the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints for a period of about 45 minutes each.\n\nThe patients of the sample group underwent the application of the NeuroMuscular Taping (NMT) before each rehabilitative session. The control group was addressed exclusively to the \"standard\" treatment. The sessions were spaced apart about five days to ensure the optimum adhesion of NMT.\n\nThe results were evaluated by administering rating scales for pain (VAS) and spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale). The ROM was evaluated using the manual goniometer. The outcomes (Pain, Spasticity, ROM) were assessed at base line, before and after each treatment session and at 1 month follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Painful shoulder Syndrome","NeuroMuscolar Taping"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard physical therapy program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard physical therapy program is delivered for four rehabilitation sessions for a period of about 45 minutes each.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard physical therapy program"]},{"label":"NeuroMuscular Taping (NMT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"NeuroMuscular Taping is delivered in addiction to the \"Standard Treatment\" for four rehabilitation sessions.
