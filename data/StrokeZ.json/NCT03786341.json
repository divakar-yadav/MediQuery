The investigators aimed to investigate whether walking assist device with auxiliary lser illuminator (laser quad-cane) providing visual feedback during ambulation could improve parameters of gait cycle and function among patients with chronic stroke.\n\nMethods: This was a randomized-prospective study and participants were recruited to each the experimental and the control group equally. Patients in the experimental group (EG) received 30-minutes rehabilitation, consisting of 15 minutes of walking training with laser quad-cane and 15 minutes of traditional physical therapy (such as strengthening and balance training). Patients in the control group (CG) received the same rehabilitation except that the walking training was by conventional strategy without lase quad-cane. The rehabilitation lasted for 4 weeks, twice per week. Gait parameters were measured by Rehab watch as primary outcomes and Berg's balance scale (BBS), timed-up-and-go test (TUG), and Barthel index were used as secondary outcomes. Both the primary and secondary outcomes were measured before the rehabilitation (baseline), 4 weeks (week 4), and 8 weeks (week 8) after the rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait","Stroke","Walking assist device","Auxiliary illuminator","visual feedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This was a randomized-prospective study and participants were recruited to each the experimental and the control group equally.
