While the negative impacts of post-stroke fatigue are well known, the knowledge of the causes of post-stroke fatigue and effective treatments for post-stroke fatigue are lacking. This small study will investigate the possible benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which uses small electrical currents supplied by a 9-volt battery, on post-stroke fatigue and investigate tDCS' possible anti-inflammatory effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Fatigue","Chronic Stroke","Stroke Sequelae"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomly selected participants will receive 20 min. of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation to the the top of their heads.
