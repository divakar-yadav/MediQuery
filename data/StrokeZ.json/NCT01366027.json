PBA occurs secondary to an otherwise unrelated neurologic disease or injury, and manifests as involuntary, frequent, and disruptive outbursts of crying and/or laughing. Progress has been made in better understanding this debilitating condition, but much more needs to be done. That's why a new PBA patient registry, PRISM (Pseudobulbar Affect RegIstry Series), has been initiated.\n\nThe goal of PRISM is to establish the prevalence and quality of life (QOL) impact of PBA in patients with underlying neurologic conditions including\n\n* Alzheimer's disease\n* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n* Multiple sclerosis\n* Parkinson's disease\n* Stroke\n* Traumatic brain injury\n\nBecause this is an observational registry, it doesn't require you to intervene with any specific treatment or procedure. Your participation allows the PRISM registry to collect and analyze data from your site and also compare it to national numbers captured in the PRISM registry about PBA across all of the major at-risk neurologic populations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alzheimer's Disease","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)","Multiple Sclerosis (MS)","Parkinson's Disease","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["pseudobulbar affect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":5290,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of PBA (using CNS-LS)","description":"The objective of the registry is to determine the prevalence of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in patients with certain underlying neurologic conditions: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Stroke (STR), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
