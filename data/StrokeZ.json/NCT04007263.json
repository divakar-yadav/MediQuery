Compounds of this drug class are hypothesized to be beneficial in a number of central nervous system disorders, including brain ischemia associated with stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, severe pain, major depression and substance abuse disorders. This study uses a double blind, adaptive design approach to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 5 once daily doses of NP10679 when delivered intravenously in three escalating dose levels in comparison to placebo"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Pain, Postoperative","Substance Abuse","Subarachnoid
