For the alternative treatment regimen (hydroxyurea) to be declared non-inferior to the standard treatment regimen (transfusions), after adjusting for baseline differences, the hydroxyurea-treated group must have a mean TCD velocity similar to that observed with transfusion prophylaxis.","detailedDescription":"Despite the clear results of the STOP and the follow-up STOP II trials, the use of chronic erythrocyte transfusions for primary stroke prevention in children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) remains controversial for many practicing hematologists, as well as for patients and families. Transfusions have proven clinical efficacy in preventing first stroke in children with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities, but their indefinite use may still be difficult to justifY.\n\nThe risk of transfusion acquired iron overload is now recognized as a serious consequence of chronic erythrocyte transfusions in children with SCA. After one to two years of monthly transfusions, virtually every patient will have excess hepatic iron deposition that warrants intervention with chelation therapy. The effectiveness of iron chelation has not yet been realized, despite the availability of the oral chelator deferasirox (Exjade®), due to its lack of palatability and increasing recognition of serious drug-related toxicities including renal and hepatic dysfunction. Simply put, indefinite erythrocyte transfusions cannot be viewed as adequate and acceptable long-term therapy for primary stroke prevention in SCA. There is an urgent need to develop an equivalent effective alternative therapy for the prevention of primary stroke in children with SCA, specifically one that better manages iron overload and improves quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell Anemia"],"keywords":["Phase III","Sickle cell anemia","Abnormally high Transcranial Doppler velocities.","Reduce risk of primary stroke","Pediatric patients","Chelation therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":159,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Therapy","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard Therapy of monthly transfusions"},{"label":"Treatment Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hydroxyurea will be provided as capsules or liquid","interventionNames":["Drug: Hydroxyurea"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Hydroxyurea","description":"Capsules (300 mg, 400 mg, or 500 mg) taken once daily liquid formulation (100 mg/mL)","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Arm"],"otherNames":["Hydroxycarbamide","Hydrea","Droxia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Difference in TCD Time-averaged Mean Velocity (TAMV) on the Index Side","description":"The primary endpoint for the TWiTCH trial was the difference between the treatment groups of the maximum TCD TAMV on the index side, calculated from a mixed model.
