Before to the table tennis session, the subject placed on the force plateforms, performs a spontaneous bipodal station followed by a maximum voluntary support transfer on the hemiplegic limb. During the table tennis session, the subject is filmed and his load on the hemiplegic side during the game situations is evaluated using the force platforms.\n\nIn addition of the table tennis session three questionnaires are administered to the patient in order to know :\n\n* The static and dynamic balance in order to identify persons at risk of falling: Berg Balance and Evaluation Scale\n* The degree of autonomy of the patient: Modified Rankin Score\n* The Stroke severity: NIHSS score"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke","Hemiplegic Gait","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To analyze the weight bearing on the hemiplegic side according to the different areas of interest of interest during the practice of table tennis.","description":"The vertical force peaks (Fz) under the hemiplegic foot and under the non-injured foot recorded during the subject's ball returns throughout the session.
