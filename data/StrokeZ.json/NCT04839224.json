Twenty percent of ischemic stroke is lacunar infarction.\n\nHowever, outcome of lacunar infarction is excellent, about 20-40% patients are suffered neurological worsening.\n\nProgressive lacunar infarction is associated poor functional outcome and neurological deficit.\n\nCurrently, no treatment for progressive lacunar infarction is recommended on the guideline.\n\nSeveral small study reported that phenylephrine and magnesium may be helpful for progressive lacunar infarction.\n\nCarbogen is a mixture of 5% CO2 with 95% O2. Carbogen is safe and it is used for the treatment of sudden sensory neural hearing loss or ocular ischemia.\n\nCO2 dilate cerebral arteriole and concentration of CO2 is correlated with cerebral blood flow.\n\nLacunar infarction is small and perfused with marginal flow by neighboring perforating arteriole.\n\nIncreased cerebral blood flow following dilation of cerebral arteriole by CO2 might halt and revert progressive lacunar infarction.\n\nInduced hypertension is alternative treatment of progressive lacunar infarction. Increasing blood pressure also induce cerebral blood flow.\n\nPhenylephrine is an α1 agonist, phenylephrine act on peripheral artery and little effect on cerebral artery or heart.\n\nSeveral studies reported that the effectiveness of phenylephrine on progressing stroke.\n\nTherefore, this study will compare the effectiveness of carbogen versus phenylephrine in lacunar infarction patients who suffered neurological worsening."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["CO2","carbogen","phenylephrine","lacunar infarction","progressive stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"1.

For the patients with neurological worsening after lacunar infarction, the carbogen group and the phenylephrine group will be randomized by 1: 1.\n3. Patients will be enrolled from April 2021 to December 2022 (based on the date of stroke).\n4. We will collect medical history, laboratory findings, neurological scores, and functional recovery.\n5.
