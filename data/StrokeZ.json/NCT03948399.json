The low ABI is a strong marker of generalized atherosclerosis. LEAD is a strong independent predictor for stroke. Significant ICAS is prevalent among patients having LEAD. Acute ischemic stroke due to significant ICAS has poor prognosis.\n\nPatients with LEAD may be a suitable subgroup for screening for ICAS using duplex scanning.\n\nEstimating the relationship between cerebral ischemic event and the ABI value could help better guide preventive and risk reduction strategies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","TIA","ABI","LEAD"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"STROKE GROUP","description":"150 patients admitted to Stroke Unit with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA)","interventionNames":["Device: Duplex scanning of carotid arteries","Device: ABI measurement"]},{"label":"CONTROL GROUP","description":"50 individuals admitted to hospital without diagnosis of acute cerebrovascular disease;
