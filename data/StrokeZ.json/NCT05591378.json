Hence the aim of present study is to compare the effectivness of Core stability and Otago exercise on balance and quality of life in patients with stroke.","detailedDescription":"The Otago Exercise Program (OEP), consist of resistance training and balance training exercises. The OEP is composed of three domains, namely muscle strengthening, balance training with a progression by increasing ankle cuff weights and number of sets, in association with a walking plan. It is a program that incorporates moderate intensity strength exercises focusing on the lower limbs and balance to be performed for about 30 min at least three times a weekStrength training consisted of flexion and extension exercises of the knee, ankle, and toe joints, as well as hip opening exercises to strengthen the sides of the pelvis. Balance training consisted of walking backwards, walking in a figure of eight, heel-toe walking, standing on one leg, walking on the heels, walking on the toes, heel-toe walking backwards, standing up from a sitting position, and walking up stairs.exercises and physical activities could promote balance, flexibility, muscular strength, and walking ability among elderly people.OEP three times a week, for 6 months, can improve dynamic balance.core stability exercises for five weeks in addition to conventional physiotherapy five days a week for the same period, improved dynamic sitting balance, standing balance, gait and activities of daily living at the post intervention assessment in subacute post-stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["balance","quality of life","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"core stability exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"improve balance and muscle strengthening","interventionNames":["Other: core stability exercises"]},{"label":"otago exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"improve balance and quality of life","interventionNames":["Other: otago exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"core stability exercises","description":"exercises for 8 weeks and 3 individual sessions per week for 30-45 minutes.
