contracture and the ensuing deformity, a major goal of rehabilitation therapy and produces movement in the affected limb from activating the patient's own brain, rather than from being acted on by an external powered source such as a robot.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Occupational Therapy (OT)","Device: m2 BAT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Occupational
