These features apply across various pathological conditions that alter the distribution of blood through the cerebral vasculature, such as aneurysm, intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) as well as others.\n\nNeurovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality due to stroke in the United States and encompasses a broad range of pathologies including but not limited to cerebral arteriovenous malformation, intracranial atherosclerotic disease, intracranial aneurysms and other neurovascular abnormalities. Novel modalities for assessing disease states in patients with these pathologic conditions are constantly being developed and the understanding of risk factors, disease progression, and effective therapy is rapidly evolving. Neurovascular imaging is at the forefront of this progress. The identification of new predictive biomarkers regarding the risk of rupture, progression, or recurrence will improve prognosis and treatment planning.\n\nIn this study, there will be evaluation of the various types of brain lesions and different treatment options that have been used by the treating physicians and, grade outcome based on the standard of care MRI imaging. This can help the Investigators stratify the treatment routes, that are better than the other by assessing the mortality and morbidity rates. Investigators are evaluating intracranial lesions and their treatment outcomes can help analyze which standard of care treatment is better than the others at a setting like Northwestern.","detailedDescription":"The long-term goal of this work is to reduce the incident of stroke by identifying the most vulnerable patients using MRI scans. Currently roughly 1 of every 8 patient who have had an initial stroke from intracranial atherosclerosis disease (ICAD) will suffer a second stroke within a year. Patients who are likely to fail medical management have loss of cerebrovascular reserve, poor collateral arterial blood supply, and/or inflammatory plaque that is vulnerable to rupture from active macrophage infiltration. Investigator's goal is to identify vulnerable patients to inform the selection for new medical management protocols or intervention with intracranial stenting or stent-less angioplasty. Investigators will develop a suite of novel MRI scans and evaluate them in the intended patient population, comparing to reference standard CO2 Challenge CVR, HMPAO SPECT, and to perform direct intracranial plaque molecular imaging for active macrophages.\n\nICAD is one of the most common causes of stroke worldwide with a high risk of recurrent stroke. ICAD patients with severe stenosis (70 to 99%) are at particularly high risk for recurrent stroke in the vascular territory of the stenosis (\\~12 to 20% within 12 months), despite aggressive treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), management of risk factors (hypertension, smoking etc.), and lifestyle modification. The use of new, preventative treatments including angioplasty/stenting or new anti-platelet/anti-inflammatory medications would benefit the most vulnerable patients that may be able to be identified with investigator's MR imaging protocol prior to the failure of medical management. Investigator's novel MR imaging biomarkers will improve the risk stratification for ICAD related stroke and recurrent stroke in this vulnerable, high risk population.\n\nThe Specific Aims of this study are:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To develop and validate an MRI scan protocol for quantification of cerebrovascular reserve that does not require externally administered physiologic stressors.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To develop and validate an MRI tissue perfusion protocol that can quantify the blood supplied through critical collateral arterial pathways.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To correlate dynamic contrast enhancement (Ktrans plaque permeability) and Fe- ferumoxytol uptake, as MRI biomarkers of inflammation (macrophage infiltration) in unstable ICAD plaques.\n\nUpon successful completion of this proposal Investigators will have developed three biomarkers of key risk factors for ICAD related stroke that will alter the management of patients in favor of earlier stroke prevention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["STROKE","PLAQUE","STENOSIS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1 - MRI Brain with CO2 inhalation","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"A research MRI exam that uses CO2 inhalation and gadavist contrast injections.
