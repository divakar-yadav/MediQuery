Electrocardiogram extraction based on the criteria of subjects.\n  2. Combined with extracted ECG data and National Insurance Corporation data (+ National Statistical Office cause of death data).\n  3. Health out of interest (HOI) definition. Includes death, stroke, etc.\n  4. The defined HOI can be extracted from Yonsei Medical Center data or from National Insurance Service data or Statistics Korea's cause of death data.\n  5. Artificial intelligence model training with electrocardiogram (and clinical information diagram if necessary) as input, utilizing supervised deep learning algorithms if there is a label and unsupervised learning algorithms if there is no label.\n  6. Performance evaluation for supervised learning artificial intelligence models.\n  7. In the case of unsupervised learning artificial intelligence models, the association/correlation between extracted features and HOI or predictability/detectability analysis.\n  8. Transfer learning can be performed by adding external verification or dielectric data to the learned model using public databases.\n  9. External verification can be performed using external additional data by mounting the learned model on a web-based artificial intelligence platform.\n  10. Considering large-scale data, computing workloads can be distributed using web-based artificial intelligence platforms.\n  11. The analysis results can be anonymized and the analysis results can be provided to researchers through a web-based artificial intelligence platform."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Health Status(Death, Stroke Etc)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients with Mortality","description":"Investigating the reproducibility of mortality prediction (number of patients who died regardless of any cause) from ECG data measured within 1 year before death using artificial intelligence algorithms","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"Number of patients with Stroke, Atrial Fibrillation, Dementia","description":"Investigating the correlation of certain patterns of ECG with the possibility of stroke/Atrial Fibrillation, Dementia using artificial intelligence algorithms.","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAll patients stored in the MUSE system after measuring a standard 12-guided electrocardiogram at Severance Health Checkup at Severance Hospital from November 1, 2005 to October 31, 2022","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients stored in the MUSE system after measuring a standard 12-guided electrocardiogram at Severance Health Checkup at Severance Hospital from November 1, 2005 to October 31, 2022","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Hui-Nam Pak","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82-2-2228-8459","email":"hnpak@yuhs.ac"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hui-Nam Pak","affiliation":"Yonsei University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Yonsei University Health System","city":"Seoul","country":"Korea, Republic of","contacts":[{"name":"Hui-Nam Pak","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82-2-2228-8459","email":"hnpak@yuhs.ac"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6535","name":"Death","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
