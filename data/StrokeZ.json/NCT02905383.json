The intervention consists of 32 group-based exercise sessions, performed twice a week. In addition the participants in the intervention group will be encouraged to perform an exercise program on their own, at least once weekly. The participants in the control group will be encouraged to exercise on their own, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on physical activity for adults aged 65 and above.","detailedDescription":"Older people who have been hospitalized often experience loss of function, increased risk of falls and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the post-discharge period. The reason for this is the cumulative effect of illness, bedrest during hospital stay and inactivity after discharge. Previous research indicates that exercise therapy should be an integrated part of the post-hospital treatment to prevent or postpone this functional decline and improve HRQOL. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a multi-component exercise program consisting of high intensity exercises on physical function, physical activity and HRQOL among older people living at home after discharge from hospital after treatment of an acute medical event."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chest Pain","Pneumonia","Transient Ischemic Attack","Stroke","Functional Failure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will perform a multi-component exercise program twice a week for 16 weeks.
