For this purpose, healthy adults and neurologic patients will participate in robotic motor learning experiments. Patients have a diagnosis of a neurological disease (i.e., stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) limiting arm motor function.","detailedDescription":"Neurological patients (e.g., after stroke) engage in intensive and expensive neurorehabilitation therapy to regain part of their former motor functional ability to perform everyday activities with often limited and unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitation therapy, providing cost-effective, high repetition and task-oriented training. However, results of an initial body of work comparing the effectiveness of robotic training strategies are highly inconclusive. A possible explanation is that most current robotic systems cover only one neurorehabilitation strategy (e.g. reducing or augmenting movement errors) and may thus insufficiently address the subjects' individual needs and the characteristics of the task to be learned. In this study, Investigators will perform several motor learning experiments with healthy adult and neurological patients in order to evaluate the relative motor and cognitive benefits of newly developed robotic training strategies that modulate errors based on the subject's age, skill level and tasks characteristics. The effects of the new strategies will be compared to classical robotic assistance, and to non-robotic feedback approaches, such as visual feedback. The culmination of this work may help to optimize training benefits of already existing rehabilitation robots."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Neurologic Disorder"],"keywords":["Neurorehabilitation","Robotic Rehabilitation","Motor Learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will perform motor tasks (i.e. movements) with upper limb robotic devices applying different strategies (e.g. supporting or challenging the subject, or being fully compliant).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Robotic motor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Robotic motor training","description":"The experiments consist in performing motor tasks with upper-limb robotic devices.","armGroupLabels":["Robotic motor training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in kinematic performance assessed by the robot","description":"Motion changes from baseline in the kinematic variables assessed by the robot and motion trackers during the motor learning task.
