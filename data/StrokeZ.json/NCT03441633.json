Its clinical efficiency in prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF (non/valvular atrial fibrillation) was demonstrated as well as has shown better safety profile compared with warfarin. A Drug Utilization study will evaluate whether this drug has been used in accordance with the approved indication and recommendations described in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and estimate possible misuse or overuse apixaban.","detailedDescription":"The primary research question is to evaluate the apixaban utilization according to the approved SPAF indication and recommendations by EMA.\n\nIn addition a comparison with a cohort of NVAF patients treated with VKA, dabigatran and rivaroxaban for the SPAF indication will also be performed.\n\nObjective 1: To characterize patients using apixaban according to demographics, comorbidity, risk of thromboembolic events (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-Vasc scores), risk of bleeding events (HAS-BLED score), comedications and compare it with the profile of patients treated with VKA, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.\n\nObjective 2: Describe the level of appropriate usage according to the posology recommended in the apixaban SmPC.\n\nObjective 3: Describe the potential interactions with other drugs prescribed concomintatly according with the SmPC recommendations.\n\nObjective 4: Estimate the level of apixaban adherence by the medication possession ratio (MPR) and discontinuation rates and compare it with VKA, dabigatran and rivaroxaban cohort.\n\nObjective 5: To analyze INR (International Normalized Ratio) values during the last 12 months and to obtain TTR (Time in Therapeutic Range) values in patients previously treated with VKA, and during the whole study period for those in the cohort treated with VKA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","apixaban","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51690,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1.
