Stroke and COVID-19 are related potentially putting these healthcare workers at risk of COVID-19 infection. In addition, prehospital providers need tools to help triage large vessel stroke patients to comprehensive stroke centers.","detailedDescription":"This observational prospective study will document COVID-19 status on patients seen in the prehospital environment for suspected stroke. This will provide an estimate of how frequently stroke occurs in stroke and also the exposure risk to providers in this setting.\n\nAdditionally, patients will have a headset placed to record their headpulse during the encounter. These measurements will be used to further develop an analytic model used to predict the presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke. This may help create a device that can be used in the prehospital environment to aid in the trade decision of destination hospital."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","COVID-19"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":486,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Device: MindRhythm Harmony","description":"Passive recording of the head pulse","interventionNames":["Device: MindRhythm Harmony"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MindRhythm Harmony","description":"Passive recording of the head pulse","armGroupLabels":["Device: MindRhythm Harmony"],"otherNames":["Cranial Accelerometry"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of COVID-19 infection in suspected stroke population","timeFrame":"Through Study Completion, an average of 6 months"},{"measure":"Quality head pulse recordings","description":"Proportion of head pulse studies deemed of high quality for further analysis","timeFrame":"Through Study Completion, an average 6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* suspected stroke in the prehospital setting\n* patient at risk for COVID-19\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* scalp laceration\n* Patient refusal\n* Prisoner, other vulnerable population\n* Prehospital provider feels that the recording may interfere with care","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients who are being evaluated in the prehospital environment by Detroit Paramedics/EMTs in whom stroke is suspected and who may be at risk fo COVID-19 infection","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"James Paxton, MD","affiliation":"Wayne State University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Wayne State University","city":"Detroit","state":"Michigan","zip":"48201","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.33143,"lon":-83.04575}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31591693","type":"RESULT","citation":"Smith WS, Keenan KJ, Lovoi PA.
