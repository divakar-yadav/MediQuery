Continued active life'.","detailedDescription":"Background: Elderly adults represent the majority of stroke cases worldwide. Sequelae after a stroke causes the stroke individuals to live a more isolated life 5 years after the stroke. This makes the stroke individuals an especially vulnerable group of elderly people regarding social reintegration. Reintegration into the community post-stroke depends highly on support from the family. However, the stroke individual's closest relatives are at risk of developing anxiety and depression.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a novel self-management intervention supporting older adults after stroke\n\nMethods/Design: Randomized controlled observer-blind trial. More than sixty stroke survivors over 65 years will two weeks before leaving a rehabilitation hospital be randomized to either a group receiving conventional rehabilitation (control) or a novel self-management intervention addition to standard rehabilitation.\n\nDuring a period of 6 months the patients will be offered additional 6-8 sessions of self-management intervention of 45-60 minutes duration by a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist.\n\nStudy outcome measurements: Stroke Self-efficacy questionnaire, Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale and Impact on participation and Autonomy and activity by accelerometers will be evaluated at baseline, three and nine months post hospital treatment.\n\nPatient, informal caregiver and therapist satisfaction will be with examined with questionnaires and interviews.\n\nDiscussion: Self-management interventions are promising tools for rehabilitation of self-efficacy, quality of life as well as participation and autonomy. The introduction of novel self management intervention in combination with traditional physical and occupational therapy may enhance recovery after stroke, quality of life and burden on relatives. Stroke 65+ trial will provide further evidence of self management strategies to clinicians, patients and health economists."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Self-management","Quality of Life"],"keywords":["Self-management","Quality of Life","Self-efficacy","Support","Stroke","Older adults"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":69,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mentor","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An independent centralized randomization database will provide allocation concealed to the involved clinicians and assessors.
