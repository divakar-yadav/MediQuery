The most common cause of disability after stroke is motor impairment resulting from brain damage which ultimately cause respiratory and functional limitation. Respiratory muscle weakness including the diaphragm leads to biomechanical change in respiration which can reduce vital capacity and total lung capacity of stroke patients. The weakness of diaphragm and abdominal muscle also leads to decrease in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) in stroke patients.\n\nRespiratory muscle training such as inspiratory or expiratory muscle training is commonly used to improve the respiratory muscle strength and function in stroke. However, it was reported that respiration is closely related to upper limb function because the muscle of upper extremities surrounds the dorsal muscle of trunk and in order to breath, the movement of trunk is necessary, which in turn is related to the movement of the upper limbs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Robot assisted arm training"]},{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot assisted arm training","description":"Patients will receive 30 minutes of robot-assisted arm training and 30 minutes of conventional arm rehabilitation training.
