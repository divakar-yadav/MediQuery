Antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy after catheter ablation determines the occurrence of perioperative bleeding and ischemic events. However, the incidence, characteristics and short-term prognosis of secondary acute cerebrovascular events in patients with arrhythmia after catheter ablation have not been studied. Methods: This study was intended to retrospectively collect and analyze the case data and auxiliary examination results of patients with arrhythmia who underwent catheter ablation. To evaluate the incidence, clinical features and short-term prognosis of secondary acute ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events in patients with arrhythmia after catheter ablation. In order to improve the quality of life of patients, reduce the secondary acute cerebrovascular complications in the hospital in patients with arrhythmia after catheter ablation, to provide evidence for promoting the clinical management of such patients, and to provide help for the maximum degree of prevention and control risk."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Arrhythmia","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["Radiofrequency catheter ablation","Arrhythmia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke group","description":"1.
