During clot-retrieval, simultaneous balloon inflation within the internal carotid artery offers transient proximal blood flow arrest, potentially preventing distal clot migration or embolisation to new vascular territories. Retrospective studies indicate that this may improve complete vessel recanalisation rates and may translate to improved functional independence. However, lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating the efficacy of simultaneous balloon inflation has led to clinical equipoise with heterogeneity of practice globally."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Occlusion, Cerebrovascular"],"keywords":["Stroke","Large vessel occlusion","Balloon guide catheter","Flow arrest","Mechanical
