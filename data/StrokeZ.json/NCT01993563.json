It included three subsequent steps:\n\n1. Implicit Motor Imagery training (IMI), using a body part laterality discrimination task\n2. Explicit Motor Imagery training, using pictures and videos for improving patient's ability in imagining movements\n3. Mirror box therapy, using a 35x40 cm mirror,\n\nWe are transferring this approach into stroke rehabilitation in order to improve patients' upper limb motor functions.\n\nAll the patients, in both groups, will be training 2 hours a day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. The first hour is standard treatment, the clinician in charge will decide treatment's priorities and the aim(s) of the treatment for each specific patient. The second hour will be focused on patient's upper limb function.\n\nThe treatment group will be treated accordingly to the GMI protocol. The control group will receive a second hour of standard treatment, centred on the upper limb. Standard treatments are decided by the interdisciplinary team and might include motor rehabilitation, bilateral arm training, virtual reality training or occupational therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Motor Imagery","Upper Extremity","Mirror Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Graded Motor Imagery","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Graded Motor Imagery"]},{"label":"Standard treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Standard treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Graded Motor Imagery","description":"GMI program includes three steps: Implicit Motor Imagery (IMI); Explicit Motor Imagery (EMI) and Mirror Box Therapy (MT).\n\nIMI included a training based on Hand Laterality Discrimination Tasks. During these tasks 60 pictures of right and left hands are projected randomly on a 15\" screen. Patients are asked to choose whether the images seen are right or left and therefore to click respectively the right or the left button on a mouse.\n\nEMI training consists in imagining a movement without actual performing it. It will be introduced during IMI's last two sessions and gradually enhanced increasing the complexity of motor skills to be imagined. The therapist shows or explains in details the movements the patient have to mentally rehearsed.\n\nMT treatments will start with simply watching the unaffected hand in the mirror and increased toward functional movement. When possible, gentle movement with the affected hand will be encouraged behind the reflecting part of the mirror.","armGroupLabels":["Graded Motor Imagery"],"otherNames":["GMI"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard treatment","description":"Patients will undergo to a standard treatment, that is thought to be the best option for that specific patients.
