One group will be experiment with conventional physical therapy as control group (CG), the other group will active cycling as active cycling group (ACG) with elliptical Cross Trainer \\& Exercise Bike after conventional physical therapy.\n\nBaseline assessment of muscle tone by Myoton-3, Modified Ashworth Scale used as a simple measure of spasticity; Barthel Index scale for performance in activities of daily living; Berg Balance Scale to measure balance; the upper and lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer assessment for motor function of extremities; and BTS G-WALK was used to measure gait parameters. The data will be collect before session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Post stroke","Gait","Elliptical cross bike.","Postural control","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomize control trials","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active cycling group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"effect of combine cycling and conventional physical therapy in quality of life, functional activity and ADL, postural control, balance, muscle tone, spasticity, motor functioning, gait of stroke patients.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: cycling","Behavioral: Physical therapy"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"effect of combine conventional physical therapy in quality of life, functional activity and ADL, postural control, balance, muscle tone, spasticity, motor functioning, gait of stroke patients.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"cycling","description":"Active cycling","armGroupLabels":["active cycling group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Physical therapy","description":"Conventional physical therapy","armGroupLabels":["active cycling group","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait","description":"Subjects were asked to walk at a self-selected speed using walking aids if necessary with 10 m.
