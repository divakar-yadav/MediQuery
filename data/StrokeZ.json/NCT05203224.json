All participants will receive intravenous tenecteplase and endovascular thrombectomy as standard care. The trial is a Bayesian Optimised Phase 2 dose-finding umbrella trial (single arm versus objective performance criterion of 20% substantial reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy based on the EXTEND-IA TNK trials NCT02388061, NCT03340493). The aim is to determine the optimal dose of intravenous dornase alfa (recombinant human DNase 1) with sufficient promise to take forward in a seamless phase 2b/3 design."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["thrombolysis","thrombolytic","endovascular thrombectomy","tenecteplase","dornase alfa","DNase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Bayesian Optimised Phase 2 dose-finding umbrella trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"No blinding given single arm study but Independent core laboratory adjudication of the primary outcome, mRS (secondary outcome) performed by central assessor."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intravenous Dornase alfa (DNase)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive a single intravenous dose of dornase alfa (at either 0.125mg/kg, 0.25mg/kg, or 0.5mg/kg in escalating tiers), administered as a bolus over \\~30 seconds.","interventionNames":["Drug: Dornase Alfa"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dornase Alfa","description":"Intravenous Dornase alfa","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous Dornase alfa (DNase)"],"otherNames":["DNase","Pulmozyme"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with substantial angiographic reperfusion or absence of retrievable intracranial thrombus at initial angiogram without symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","description":"composite outcome of reperfusion on initial angiogram (day 0 - expanded Treatment In Cerebral Infarction \\[eTICI\\] 2b-3 or no retrievable intracranial thrombus) and assessment of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage on brain imaging 24h post-treatment. eTICI 2b-3 indicates reperfusion of \\>50% of the initially involved arterial territory.","timeFrame":"24 hours post-treatment"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months","description":"ordinal analysis versus EXTEND-IA TNK I \\& II historical control, adjusted for age and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. mRS is a functional outcome/disability score from 0 (no disability) to 6 (death).
