Their are not study treatments or interventions, this is an observational trial. Eligible patients must be \\>50 years old, have a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack with a documented brain infarction within the prior 12 months. If patients are on anticoagulation therapies, they are eligible for enrollment if the long-term strategy for stroke prevention is anti-platelet therapy and not the oral anti-coagulant itself. Patients must not have an detection of AF and then must successfully activate the lifeStar device for enrollment. At the end of three weeks, the LifeStar device will be over-read and scored for the presence of AF and other clinically significant arrhythmias by the study electrophysiologist, who will determine the occurrence and burden of AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":49,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of any episode of AF >30 seconds during 21 days of mobile outpatient cardiac telemetry","timeFrame":"21 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Patient has been evaluated with at least a 12 lead EKG and at least one day of in-patient or out-patient cardiac telemetry, with no detection of AF or atrial flutter.\n6.
