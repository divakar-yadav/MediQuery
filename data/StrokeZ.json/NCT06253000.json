Ischemic stroke in patients with AF is often fatal and, compared with stroke of other etiology, leads to the most pronounced disability and more often recurs. Accordingly, the risk of death in patients with AF-related stroke is 2 times higher, and treatment costs increase 1.5 times.\n\nThe main interventional method of treating AF, available in most medical institutions, is the use of radio frequency and/or cryoenergy to eliminate destructive damage to the left atrium (LA).\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare two different interventional methods and identify predictors of recurrence in patients with persistent and long-term AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Acute Cerebrovascular Accident","Transient Ischemic Attack","Death","Atrial Fibrillation Recurrent"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","radiofrequency ablation","cryoablation","left atrium","the posterior wall of the left atrium","atrial remodeling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomized double-blind controlled trial in two groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":158,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cryoablation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cryoablation of the mouths of the pulmonary veins and the posterior wall of the left atrium.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Cryoablation"]},{"label":"Radiofrequency ablation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary veins according to the \"box isolation\" type using a non-fluoroscopic navigation system.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Radiofrequency ablation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Cryoablation","description":"Cryoablation of the mouths of the pulmonary veins and the posterior wall of the left atrium.","armGroupLabels":["Cryoablation"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Radiofrequency ablation","description":"Radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary veins according to the \"box isolation\" type using a non-fluoroscopic navigation system.","armGroupLabels":["Radiofrequency ablation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral events","description":"The number of patients who had a stroke or acute cerebrovascular accident or a transient ischemic attack within 24 months after ablation.","timeFrame":"From the date of ablation until the date of the event, assessed up to 24 months."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hospital mortality","description":"The number of patients who died in the hospital.","timeFrame":"From the date of ablation until the date of death, assessed up to 5 days."},{"measure":"Non-lethal events","description":"Number of participants with non-lethal events.
