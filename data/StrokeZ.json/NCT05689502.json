These sessions will include 2 hours of occupational therapy, 2 hours of physical therapy, and 2 hours of guided individual work. Some of these sessions will be in a group setting. The therapy sessions will be individualized to the subject's personal goals and will focus on improving the function of the arm most affected by the stroke. Sessions may include electrical stimulation of the muscles, if it is determined to be safe. At the end of each week, the therapists will recommend exercises for the subjects to continue to work on at home on the weekend.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in integrity of the contralateral corticospinal tract fibers as assessed by the MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) evaluation","timeFrame":"Baseline(1 week prior to intervention),within 1 week after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in functional arm movements as assessed by the Fugl Meyer-Upper Extremity Assessment","description":"This is a 66 item questionnaire and each is scored from 0(cannot perform)-2(performs fully) a higher score indicating better outcome","timeFrame":"Baseline (1 week prior to the intervention), within 1 week after the intervention, 6 weeks after intervention, 6 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in functional gross and fine motor coordination as assessed by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","description":"This test has 4 subscales and each measures grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement.\n\nThe Grasp subscale has 6 questions and is scored from 0-18, higher score indicating better outcome The Grip subscale has 4 items and is scored from 0-12, higher score indicating better outcome The Pinch subscale has 6 items and is scored from 0-18, higher score indicating better outcome The Gross movement subscale has 3 items and is scored from 0-9, higher score indicating better outcome","timeFrame":"Baseline (1 week prior to the intervention), within 1 week after the intervention, 6 weeks after intervention, 6 months after intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in degree of disability as assessed by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"mRS is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores from 0(no disability) to 5(disability requiring constant care) a higher score indicating more disability","timeFrame":"Baseline (1 week prior to the intervention), within 1 week after the intervention, 6 weeks after intervention, 6 months after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in performance in activities of daily living as assessed by the Barthel Index (BI)","description":"This is a scoring technique that measures performance in ten activities of daily living including feeding, wheelchair to bed transfers, grooming ,chair to toilet transfers, walking, using stairs, dressing, and continence of bowels and bladder.
