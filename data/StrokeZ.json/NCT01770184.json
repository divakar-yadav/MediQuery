Self-management intervention has been proven to be an effective intervention to increase healthy behaviors, improve overall health status, decrease healthcare utilization/cost, decrease depressive symptoms, and improve participation in people with a variety of chronic conditions; however, it has never be used with individuals with mild stroke. The critical next step and goal of this study is to evaluate if self-management intervention will improve health outcomes for persons with mild stroke. The overall hypothesis of this study is that self-management intervention will improve outcomes in the mild-stroke population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Chronic Disease"],"keywords":["Self-management","Rehabilitation","Occupational Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will receive the rehabilitation services and support that is recommended and provided in the current health care structure.
