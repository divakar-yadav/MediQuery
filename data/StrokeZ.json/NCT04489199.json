Thus, the number of stroke survivors has increased by 90% between the 1980s and today. This raises new issues: risk of vascular recurrence, drug iatrogeny, and functional impact of stroke for motor, cognitive or thymic function. In the absence of available data in France, the investigators wish to set up an extended cohort follow-up of patients in order to study their long-term prognosis and to study the impact of future therapies on the evolutionary course of the disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA, Dijon Registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patient","description":"Patient included in the Dijon Stroke Registry.","interventionNames":["Other: Questionnaire and semi-structured interview"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaire and semi-structured interview","description":"questionnaire submitted by telephone 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years after the stroke/TIA. interview duration 20 to 40 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patient"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death rate","timeFrame":"Trough study completion, an average of 10 years"},{"measure":"Disability rate","timeFrame":"Trough study completion, an average of 10 years"},{"measure":"Quality of Life Questionnaire","timeFrame":"Trough study completion, an average of 10 years"},{"measure":"Neuropsychological questionnaire","timeFrame":"Trough study completion, an average of 10 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients included in the Dijon Stroke Registry and not opposed to participating\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* minor patients; opposition to participation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients included in the Dijon Stroke Registry","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yannick BEJOT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03.80.29.37.53","phoneExt":"+33","email":"yannick.bejo@chu-dijon.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chu Dijon Bourgogne","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Dijon","zip":"21000","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Yannick BEJOT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03.80.29.37.53","phoneExt":"+33","email":"yannick.bejo@chu-dijon.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
