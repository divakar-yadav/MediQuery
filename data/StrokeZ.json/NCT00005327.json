MRI, MRA, TCD, and standardized neurologic and psychometric examinations were performed yearly in a cohort of homozygous Hb SS children enrolled at 2-4 years of age. Subjects without MRI evidence of cerebral infarction who had significant cerebral vasculopathy (cerebral arterial stenosis on MRA and/or elevated blood flow velocity on TCD) were randomized to receive either no therapy or chronic transfusion therapy, in order to determine the risk of subsequent cerebral infarction in untreated subjects with these abnormalities, and the extent to which transfusion therapy could significantly reduce the risk. Subjects with evidence of prior cerebral infarction on MRI, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, were randomized to receive either chronic transfusion therapy alone ('standard therapy') or chronic transfusion therapy plus ticlopidine, in order to determine whether ticlopidine could significantly increase the efficacy of standard therapy in preventing recurrent cerebral infarction in SCA. Subjects with prior cerebral infarction were also offered the option of bone marrow transplantation if an HLA-identical non-SS sibling donor was available."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anemia, Sickle Cell","Blood Disease","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL"},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"No eligibility criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Darleen Powars","affiliation":"University of Southern California"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"9864148","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Powars DR, Conti PS, Wong WY, Groncy P, Hyman C, Smith E, Ewing N, Keenan RN, Zee CS, Harold Y, Hiti AL, Teng EL, Chan LS.
