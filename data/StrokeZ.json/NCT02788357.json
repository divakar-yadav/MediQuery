However, the number of patients in clinical trials who have received physical therapy and amphetamine is very small, for two reasons: because amphetamine may interact with many other medications that stroke patients are already taking, and because its potential for addiction precludes its use on a daily basis. The investigators now wish to evaluate the effectiveness of a more selective medication, atomoxetine, known to have many fewer side effects and no potential for drug addiction. The proposed mechanism by which amphetamine enhances recovery is by increasing central levels of norepinephrine. While the investigators already know that this drug is more selective than amphetamine, the investigators would like to evaluate its effects on hand motor learning and motor recovery in chronic stroke patients in a clinical setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atomoxetine Hydrochloride","Placebos"],"keywords":["motor training","motor recovery","human","neuroplasticity","transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atomoxetine with motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"40 mg atomoxetine paired with task-oriented therapy for 10 consecutive weekdays","interventionNames":["Drug: Atomoxetine"]},{"label":"Placebo with motor training","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo capsules paired with task-oriented therapy for 10 consecutive weekdays","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atomoxetine","description":"Subjects will receive a single daily oral dose of 40 mg of atomoxetine.
