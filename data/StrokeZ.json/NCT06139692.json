Research has shown that both sedation methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and there is no consensus on how to choose between them. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial to scientifically evaluate the safety and efficacy of different perioperative sedation methods during endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in AIS patients with large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and hopes to contribute to the advancement of EVT in clinical practice.\n\nIn this trial, acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation within 24 hours of symptom onset or last known well will be included. In the screening stage, participants who meet the inclusion criteria of the trial, upon completion of screening/baseline assessment and after signing the informed consent, will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups: the dexmedetomidine and midazolam conscious sedation groups. The primary end point is the proportion of modified Ranking score of 0-2 at 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":810,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"the dexmedetomidine group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the experimental group, dexmedetomidine is used for intraoperative sedation.
