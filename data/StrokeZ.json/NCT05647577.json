The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Using conventional echocardiography, the investigators aim to determine the prevalence of overt and asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction in a large random sample of outpatients with IA. Cardiac dysfunction will be evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers (NT-pro-BNP, hs-TNT and hs-CRP).\n* In patients without known heart disease: Using 2, 5 and 10 year follow-up, the investigators aim to examine if advanced echocardiography can be used to detect early signs of heart disease by investigating the clinical significance of adding deformation measures - alone and in combination with selected biomarkers - to conventional risk factors in the cardiac risk assessment of patients with IA\n\nParticipants will undergo an echocardiographic examination in combination with a general health assessment including obtainment of cardiac biomarkers and a electrocardiogram.\n\nUsing advanced echocardiography - Tissue Doppler Imaging, 2- dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography, 3D-echocardiography and 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography - the investigators also aim to compare myocardial deformation parameters of patients with IA to a gender and age matched control group without IA from the Copenhagen City Heart Study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Inflammatory Arthritis","Rheumatoid Arthritis","Spondylitis, Ankylosing","Axial Spondyloarthritis","Spondyloarthritis","Heart Failure","Ischemic Heart Disease","Valvular Heart Disease","Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction","Heart Failure, Systolic","Heart Failure, Diastolic","Myocardial Infarction","Myocardial Dysfunction","Cardiac Disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"whole blood and serum"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Inflammatory arthritis patients","description":"Patients with an confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis."},{"label":"Participants from the general population","description":"Patients with inflammatory arthritis will be compared to community-dwelling individuals from the 4th and 5th examination round from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02993172, I-Suite no. 03741, National Committee on Health Research Ethics approval HEH-2015-045)."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular mortality","timeFrame":"2-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Cardiovascular mortality","timeFrame":"5-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Cardiovascular mortality","timeFrame":"10 year outcome"},{"measure":"Admission with congestive heart failure","timeFrame":"2-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Admission with congestive heart failure","timeFrame":"5-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Admission with congestive heart failure","timeFrame":"10 years"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"2-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"5-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"10 years"},{"measure":"Revascularization","description":"Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft","timeFrame":"2-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Revascularization","description":"Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft","timeFrame":"5-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Revascularization","description":"Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft","timeFrame":"10-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Incident Heart Failure","timeFrame":"2-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Incident Heart Failure","timeFrame":"5-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Incident Heart Failure","timeFrame":"10-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Incident valvular disease","timeFrame":"2-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Incident valvular disease","timeFrame":"5-year follow-up"},{"measure":"Incident valvular disease","timeFrame":"10-year follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persons with a diagnosis of with a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid Arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persons not able to cooperate\n* Persons unable understand and sign \"informed consent\"","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"In order to approximate a random sample as accurate as possible, all patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid Arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis followed in DANBIO in the capital region of Denmark will be eligible to participate.
