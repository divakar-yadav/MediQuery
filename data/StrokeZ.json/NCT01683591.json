By using the stroke registry of our hospital, we will evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia screening in Acute Stroke using High-resolution impedance manometry (DASH). The hypothesis tested in this study is that high-resolution impedance manometry (HRiM) can provide the clinical efficacy to evaluate dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"The hypothesis tested in this study was that high-resolution manometry can provide the clinical efficacy to evaluate dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients. By using of stroke registry of our hospital, we assessed feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia screening in Acute Stroke using High-resolution impedance manometry in patients with acute stroke.\n\nThe registry had the contents of two evaluation steps; the first step was the process to identify the patients with risk of possible aspiration and the second step was for detection of silent aspirators.\n\nFirstly, the patient was interviewed regarding difficulties with food intake, chewing and swallowing, and the neurological signs were confirmed by two independent neurologists. After then, the patients were stratified into three aspiration risk group and controlled by proper diet program. Finally the emergence of aspiration pneumonia was observed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute stroke","Dysphagia","High-resolution manometry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":293,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-risk aspiration group","description":"Among the consecutive stroke patients, categorized to high-risk group in the patient (1) was not on alert mentality (from drowsy to comatose mentality), (2) was not able to sit upright or control his/her head, and (3) failed to pass indirect water swallow test."},{"label":"Low-risk aspiration group","description":"Patents without oropharyngeal neurologic signs"},{"label":"Intermediate-risk aspiration group","description":"If any one of following was positive, categorized to intermediate-risk group; (1) dysarthria, (2) motor aphasia, (3) inability to close and open lips or (4) facial weakness, (5) tongue deviation or (6) uvula deviation, (7) loss of gag reflex, and (8) inability to cough voluntarily.","interventionNames":["Procedure: High-resolution impedance manometry test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"High-resolution impedance manometry test","description":"The test was performed as general guideline for high-resolution impedance manometry test.
