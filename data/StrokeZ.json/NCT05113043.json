Maintaining the balance of the intestinal microbiota are expected to bring new breakthroughs for prevention and treatment of stroke. In recent years, stroke in young adults has an increasing incidence and a considerable socioeconomic impact because of high disability rate and health-care costs. So there is an urgent need to explore the role and mechanism of intestinal microecology imbalance in stroke, especially in the development and prognosis of stroke in young people. This study aims to use multi-omics technologies, including microbial diversity, metagenomics and metabonomics, to reveal the characteristics of intestinal flora in young stroke patients, identify biomarkers for predicting outcome after stroke and early detection of young people at high risk of stroke, and to further explore the role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","hemorrhagic stroke","intestinal microecology","multi-omics analysis","prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Faecal samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke","description":"Young patients who suffered from acute ischemic stroke within 12 hours for the first time before entry into the study."},{"label":"Hemorrhagic stroke","description":"Young patients who suffered from acute hemorrhagic stroke within 12 hours for the first time before entry into the study."},{"label":"Healthy Controls","description":"Healthy young people"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale scores","description":"0 = No symptoms; 1 = No significant disability.
