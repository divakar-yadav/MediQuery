This research study is looking at handwriting, a fine-motor task that is used daily.\n\nIn our study, we want to see if 3-dimensional robotic-assisted repetitive motion training can be a safe and effective intervention for school-age children with fine motor deficits arising from several different impairment origins. Our research construct is: Legible handwriting = function of (tactile feedback, visual feedback, duration, and fine-motor control).\n\nIndependent variables:\n\n* Tactile feedback is a continuous variable of force-feedback measured in pounds of force.\n* Duration is a continuous variable measured in seconds and number of repetitions.\n* Visual feedback is the letter scribed on the paper.\n\nDependent variable:\n\n* Legible handwriting will be measured by scoring on the Test of Handwriting Skills and the Print Tool™ evaluation.\n* Fine motor deficit/control will be measured directly and objectively by quantifying the error between the desired scribing task and the actual scribing task.\n\nThe robotic device is an affordable (\\<$200) computer haptic (the Falcon(R)) that currently is approved by the FCC for home and office. It is \\*not\\* approved for medical use. This is an investigational, nonsignificant risk device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Asperger's Syndrome","Dyslexia","Cerebral Palsy","Attention Deficit Disorder","ADHD","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["haptic","rehabilitation","fine-motor skill","handwriting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":176,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Handwriting without Tears","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard practice"},{"label":"Haptic guidance","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: My Scrivener(R)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"My Scrivener(R)","description":"Twenty 20-minute sessions of the Handwriting Without Tears(R) instructional handwriting program, with substitution of hand-over-hand or self-generated repetitive motion writing by computer guided repetitive motion.","armGroupLabels":["Haptic guidance"],"otherNames":["My Scrivener","Falcon, by Novint Technologies","Handwriting Without Tears"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Beery Motor Coordination Subtest","timeFrame":"after 20 interventions"},{"measure":"Print Tool and Cursive Tool","timeFrame":"after 20 interventions"},{"measure":"Deviations from desired 3-D writing path","timeFrame":"after 5, 10, 15, 20 interventions"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brief Assessment of Fine Motor Skills","timeFrame":"after 20 interventions"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Meet the following base prerequisites for writing: orientation to written language; eye-hand coordination, single handed utensil or tool manipulation (BAMF score \\>= 6), recognize all letters of the alphabet (unless the child has dyslexia).\n* Children have illegible printing for their grade, or legible printing but a speed less than the norms for their grade and sex.\n* Be able to grasp a pen.\n* Be able to speak and understand English.\n* Be able to follow instructions.\n* Be able to devote at least 20 minutes to the assigned tasks (short breaks will be allowed).\n* Be enrolled in school at grade K or above.\n* A score lower than 80% on the Print Tool™ or the Cursive Tool.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unable to pass the informed assent screener.\n* Unwilling to sign or mark the informed assent documents.\n* Uncontrolled spasticity.\n* A BAMF score lower than 6 (includes severe paralysis of the upper extremity).\n* Cerebral palsy other than hemiplegia cerebral palsy\n* Severe autism or intellectual disabilities that prevent productive interactions with the investigator","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"5 Years","maximumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Susan E Palsbo, PhD","affiliation":"Obslap Research LLC","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Susan Palsbo","city":"Eugene","state":"Oregon","zip":"97405","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":44.05207,"lon":-123.08675}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18335049","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Bluteau J, Coquillart S, Payan Y, Gentaz E.
