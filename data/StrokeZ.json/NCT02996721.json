Epidemiologic studies have associated low 25\\[OH\\] Vit D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, randomized trials are needed to establish the relevance of 25\\[OH\\] Vit D status to cardiovascular health. While a few randomized trials have evaluated vitamin D supplementation, none have \"treated to target\" (i.e., individual dosing so that adequate 25\\[OH\\] Vit D levels are obtained), but have rather given \"blanket\" doses regardless of 25\\[OH\\] Vit D level."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Death","Myocardial Infarction","Cerebral Vascular Accident","Heart Failure Hospitalization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":890,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients randomized to the standard of care arm will have a 25\\[OH\\] Vit D test performed, a sample taken and stored for future tests, and completion of a PHQ-9 depression survey at baseline and at study conclusion.
