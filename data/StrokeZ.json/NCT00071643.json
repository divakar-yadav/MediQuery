Evidence suggests that antidepressants may be used to prevent post-stroke depression. This study will treat nondepressed stroke patients with antidepressants or problem solving therapy (PST) to determine the most effective treatments for preventing depression.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive PST, escitalopram, or placebo (an inactive pill) for 12 months. Participants who display depressive symptoms for 2 weeks or more will be removed from the study. After 12 months, treatment will be discontinued and participants will be monitored for an additional 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":201,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1 Problem Solving Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive problem solving therapy.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Problem Solving Therapy"]},{"label":"2.
