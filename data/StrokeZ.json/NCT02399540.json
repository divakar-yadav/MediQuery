Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols- in a polarity and site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. However, it is unknown how the motor cortex excitability changes that follow tDCS relate to the increase in motor learning and recovery potential. The currently upheld hypothesis is that motor learning needs to be synchronized in time with electrical stimulation (paired stimulation), but recent results from our lab suggest that tDCS also increases skill learning after stimulation has ended (unpaired stimulation). If this is true, tDCS has a much larger therapeutic window and is a more valuable clinical tool than currently believed. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects the increase in skill learning normally seen with tDCS when applied 24 hours before training. The outcome of this study can provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.\n\nObjective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS in chronic stroke patients on skill learning 24 hours later.\n\nStudy design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Chronic stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective of the study is to determine the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS on skill learning 24 hours later. As a motor learning paradigm, the investigators will use a circuit tracking task which chronic stroke patients perform better if tDCS is applied concurrently. During this task, patients have to trace a cursor over a circuit as fast and accurately as possible by moving a computer mouse. Skill will be quantified by calculating a combined speed/ accuracy score and skill improvement compared to baseline (LI; the learning index) will be compared between the sham, conventional unpaired tDCS, conventional paired tDCS groups and the late LTP-like plasticity tDCS groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sham","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Day 1: sham stimulation Day 2: sham stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: Sham"]},{"label":"Conventional Paired tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Day 1: sham stimulation Day 2: conventional tDCS","interventionNames":["Device: Conventional Paired tDCS"]},{"label":"Conventional Unpaired tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Day 1: conventional tDCS Day 2: sham stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: Conventional Unpaired tDCS"]},{"label":"Late LTP-like Plasticity tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Day 1: late LTP-like Plasticity tDCS Day 2: sham stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: Late LTP-like Plasticity tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham","description":"Bihemispheric 1mA Sham protocol: sham - pause - sham","armGroupLabels":["Sham"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Conventional Paired tDCS","description":"Bihemispheric 1mA Sham protocol: sham - pause - sham Conventional Paired tDCS protocol: 20 minutes tDCS - pause - sham","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Paired tDCS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Conventional Unpaired tDCS","description":"Bihemispheric 1mA Sham protocol: sham - pause - sham Conventional Unpaired tDCS protocol: 20 minutes tDCS - pause - sham","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Unpaired tDCS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Late LTP-like Plasticity tDCS","description":"Bihemispheric 1mA Sham protocol: sham - pause - sham Late LTP-like Plasticity tDCS protocol: 10 minutes tDCS - 25 minutes pause - 10 minutes tDCS","armGroupLabels":["Late LTP-like Plasticity tDCS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Skill Retention","description":"Motor skill retention will be assessed on the circuit game","timeFrame":"Day 9"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximum Grip Force","description":"Maximum Grip Force will be assessed using a Jamar Dynamometer","timeFrame":"Day 1 and Day 9"},{"measure":"Purdue Pegboard Test","timeFrame":"Day 1 and Day 9"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Chronic (\\> 6 months) stroke patient\n* Aged 18-79 years\n* Motor deficit in the upper limb due to the stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Absence of recordable MEPs from the ADM after TMS\n* Absence of voluntary movement (Fugl-Meyer \\< III)\n* Head injury or the presence of intracranial metal or intracranial lesions\n* History of cranial irradiation\n* History of epilepsy\n* Presence of a pacemaker\n* Taking anticonvulsant or neuroleptic medication\n* Substance abuse\n* Inability to understand instructions\n* History of psychiatric disorders","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"79 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Rijndam","city":"Rotterdam","state":"Zuid-Holland","zip":"3015LJ","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.9225,"lon":4.47917}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23316151","type":"RESULT","citation":"Lefebvre S, Laloux P, Peeters A, Desfontaines P, Jamart J, Vandermeeren Y.
