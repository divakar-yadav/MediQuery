Most studies have recently demonstrated correlation between the variations in spatiotemporal gait parameters and fall risk in elderly and in several diseases. The investigators objective is to analyse this parameters in population with gait stability disorders (post-stroke patients and fallers) to identify the most valuable and to develop/test a conglomerate stability score.","detailedDescription":"Temporal-spatial gait parameters will be recorded in subjects aged 65-80 years : 30 healthy people, 30 patients at least one year post-stroke, and 30 fallers while walking on an electronic walkway GAITRite® at self-selected speed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy","Thalamic Pain Syndrome","Fallers"],"keywords":["Gait stability","Spatiotemporal parameters","Walking","Elderly people","Stroke","Fallers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"post-stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients who had only one cerebrovascular accident, at least one year before inclusion and Able to walk without using assisting devices or ambulatory aids","interventionNames":["Other: Gait analysis"]},{"label":"healthy subjects","description":"Aged 65 to 80 years","interventionNames":["Other: Gait analysis"]},{"label":"fallers","description":"Reported 2 or more falls within 6 months prior to the beginning of the study and Able to walk without using assisting devices or ambulatory aids","interventionNames":["Other: Gait analysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Gait analysis","description":"walking on an electronic walkway GAITRite® at self-selected speed","armGroupLabels":["fallers","healthy subjects","post-stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"GAIT parameters","description":"Spatiotemporal gait parameters registered by a GAITRite walkway system, including mean and coefficient of variation for step and cycle length and time, base of support, speed, cadence, single and double support phase, stance and swing phase.","timeFrame":"at inclusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Performance Score","description":"a score which represents a quantification of patients' gait based on a selection of spatiotemporal parameters obtained at a self-selected speed.","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Rivermead Motricity Index","description":"For post-stroke patients","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"For post-stroke patients","timeFrame":"at inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"1.
