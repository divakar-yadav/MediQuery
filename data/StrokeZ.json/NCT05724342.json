Several randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrated the noninferiority of TNK but the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of TNK in the real-world is insufficient.\n\nThis is a multi-center, prospective, registry cohort study that enrolled acute ischemic stroke patients treated with TNK thrombolysis in China."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["thrombolysis","tenecteplase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"serum sample"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rhTNK-tPA Thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Drug: rhTNK-tPA Thrombolysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"rhTNK-tPA Thrombolysis","description":"rhTNK-tPA Thrombolysis","armGroupLabels":["rhTNK-tPA Thrombolysis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Excellent functional outcome at 90 days","description":"proportion of mRS score 0-1 at 3 months.
