Moreover, this effectiveness-implementation trial will test the effectiveness of a lower BP target (\\<130/80 mmHg) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause dementia. Specifically, we will test the effectiveness of a village doctor-led multifaceted intervention, compared with usual care, on BP control, CVD, and dementia among rural residents with hypertension in China. This cluster randomized trial is conducted in 326 villages from three provinces in mainland China. A total of 163 villages was randomly assigned to a village doctor-led multifaceted intervention and 163 villages to usual care, stratified by provinces, counties, and townships. A total of 33,995 individuals aged ≥40 years with uncontrolled hypertension were recruited into the study. The village doctor-led multifaceted intervention is designed to overcome barriers at the healthcare system, provider, patient, and community levels. Study participants are followed every 6 months for BP, CVD, and other study outcomes. The primary outcome is BP control (\\<130/80 mm Hg) at 18 months in phase 1, CVD events over 36 months in phase 2, and all-cause dementia at 48 months in phase 3."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension"],"keywords":["Hypertension","Cardiovascular disease","Dementia","China","Protocol-based treatment","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome Assessment Committee members will be blinded to outcome assignment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33995,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Village-doctor-led multifaceted intervention","interventionNames":["Other: Village-doctor-led multifaceted intervention"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Village doctors in usual care group will not receive hypertension management training or support.
