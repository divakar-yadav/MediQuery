To increase the effectiveness of gait rehabilitation, it is critical to develop therapies that are based on an understanding of brain adaptations that occur after stroke. This project will be the first step towards the development of a novel therapeutic approach using brain stimulation to increase walking capacity in stroke survivors and understand the neural mechanisms that are associated with impairment and functional recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait","Brain stimulation","tDCS","Walking"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS+AMT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TDCS in combination with movement training before treadmill training","interventionNames":["Other: tDCS","Other: AMT","Behavioral: Treadmill training"]},{"label":"tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"tDCS only before treadmill training","interventionNames":["Other: tDCS","Behavioral: Treadmill training"]},{"label":"AMT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Movement training only before treadmill training","interventionNames":["Other: AMT","Behavioral: Treadmill training"]},{"label":"Control","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"No priming before treadmill training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Treadmill training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"tDCS","description":"1 mA of tDCS","armGroupLabels":["tDCS","tDCS+AMT"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"AMT","description":"Ankle motor training","armGroupLabels":["AMT","tDCS+AMT"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Treadmill training","description":"High intensity treadmill training","armGroupLabels":["AMT","Control","tDCS","tDCS+AMT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in gait speed using 10 meter walk test","description":"10-meter walk test: Gait speed will be measured as the average of 3 trials of the 10-m walk test.
