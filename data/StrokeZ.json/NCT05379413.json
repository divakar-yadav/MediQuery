Post-stroke spasticity (PSS) is outbreak after a stroke and is featured by disabling muscle stiffness. PSS could manifest in up tp 50% cases within 6 months after a stroke, especially in the upper limb. Despite it is an acknowledged condition it is insufficiently recognized and treated in clinical practice.\n\nFocal and regional spasticity could improve with rehabilitation and in selected cases with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) type A injections. The latter causes muscle relaxation and fosters neuroplasticity, which is able in turn of ameliorating several patient functional aspects. Recent literature demonstrated that PSS patients treated with early BoNT (within 3 month since PSS outbreak) could improve in their clinical status better than patients with a later treatment.\n\nAn earlier recognition of PSS predictors could improve patient management. Hence, the investigators are going to perform a multicentric prospective observational real life study with BoNT, based on the best clinical practice and aimed at the early recognition and management of PSS through the identification of 1) early clinical predictors of spasticity (collected within 10 days since stroke), 2) BoNT clinical outcome relative to the timing of the treatment"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke"],"keywords":["Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A)","Stroke","Rehabilitation","Post-Stroke Spasticity (PSS)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":960,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early BoNT treatment","description":"Patients with PSS treated with BoNT within the first Quartile of injection timing distribution","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin type A"]},{"label":"Late BoNT treatment","description":"Patients with PSS treated with BoNT within the third Quartile of injection timing distribution","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin type A"]},{"label":"Not treated with BoNT","description":"Natural controls with PSS not treated with BoNT"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum toxin type A","description":"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) Type A injection with either OnaBoNT-A, AboBoNT-A, IncoBoNT-A","armGroupLabels":["Early BoNT treatment","Late BoNT treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper limb post stroke-spasticity development","description":"Detection of a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) \\>/= 1 at the upper limb (MAS is a 0 to 5 score, with score 5 as the worst rigidity possible)","timeFrame":"0-24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Post-Stroke Spasticity in early vs late treatment","description":"Comparison of the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) at the elbow and wrist (MAS is a 0 to 5 score, with score 5 as the worst rigidity possible) in early versus late treatment","timeFrame":"3-24 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper limb functionality","description":"Comparison of functional items of upper limb functionality (arm activity measure scale, i.e. ARM-A a 0-84 scale - a higher score means a worse upper limb function) of early versus late treatments","timeFrame":"3-24 months"},{"measure":"Quality of Life measurement","description":"Comparison of Quality of Life (EuroQoL-5D or EQ-5D scale , 5 to 25 scale where 25 is the worst quality of life possible) of patients with early versus late treatments","timeFrame":"3-24 months"},{"measure":"Pain measurement","description":"Comparison of pain (Visual Analogue scale or VAS in units on a 0-10 grading system, where 10 is the worst pain possible) of patients with early versus late treatments","timeFrame":"3-24 months"},{"measure":"Spasticity in Botulinum Toxin (BoNT) treated versus untreated patients","description":"Comparison of modified ashworth scale (MAS) in BoNT treated versus untreated subjects (MAS is a 0 to 5 score, where 5 is the worst rigidity possible).
