Both groups received conventional swallowing rehabilitation, and in addition, the rTMS group received 5hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the healthy side. Swallowing function was assessed at admission and after two weeks of treatment using the the Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA), the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), the Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale(FEDSS), the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), and the functional near-infrared spectroscopic(fNIRS).","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and dysphagia is one of the common complications of stroke.Dysphagia after stroke can lead to serious complications such as aspiration, pneumonia, and malnutrition, which greatly reduces the quality of life of patients.Transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS), a non-invasive central nervous system stimulation that is safe, non-invasive, and does not require active patient participation, has been gradually applied to stroke rehabilitation in recent years.Although there have been studies on the improvement of post stroke dysphagia(PSD) by healthy-side high-frequency rTMS, there have been no studies assessing the activation of relevant brain regions before and after its treatment by fNIRS and exploring the possible mechanisms involved. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of high-frequency rTMS stimulation of the healthy mandibular hyoid cortical area at 5 hz on PSD, and to explore the possible mechanisms by assessing it with fNIRS, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical use of rTMS in the treatment of patients with PSD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Deglutition Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomization was performed by a staff member of our hospital, who was not involved in the implementation or evaluation of the trial, and who randomly assigned subjects to either the rTMS group or the sham rTMS group in a 1:1 ratio through the use of an electronic random sequence generator.
