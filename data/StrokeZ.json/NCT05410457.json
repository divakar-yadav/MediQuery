To study which variable or variables (various clinical biological indicators) affect the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients;\n2. To study the differences in variables (various clinical evaluations, biological indicators, etc.) among patients receiving different treatment strategies (including thrombolysis group, thrombectomy group, stent group, chronic occlusion reperfusion group and regular treatment group);\n3. To study hemoglobin, mean erythrocyte volume, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ, TNFα, C-reactive protein, serum iron and iron-related proteins (ferritin, transferrin, fibromodulin, ceruloplasmin), uric acid, amino acid, lipoprotein, homocysteine, vitamin D and other clinical indicators that correlated with acute ischemic stroke patients and different treatment groups were compared;\n4. To study the relationship between blood pressure changes at multiple time points from admission to discharge and clinical manifestations and prognosis of stroke patients, and to make comparison between groups;\n5. To study the relationship between ischemic stroke and other variables (clinical assessment, biological, genetic and neuroimaging) in different pathological types;\n6. To study the correlation between neuroimaging indicators and clinical evaluation, biomolecular, genetic and other variables;\n7. DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood samples of patients with acute stroke for genetic related studies to explore the genetic susceptibility of young stroke and unexplained stroke;\n8. To study the role of one-stop multimodal-MRI in the assessment and diagnosis of patients with acute ischemic stroke;\n9. To study the adverse reactions (hemorrhage, embolus shedding, gastrointestinal ulcer) and stroke-related complications under different treatment strategies (including thrombolysis group, thrombectomy group, stent group, chronic occlusion reperfusion group and regular treatment group);\n10. To study the effect of Sanbexin® (Edaravone and Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for Injection) on inflammation and the prognosis in ischemic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","clincial indicators","thrombolysis","thrombectomy","neuroimaging","genetics","one-stop multimodal-MRI","stroke related complications"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood samples were collected from routine blood sample."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"thrombolysis group","description":"Inclusion criteria: a) age ≥18 years;
