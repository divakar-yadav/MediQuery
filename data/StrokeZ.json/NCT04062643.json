In this study it has been sought whether baseline obesity is associated with recurrent stroke and major cardiovascular events in a long-time period.","detailedDescription":"Five-years follow-up data of Ege Stroke Registry for stroke recurrence and cardiovascular events regarding to obesity were analyzed. Data include age, gender, stroke severity, neuroimaging studies, cardiovascular risk factors. Within the inclusion period, all of the included patients were followed until censoring (10th of December 2011) or readmission because of recurrent stroke, cardiovascular event or death, whichever came first. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard model was applied to identify predictors of recurrent vascular events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["obesity","recurrent stroke","ischemic stroke","hemorrhagic stroke","cardiovascular events","vascular death"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9285,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with obesity","description":"Obesity in those with BMI â‰¥30 kg/m2","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Obesity assessment"]},{"label":"Patients without obesity","description":"Normal weight was considered in the patients with BMI \\<30 kg/m2","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Obesity assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Obesity assessment","description":"Body mass index (BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from measurements of weight to the nearest kg and height","armGroupLabels":["Patients with obesity","Patients without obesity"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke recurrence","description":"Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All consecutive stroke patients.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Incomplete baseline information, other factors making them unsuitable for follow-up,undetermined stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All stroke patients enrolled in the prospective cohort registry in Egeanregion.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"If the publisher will accept to share IPD, we can give permission to share IPD."}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000009765","term":"Obesity"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000050177","term":"Overweight"},{"id":"D000044343","term":"Overnutrition"},{"id":"D000009748","term":"Nutrition Disorders"},{"id":"D000001835","term":"Body Weight"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M12391","name":"Obesity","asFound":"Obesity","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6535","name":"Death","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14540","name":"Recurrence","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2405","name":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25876","name":"Overweight","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M24997","name":"Overnutrition","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12374","name":"Nutrition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4804","name":"Body Weight","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
