However, while a rapidly-growing number of stroke centers become capable of performing EVT, the general quality of EVT remains unsatisfied, resulting in a considerable proportion of patients who could not reach functional independence. Our pre-established artificial intelligence (AI)-aided clinical feedback system could dynamically record and report key timepoints of EVT in-hospital process. Combined with multi-aspect intervention via remote/on-site surveillance and education, this may be a potential solution for quality improvement of EVT. Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate whether an AI-aided clinical feedback system coupled with multi-aspect intervention could improve the quality of EVT. Twenty hospitals with annual EVT cases \\> 30 will be 1:1 randomized into intervention group and control group. The intervention group will receive AI-based clinical feedback system coupled with multi-aspect intervention, including remote/on-site surveillance and education regarding in-hospital workflow and surgical procedures of EVT. The control group only deploys AI-aided clinical feedback system. The primary outcome is the ratio of good functional outcome (mRS \\> 2) at 3 month."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1221,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"AI-aided clinical feedback system coupled with multi-aspect intervention based on the Behaviour Change Wheel model","interventionNames":["Behavioral: AI-aided clinical feedback system coupled with multi-aspect intervention basd on Behaviour Change Wheel model"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"AI-aided clinical feedback system only"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"AI-aided clinical feedback system coupled with multi-aspect intervention basd on Behaviour Change Wheel model","description":"Interventions are developed on a psychological model, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) .The fundamental of BCW consists of three essential elements: capability, motivation, and opportunity.
