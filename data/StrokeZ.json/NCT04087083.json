The incidence of stroke rapidly increases with age, doubling for each decade after age 55 years. Gait impairment is one of the most important problems after stroke and improve walking function is often a key component of any rehabilitation program. To achieve this goal, robotic gait trainer seems to be promising. In fact, some studies underline the efficacy of robotic gait training based on end-effector technology, for different diseases, in particular in stroke patients. In this randomized controlled trial, we verify the efficacy of the robotic treatment in terms of improving the gait and reducing the risk of falling and its long-term effects.\n\nIn this single blind randomized controlled trial the investigators will include 150 elderly subacute stroke patients divided in two groups to receive a traditional rehabilitation program or a robotic rehabilitation using G-EO system, an end-effector device for the gait rehabilitation, in addition to the traditional therapy. A 20 treatment sessions will be conducted, divided into 3 training sessions per week, for 7 weeks. The control group will perform traditional therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes. The technological intervention group, using G-EO system, will carry out 30 minutes of traditional therapy and 20 minutes of treatment with a robotic system. The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the falling risk. Secondary outcomes are the assessment of the gait improvements and the fear of falling. Further evaluations, such as length and asymmetry of the step, walking and functional status, acceptance of the technology, will be carried."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aging Problems","Innovative Rehabilitation Treatment Based on Robotics"],"keywords":["stroke","robotic rehabilitation","frail elderly","gait performance","balance","risk of falling","quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"technological intervention arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Twenty technological treatment sessions divided into 3 training sessions per week for 7 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Technological intervention arm"]},{"label":"Control arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Twenty traditional treatment sessions divided into 3 training sessions per week for 7 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Control arm"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Technological intervention arm","description":"Each session will include 30 minutes of traditional physical rehabilitation therapy followed by 20 minutes of robotic training (G-EO system, Reha Technology, Switzerland), an end-effector technology that simulates floor walking and stairs climbing (up and down)","armGroupLabels":["technological intervention arm"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control arm","description":"Each session will include 50 minutes of traditional physical rehabilitation therapy","armGroupLabels":["Control arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"difference in falling risk between experimental arm and control arm","description":"falling risk will be evaluated by the Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA).
