A full etiological work up within a short time is critical to implement the appropriate preventive treatment. The etiological work up is actually based on a clinical examination and on a group of paraclinical examinations. The realization of the standard strategy is time consuming, and increase the cost of the medical care. A non-invasive one-shot examination of the heart, the aorta and the cervical and intracranial arteries (cci-MRI) could overcome these disadvantages.The investigator therefore propose to carry out an overall assessment of the performance of the cci-MR in the etiological work up of ischemic strokes and TIAs compared to the reference strategy"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":244,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Reference strategy","type":"OTHER","description":"correspond to the reference techniques according to the current guidelines in the etiological work up of ischemic strokes and TIA","interventionNames":["Other: Current guidelines"]},{"label":"Evaluated strategy","type":"OTHER","description":"correspond to perform the cci-MR: cardiac MRI with late-enhancement, angio-MRI of the cervical and intracranial arteries","interventionNames":["Other: cc-MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Current guidelines","description":"doppler ultrasound and/or angio CT-scan of the cervical arteries, angio CT-scan of the intracranial arteries, TTE wich can be supplemented by a TEE at the discretion of the investigator.
