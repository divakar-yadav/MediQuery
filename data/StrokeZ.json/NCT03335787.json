In stroke patients, the mortality rate is approximately 30%, and there is an increase in the morbidity rate after stroke occurrence. In addition, stroke is one of the main factors in increases in the burden of health care expenses during adulthood (3).\n\nThere is a constant requirement for specific data about stroke rehabilitation methods for achieving evidence-based rehabilitation guidelines.To investigate the effects of repeated correction taping applied on the ankle and peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles on balance and gait in patients with stroke. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the long term effect of KT applied on ankle and peroneal muscle on both dynamic and static balance in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Athletic Tape","Proprioception","Hemiplegia","Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients' information and contact will be obtained from neurologist and willing participant's gender, age and stroke onset data will be processed with a random number generator in order to form groups.

TUG was used to assess balance, mobility and walking ability of the patients before and after the procedure as a part of the BESTest. However, as a strong indicator of functional mobility we decided to analyze TUG results separately from the overall BESTest outcomes. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.","timeFrame":"two weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional reach test (FRT)-Change from Baseline","description":"FRT was used to assess the limits of stability by measuring the distance that a patient can reach forward without losing balance. The test was performed while patient standing on both feet next to a wall. A measurement tape fixed to the wall on the level of patients' acromion. Cut of score was taken as 25 cm. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.","timeFrame":"two weeks"},{"measure":"Tetrax balance systems-Change from Baseline","description":"Tetrax balance system which focuses measuring static balance and postural sways with integrated 4 force plates for tracking weight difference on forefoot and hindfoot. Primary principal of this device is to measure the center of mass and postural sways by using 4 force plates. Assessment was performed while patients standing on the force plates eyes facing forward and without touching anything with their hands. Normal values were taken as 1.0 standard deviation below and 1.5 standard deviation above the mean scores. Higher result related to somato-sensory dysfunction. For weight distribution index it is expected to %25 of total body weight recorded on each plate. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.","timeFrame":"two weeks"},{"measure":"Functional Independence Measure (FIM)-Change from Baseline","description":"Index for measuring both motor and cognitive independency level of patients under total 18 questions.
