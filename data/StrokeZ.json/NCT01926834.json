The main indexes are the serum level of VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC.The review is made by the reference to NIHSS and so on. So, Erigeron Injection have the function of promoting angiogenesis in multiple targets through this test.","detailedDescription":"OBJECTIVE:\n\nTo study the effects of Erigeron Injection on human serum VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC levels after acute cerebral infarction.\n\nMETHOD:\n\n40 patients with acute cerebral infarction(in accordance with the inclusion criteria) were divided randomly into erigeron injection+aspirin group,aspirin group,and 20 health people. Erigeron injection+aspirin group and aspirin group drew peripheral blood on the prior treatment,the posttreatment 1th, 3th and 7th day,and tested the level of VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC.Tested the health people one time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["promoting angiogenesis in multiple targets","herbal medicine","traditional chinese medicine","random clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erigeron Injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Erigeron Injection, 30ml,qd,i.v., for 7 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Erigeron Injection"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"normal saline, 500ml,i.v.,qd, for 7 days","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"health volunteers","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"health volunteers, no drug to be given."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erigeron Injection","description":"Erigeron Injection, 30ml, iv, qd, for 7days","armGroupLabels":["Erigeron Injection"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"normal saline, 500ml,i.v.,qd, for 7 days","armGroupLabels":["placebo"],"otherNames":["normal saline, 500ml,i.v.,qd, for 7 days"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the serum level of VEGF,MMP-9 and EPC","timeFrame":"0-7days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institute of Health of stroke scale","timeFrame":"0-7days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients aged no younger than 18yrs\n* attack within 72 hours\n* NIHSS score in the 2-25 points\n* Ischemic Stroke occurred for the first time, or with a history of stroke disease but without sequelae\n* Signed the informed consents\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients aged younger than 18yrs\n* Patients with tumor, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, psoriasis, rheumatism, hematologic diseases, infertility, varieties of acute inflammation\n* Patients with severe cognitive impairment\n* Refused to cooperate or been unable to cooperation for neurological disorders\n* Cerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhagic cerebral infarction\n* Unstable vital signs dued to massive cerebral infarction\n* Patients with serious heart, liver and renal insufficiency","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jianwen Guo, doctor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0086-13724899379","email":"jianwen_guo@msn.com"},{"name":"Yefeng Cai, master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(08620)81887233","phoneExt":"34530","email":"caiyefeng@126.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jianwen m Guo, doctor","affiliation":"Guangdong Province Hospital of Tradtional Chinese Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
