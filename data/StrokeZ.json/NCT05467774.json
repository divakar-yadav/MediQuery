The investigators found that operant conditioning of rectus femoris reflex excitability was feasible in all participants.","detailedDescription":"The investigators performed a cohort study on 7 individuals (5 healthy, 2 post-stroke) to examine the feasibility of operant down-conditioning of rectus femoris reflex excitability (i.e. H-reflex). Each individual performed 30 sessions, 6 baseline sessions with no operant conditioning (225 trials of surface electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve), followed by 24 training sessions (20 baseline trials followed by 225 trials with feedback of H-reflex magnitude). The investigators' main outcome measure was rectus femoris H-reflex magnitude. We also examined H-reflex magnitude of other quadriceps muscles."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive 24 sessions of operant H-reflex conditioning of the rectus femoris.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Operant RF H-reflex conditioning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Operant RF H-reflex conditioning","description":"Operant down-conditioning of rectus femoris H-reflex","armGroupLabels":["Training group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RF H-reflex magnitude","description":"H-reflex magnitude of rectus femoris","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"VM H-reflex magnitude","description":"H-reflex magnitude of vastus medialis","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Premorbidly independent\n* Mild to moderate impairment determined by standard practices per the physical therapist\n* Ability to stand for 10-minute intervals unassisted\n* Ability to walk for 10-minutes on a treadmill\n* Reduced knee flexion during phase and SKG as determined by a clinician\n* Hemiparesis\n* Ability to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of cerebellar stroke, multiple stroke\n* History of serious lower limb musculoskeletal injury\n* Functionally relevant osteoarthritis and weight-bearing restrictions\n* Have condition related to claustrophobia or other MRI contraindications\n* Functionally relevant cognitive impairment\n* Functionally relevant vision impairment\n* Took antispasmodic medication one day prior to the session\n* Had Botox injection one week prior to the session\n* Pregnant women","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of Texas at Austin","city":"Austin","state":"Texas","zip":"78712","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":30.26715,"lon":-97.74306}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"Unidentified data available upon reasonable request","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL","SAP","ANALYTIC_CODE"],"timeFrame":"3 years"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14","submissionTracking":{"estimatedResultsFirstSubmitDate":"2024-02-13","submissionInfos":[{"releaseDate":"2024-02-13"}]}},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
