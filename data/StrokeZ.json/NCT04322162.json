While obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known risk factor for stroke and TIA that is present in more than 70% of stroke/TIA survivors, testing for OSA is infrequently performed for patients and within healthcare systems. The Addressing Sleep Apnea Post-Stroke/TIA (ASAP) study intends to improve rates of guideline-recommended OSA testing and treatment through local quality improvement initiatives (QI) conducted within and across 6 VA Medical Centers. ASAP will also determine the impact of these local QI initiatives on rates of OSA diagnosis, OSA treatment, recurrent vascular events, and hospital readmissions.","detailedDescription":"Approximately 11,000 Veterans present to a VAMC annually with an acute ischemic stroke or TIA. The cornerstone of secondary stroke/TIA prevention includes delivering timely, guideline-concordant vascular risk factor management. Over the past decade, OSA has been recognized as a potent, underdiagnosed, and inadequately treated cerebrovascular risk factor. OSA is very common among patients with stroke/TIA with a prevalence of 60-80%. Despite being highly prevalent, 70-80% of patients with OSA are neither diagnosed nor treated. Untreated OSA has been associated with poor outcomes among patients with cerebrovascular disease including higher mortality and worse functional status. The mainstay of OSA therapy is positive airway pressure (PAP). PAP reduces recurrent vascular events, improves neurological symptoms and functional status among stroke/TIA patients with OSA. The evidence favoring neurological recovery is strongest when interventions are applied early post-stroke/TIA. Guidelines recommend diagnosing and treating OSA for stroke and TIA patients; however, within VHA, very few stroke or TIA patients receive OSA screening. This guideline recommendation was informed in part by clinical trials utilizing an acute OSA assessment protocol developed and implemented by the investigators' group. To address the observed gap in care, the investigators propose a Hybrid Type I, randomized, stepped-wedge trial at 6 VAMCs to increase the rate of timely, guideline-concordant diagnosis and treatment of OSA among Veterans with ischemic stroke/TIA and thereby reduce recurrent vascular events and hospital readmissions. The investigators will identify matched control sites for each ASAP implementation site to examine temporal trends in outcomes among non-intervention sites. For example, the investigators will use administrative data to examine the use of polysomnography across stroke/TIA patients in the VA system and compare changes in matched controls versus the intervention sites on the diagnostic rate. The same adjustment approach will be used for ASAP intervention sites and for control sites."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)","Obstructive Sleep Apnea"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Transient ischemic attack (TIA)","Stepped-wedge trial","Implementation Science","Hybrid Type I","Quality Improvement","Systems Redesign","Champion","External Facilitation","Audit and feedback","Local Adaptation","Obstructive Sleep Apnea","Polysomnography","Sustainability","Business-case"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active implementation - Wave 1 (First and Second Sites)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This four-year stepped-wedge evaluation includes a total of 6 sites.
