It has been suggested that repeated stimulation sessions are required to elicit long-lasting improvements. We aim to consider these details over the duration of this research, during which patients with chronic stroke will attend for 16 sessions over the course of 3 months.\n\nThis research has important implications; previous studies suggest that such an approach has the potential to facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke and establish tDCS as a clinically viable rehabilitative tool. Recovery of motor skills may take many months to acquire and therefore strategies that have the potential to enhance acquisition of skill are of practical and scientific interest."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases"],"keywords":["tDCS","Stroke","Functional MRI","Motor Learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal tDCS and Motor Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex of the ipsilesional hemisphere.
