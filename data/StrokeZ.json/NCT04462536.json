Because AIS (acute ischemic stroke) is a medical emergency, the trial is designed to enable the administration of standard-of-care treatments without delay in order to save the life of the person concerned, restore good health or alleviate suffering.\n\nParticipants harboring an acute ischemic stroke who are selected for endovascular revascularization without intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy will be given a single, 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous dose of nerinetide or placebo. Outcomes of the main trial will be evaluated throughout a 90 day observation period.\n\nParticipants will be followed at 1-Year for the analytic sub-trial for further outcome assessment by telemedicine or telephone interview conducted by individuals blinded to the outcome of the main trial. This sub-trial will be conducted to explore the independent functioning and quality of life at 1-Year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":850,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Vehicle only","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Nerinetide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single intravenous infusion of nerinetide 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) over 10 ± 1 minutes","interventionNames":["Drug: Nerinetide"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Vehicle only","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nerinetide","description":"Single intravenous infusion of nerinetide 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) over 10 ± 1 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Nerinetide"],"otherNames":["NA-1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with independent functioning on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), as defined by a score of 0-2","description":"The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke.
