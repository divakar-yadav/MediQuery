Some of these reported CAA patients with cerebral microbleeds also had chronic lobar intracerebral haemorrhage. Few data is available on IVT-treated CAA patients showing cortical superficial siderosis. There are no reports studying factors associated with brain hemorrhagic complication or functional outcome inside a group of IVT-treated CAA patients. Our aim was to evaluate brain hemorrhagic complications on 24h-CT and functional outcome after IVT in stroke patients with CAA features on pre-IVT MRI.\n\nMethods: In our stroke center, IVT decision in patients with CAA MRI features is left at the discretion of the treating physician. We retrospectively screened pre-IVT imaging of 959 consecutive IVT-treated stroke patients (between January 2015 and July 2022) without ongoing anticoagulation therapy for probable CAA MRI features defined by modified Boston criteria. After exclusion of 119 patients with lacking MRI (n=47), with MRI showing motion artefacts (n=49) or with alternative chronic brain hemorrhage cause on MRI (n=23), 15 IVT-treated patients with probable CAA on pre-IVT MRI were identified. In these 15 patients, clinical, biological and MRI characteristics were compared between patients with vs. without post-IVT hemorrhage and between patients with poor (MRS 3-6) vs. good (MRS 0-2) functional outcome at discharge."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhage","Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy","Stroke"],"keywords":["functional outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)","description":"Patients with CAA treated with intravenous thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Other: None, pure observational study"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"None, pure observational study","description":"None, pure observational study","armGroupLabels":["cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"brain hemorrhage","description":"brain hemorrhage on non-enhanced CT at 24 hours after IVT (Yes/No)","timeFrame":"24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)"},{"measure":"functional outcome","description":"functional outcome at hospital discharge according to the modified Rankin scale (Poor/Good)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months.
