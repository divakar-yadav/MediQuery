The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Segmental muscle vibration (SMV) application along with supervised physical therapy (SPT) on improving activities of daily living (ADL) and motor recovery on the hemiparetic upper extremity in patients with stroke.\n\nMethods: A sample of 37 patients post stroke (29 males) was randomly assigned to either supervised physical therapy (SPT) control group (n=18) or supervised physical therapy and segmental muscle vibration (SPT-SMV) experimental group (n=19). All patients received 3 sessions per week of SPT for 8 weeks. The SPT-SMV experimental group received SMV at the end of each SPT session. Outcome measures used were Barthel Index (BI), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), and goniometry for Range of Motion (ROM) assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"physical therapy intervention and segmental muscle vibration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"physiotherapy intervention and segmental muscle vibration device","interventionNames":["Device: segmental vibration device","Other: physical therapy exercises"]},{"label":"physical therapy intervention","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"physical therapy intervention alone","interventionNames":["Other: physical therapy exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"segmental vibration device","description":"segmental vibration device","armGroupLabels":["physical therapy intervention and segmental muscle vibration"],"otherNames":["physical therapy intervention"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"physical therapy exercises","armGroupLabels":["physical therapy intervention","physical therapy intervention and segmental muscle vibration"],"otherNames":["manual resistance exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"goniometry","description":"Range of motion assessed by goniometry; is the measurement of angles, particularly those formed by joints.

Measure of functional disability. The BI consisting of 10 common activities of daily living (ADL) activities, administered through direct observation. These are assessed for independence/ dependence and scored via an arbitrary weighting system (originally applied to reflect nursing care and social acceptability). Eight of the ten items represent activities related to personal care; the remaining 2 are related to mobility.
