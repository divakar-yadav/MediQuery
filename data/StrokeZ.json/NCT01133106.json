In the earlier trial we demonstrated that a pleasant event/problem-solving brief psychosocial-behavioral therapy delivered by psychosocial nurse practitioners was highly effective in treating major depression and promoting remission in ischemic stroke survivors for up to two years. In this phase, we refine the protocol, and potentially make it more cost effective, by conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of in-person versus telephone delivery of the intervention, comparing with usual care control. We also seek to expand our sample to include hemorrhagic stroke survivors (intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) as well as those with ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke","Depression"],"keywords":["stroke recovery","quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"In-person behavioral intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"behavioral counseling plus antidepressant treatment prescribed by participant's own provider; consisted of orientation session plus 6 counseling sessions in person with a psychosocial nurse practitioner","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Brief pleasurable events/behavioral therapy"]},{"label":"Telephone behavioral intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This arm is identical to the in-person Arm except that the intervention is delivered by telephone instead of in-person.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Brief pleasurable events/behavioral therapy"]},{"label":"Standard care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"participants have orientation to the study with the same written materials given those in the experimental arms.
