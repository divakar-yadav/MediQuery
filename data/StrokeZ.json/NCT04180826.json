Ischemic strokes are caused by the occlusion of an intracranial artery by a thrombus, responsible for tissue ischemia related to a decrease in local cerebral blood flow (CBS). Thus, the management of patients with Ischemic strokes is based on the preservation of an area that maintains sufficient intracranial hemodynamics (IH) and achieves the fastest possible recanalization. The impact of the patient's position (supine or seated position) on the IH in the event of narrowing or occlusion of an artery is poorly assessed but may be of particular importance. In practice, variations in blood flow according to the positioning of the patient's body can be measured using a transcranial Doppler. It is a simple, non-invasive and painless examination that provides the patient's bed with data on the intracerebral hemodynamic profile of patients.\n\nThis study was implemented because there are no studies known to us that evaluate the effect of verticalization on intracerebral hemodynamics based on the presence of upstream arterial stenosis or occlusion and other multimodal evaluation data in transcranial Doppler."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Carotid Stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stenosis","description":"Patients with stenosis","interventionNames":["Other: Observational"]},{"label":"No stenosis","description":"Patients without stenosis","interventionNames":["Other: Observational"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Observational","description":"Initially, the patient will be placed in a strict supine position (at 0°) in his hospital bed, according to the usual care.\n\nIn a second step, the patient will be verticalized (from 0° to 90°).
