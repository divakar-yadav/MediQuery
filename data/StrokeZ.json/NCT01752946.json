Although some western countries product similar injections and use them, Shuxuening injection also regarded as Chinese medicine injection. As a TCM injection, the most important thing is how to safety use it in practice.\n\nIn order to improving monitoring adverse events or adverse drug reaction of Chinese medicine injection in hospital, registry study is suitable method in this area. Otherwise, nested case control study is used to find out the mechanism of allergic reaction.\n\nCalculate the incidence of adverse events or adverse drug reaction is one of the main aims for this study. Safety surveillance on Chinese Medicine injection is an important problem that needs to be sorted out through large sample observational study.\n\nAccording to the 'rule of three', 30,000 cases need to be registered at least. The aim population is who using Shuxuening injection's during inpatient time from December 2012 to December 2014.\n\nData will be collected for three departments as following:\n\nForm A (green): demographic information ；Form B (pink): adverse drug events/reaction； Form C (white): extracted information from hospital information system and laboratory information system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Disease","Intracranial Embolism","Stroke","Angina Pectoris","Vasospasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of Shuxuening injection's ADRs and factors contributed to the occurrence of the adverse reaction","description":"All participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks. Patients using Shuxuening will be registered on a registration form including disease background, Shuxuening's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. When the patients occurs allergic reaction during using Shuxuening injection, it also need to collect patient's biological samples. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side-effects of Shuxuening injection.","timeFrame":"to assess Shuxuening's \"adverse event\" and \"drug adverse reaction\" during patients' hospital stay, administration information of Shuxuening will be registered every day.
