The protocols have been developed at Columbia University to be child friendly and draws upon our experience since 1997 with constraint-induced movement therapy in children with cerebral palsy. The investigators will test the hypothesis that bimanual training (HABIT) will result in improved hand function in children with hemiplegia.","detailedDescription":"A new treatment involving bimanual (Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy (HABIT). The protocols have been developed at Columbia University to be child friendly and draws upon our experience since 1997 with constraint-induced movement therapy in children with cerebral palsy. The investigators developed HABIT in 2004 as an alternative to constraint-therapy that avoids use of a restraint. The interventions are performed in a 15 day day-camp setting with several children and at least one therapist per child. The investigators have conducted 24 day camps to date since 2002, and are now collaborating with clinicians worldwide to expand our treatment availability. The aim is to promote the use of and improve the coordination of movement of both hands together. PARTICIPATION IS FREE.
