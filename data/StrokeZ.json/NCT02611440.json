Nevertheless, it is suboptimal and the implementation of specific interventions are needed to improve it.\n\nA patient - centered and pluriprofessional structured intervention, targeting the medication, introduced at hospital discharge and continued at home (by regular telephone contact) could improve medication adherence one year after stroke.\n\nThis intervention would consist of semi structured interviews patient-pharmacist at different times during one year after stroke. The information about the therapeutic management of the patient will be shared between healthcare professionals : general practitioners (GP) and community pharmacists (CP), hospital clinical pharmacist (HCP) and physician (HPhys).\n\nIt will allow for decrease of the recurrent stroke and others cardiovascular complications based on a better adherence to preventive medication. Furthermore the decrease of the iatrogenic events and the improvement of the quality of life of patients may be also associated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","medication adherence","cardiovascular disease prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":182,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pharmacist Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"It will be a semi -structured interviews with patient and pharmacist over various time after the stroke (at Month0, M3, M6, M9) combined with patient's therapeutic follow-up from various healthcare professionals.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Pharmaceutical care"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No pharmacist intervention planned."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Pharmaceutical care","description":"Initial interview with pharmacist (at the hospital discharge): Evaluation aimed to identify barriers to adherence to drug treatment followed by an information session on the disease, the benefit of drugs and the importance of diet and lifestyle habits.
