Drug options for depression and accompanying sleep problems are limited; In addition, effective doses cannot be increased depending on the comorbidities of the patients and the side effect profiles and drug interactions of the drugs used. Acupuncture has been used in Chinese traditional medicine for more than 2000 years and there are findings that it has positive effects in post-stroke depression and anxiety disorders.\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness and reliability of acupuncture treatment in depression and anxiety disorders developing after stroke and to reduce the need for multiple drugs and / or high-dose medication in the treatment of these complications.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study: Acupuncture is an effective and reliable treatment method for depression and anxiety disorders in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Patients who receive inpatient stroke rehabilitation at Istanbul Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic, will be included in the study by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Their informed consent will be received. Initially, clinical and demographic data of all patients will be noted. Participants who volunteered for the study will be separated into the acupuncture treatment group and the control group by simple random sampling. Both the acupuncture treatment group and the control group will be included in the conventional rehabilitation program 2 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 8 weeks. In addition the acupuncture treatment group will get acupuncture treatment which will be applied to Baihui (DU20), Yintang (EX-HN3) points and bilateral Tai Chong (LR3), Hegu (LI4) points for 4 weeks, twice a week. During the application, the feeling of De Qi will be taken and the application will take 20 minutes. Measurements; Hamilton Depression Rating Scales, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scales, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Barthel Index, and change in psychiatric drug use will be assessed at baseline (week 0), 4th and 8th week post-treatment. The adverse events observed during the study will be noted and the compliance of patients in each application will be questioned by visual analog scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Depression","Anxiety Disorders"],"keywords":["stroke","acupuncture","depression","anxiety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Acupuncture Treatment Group: will get acupuncture treatment which will be applied to Baihui (DU20), Yintang (EX-HN3) points and bilateral Tai Chong (LR3), Hegu (LI4) points for 4 weeks, twice a week.
