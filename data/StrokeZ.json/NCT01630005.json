Some studies proved that depression is often an unrecognized complication from stroke, associated with a vital prognosis, functional and cognitive pejorative diagnosis. It led us to pose the hypothesis of the existence of a particular psychological state after stroke particularly favorable to a psychotherapeutic alliance. So, this longitudinal monocentric study aims to estimate the feasibility of a talk therapy and its impact on the anxio-depressive symptomatology after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Adams-Stokes Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Talk therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A cohort of 25 patients","interventionNames":["Behavioral: talk therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"talk therapy","description":"Psychotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Talk therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"acceptability","description":"Participation rate in the study","timeFrame":"at 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rates of anxiety and depression","description":"Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale(depressive patients) and wide COVI (anxious patients)","timeFrame":"at 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of quality of life","description":"MM20-QOL scale","timeFrame":"at 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of functional recovery","description":"* Barthel index and Rankin score\n* NIHSS score","timeFrame":"at 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Assessment of apathy","description":"apathy index","timeFrame":"at 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Categorization of patients","description":"according to their pattern of coping with specific scales and RWCQ (Revised Ways of Coping Questionnaire - stroke modified version) QSSP (Questionnaire de soutien social perçu)","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ischemic or aemoragic stroke minor 1 week, confirmed by cerebral imaging\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe aphasia (NIHSS criteria 9: sup or egal: 2)\n* Chronic psychiatric preexistant desease.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hélène MAHAGNE, PH","affiliation":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Nice","city":"Nice","zip":"06200","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70313,"lon":7.26608}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000000219","term":"Adams-Stokes Syndrome"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000006327","term":"Heart Block"},{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000075224","term":"Cardiac Conduction System Disease"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3264","name":"Adams-Stokes Syndrome","asFound":"Adams-Stokes Syndrome","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9105","name":"Heart Block","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M1472","name":"Cardiac Conduction System Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
