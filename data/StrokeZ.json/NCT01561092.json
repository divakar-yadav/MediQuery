We wish to conduct a prospective randomised double blind placebo-controlled multicenter study of the combined neuroprotective and antithrombotic effects of SSRI treatment after stroke. Deletion of the SERT (serotonin transporter) gene may influence this treatment effect and may in itself be a risk factor for stroke, an aspect we also wish to explore.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. SSRI treatment commenced in the acute phase of stroke (day 2-5) protects against new thromboembolic events and leads to better rehabilitation.\n2. A specific SERT genotype is associated with an increased risk of first ever stroke.\n3. A specific SERT genotype is associated with a higher risk of post stroke depression.\n\n600 stroke patients will be randomised to either escitalopram or placebo treatment in a 1:1 ratio and genotyped according to SERT polymorphisms. The treatment and follow up period is 6 months. During these 6 months there will be 2 clinical follow up visits, one telephone control and one visit to evaluate compliance regarding medication. Patients who had an MRI as a part of the routine investigations done upon admission (approximately 300 patients) will have a control MRI after 6 months.\n\nAdditionally 400 patients, not eligible for participation i the randomised controlled trial, will be genotyped and answer questionnaires after 1 and 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","RCT","SSRI","Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Escitalopram","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug:
