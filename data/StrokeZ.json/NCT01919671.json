We aim to enroll a total of 1968 individuals(984 cases in each group) with acute ischemic stroke less than 72 hours after onset. Participants will be randomized into Tongxinluo capsule treatment group with the capsule administration of 4 granules tid. for 90 days, while the patients in the control group receive placebo capsule. NIH Stroke Score of the subjects is 4-22 at randomization. Evaluations of efficacy and safety will be taken at baseline, 7 days, discharge date and 90 days. Neuroimaging \\[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\\] will be obtained at baseline and 90 days after therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤1 at 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Tongxinluo capsule"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2007,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tongxinluo capsule","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tongxinluo capsule,4 granules,t.i.d. po,for 90 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Tongxinluo capsule"]},{"label":"placebo capsule","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"placebo capsule,4 granules,t.i.d. po,for 90 days","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo capsule"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tongxinluo capsule","description":"for 90 days","armGroupLabels":["Tongxinluo capsule"],"otherNames":["Yiling Pharmaceutical，Z19980015"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo capsule","description":"for 90 days","armGroupLabels":["placebo capsule"],"otherNames":["placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) less than or equal to 1 at 90 days.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) reaching 0-1 or reduction 4 points .","timeFrame":"Baseline, 7days, discharge date, 90 days"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with Bathel Index（BI）score more than 85.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 7days, discharge date, 90 days"},{"measure":"Continuous changes of Modified Rankin Scale score.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 7days, discharge date, 90 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke/TIA/ new ischemic lesion in MRI Images.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of new combination clinical vascular events (ischemic stroke/ hemorrhagic stroke/ TIA/ MI/ vascular death).","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"MR indicated symptomatic or non-symptomatic cerebral infarction emerging","description":"Compared with baseline MRI, re-examination of MRI shows new infarct diagnosed by DWI or FLARI (including new infarct and enlargement of infarct size) in areas other than the original infarct in DWI and FLAIR-sequence.","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stoke within 72 after onset, confirmed by MRI or CT.\n* Age 35-75 years, inclusive.\n* Patients with the first attack or patients with stroke history(modified Rankin Scale score 0-1).\n* Clear signs of localization of nervous system, NIHSS score 4 to 22.\n* Patient or proxy has signed informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hemorrhage diseases according to head CT or MRI, such as hemorrhagic stroke, epidural hematoma, intracranial hematoma, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, haemorrhage after cerebral infarction.\n* Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA).\n* Severe disturbance of consciousness: 1a of NIHSS score\\>1 point;
