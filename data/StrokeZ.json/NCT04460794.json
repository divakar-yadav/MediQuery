A total of 40 stroke participants will be recruited from two acute public hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the interention and usual care, or usual care only. Data will be collected in multiple forms: recruitment/retention rates, adherence to the intervention, journals, field notes, verbal feedback, audio records, semi-structured interviews, and questionnaires on outcomes (balance, confidence in balance, gait, walking endurance). This study is the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Findings will address the cross-cultural applicability of dance interventions and lay the groundwork for examination in a larger-RCT about its effects on survivors' balance, gait and memory."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Unsteady","Balance; Distorted","Memory Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ballet-inspired workout programme (Group A)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will continue their usual activities and exercises, and in addition, receive an 8-week home-based programme delivered by trained volunteers via hybrid on-site and virtual contacts, and supported by volunteer healthcare professionals.
