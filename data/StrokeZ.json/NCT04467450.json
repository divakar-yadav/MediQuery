A common sequela of stroke is hemiplegic shoulder pain, which can hamper functional recovery and subsequently lead to disability. Hemiplegic shoulder pain can begin as early as 2 weeks post stroke but typically occurs within 2-3 months post stroke.","detailedDescription":"Subject and methods: Patients with clinical diagnosis of hemiparesis on the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2001) will be recruited from Benha university hospitals' outpatients and inpatients units of Rheumatology ,Rehabilitation and Physical medicine department The diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by the findings of either brain CT or MRI.\n\nAll patients should have localized severe shoulder pain of the paretic upper limb with or without limitation of shoulder range of motion (ROM) with the following inclusion criteria:\n\nHemiplegic shoulder pain (HSP) duration at least 3 months, pain score \\>3 on a pain visual analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 cm (0 no pain, 10 worst possible pain) at rest, and/or pain at movement score \\>5 on VAS during passive shoulder abduction, pain was not relieved by conventional treatment (common analgesics, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; slings; physical modalities such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation of shoulder muscles or manual therapy). No significant spasticity in the upper shoulder joint, defined as Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score ≤2 , ultrasonographically diagnosed subacromial subdeltoid (SASD ) bursitis. previous shoulder steroid or botulinum toxin A injection in the affected side or known allergy for botulinum toxin.\n\nComplete history will be addressed from all subjects emphasizing the age, sex, type of stroke (hemorrhagic, thrombotic) ,duration of the stroke, side of hemiplegia , duration of shoulder pain .Complete neurological and musculoskeletal examination .All patients will be examined by a single independent physiatrist.\n\nPatients will be classified based on the type of the injected material into 2 categories: 18 patients will be injected by 20 IU botulinum Toxin A, ( BoNT/A) group and 18 patients will be injected by 40 mg methyl prednisolone (steroid group) The assessment of therapeutic effects will be performed at the start of the study, and in the 3rd and 10th weeks. Shoulder pain will quantified by VAS score at rest (night pain ) and during the day ( movement pain ) .\n\nThe physiatrist who will carry out the initial assessment and will perform the intra-articular injection will not participate in follow-up assessments.\n\nUpper limb motor function was assessed sensorimotor function assessment for the upper extremity domain of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) .\n\nSpasticity around the shoulder will be assessed by MAS. Physical disability and behavior related to activities of daily living will be assessed by Modified Barthel ADL index for stroke patients .\n\nSubacromial subdeltoid bursitis(SASD) will be assessed in the paretic shoulder by high frequency probe SASD bursitis if there is thickness ≥ 2mm and / or effusion or both"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subacromial Bursitis","Subdeltoid Bursitis"],"keywords":["stroke","hemiplegia","botulinum toxin","musculoskeletal ultrasound"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botox injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"half of the hemiplegic patients will be injected by botulinum toxin A in the inflamed subacromial-subdeltoid bursa guided by musculoskeletal ultrasound","interventionNames":["Drug: botulinum toxin type A"]},{"label":"methyl prednisolonate injection","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"the other half of the hemiplegic patients will be injected by methylprednisolonate in the inflamed subacromial-subdeltoid bursa guided by musculoskeletal ultrasound","interventionNames":["Drug: Methyl Prednisolonate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"botulinum toxin type A","description":"ultrasound guided injection of the botulinum toxin type A in the inflamed subacromial subdeltoid bursa","armGroupLabels":["Botox injection"],"otherNames":["botox 100 IU"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Methyl Prednisolonate","description":"ultrasound guided injection of Methyl Prednisolonate in the inflamed subacromial subdeltoid bursa","armGroupLabels":["methyl prednisolonate injection"],"otherNames":["Depomedrol 40mg /2ml"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"visual analog scale (VAS) for pain","description":"The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain.
