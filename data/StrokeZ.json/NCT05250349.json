The carotid and cerebral flow will be assessed using Doppler ultrasonography, and cognitive function will be estimated during routine neuropsychological tests.\n\nIt is an observational, three(natural)-group, single-center study. It is also an Academic Registry - the scientific activity of the Faculty of Medicine, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, and John Paul II Hospital.","detailedDescription":"Circumstantial evidence suggests that cognitive dysfunction may occur in HF patients as often undiagnosed comorbidity. Cognitive dysfunction may aggravate HF symptoms and influence prognosis. Cognitive dysfunction may be a reason for inadequate self-care and poor symptom control (e.g., weight gain monitoring). In addition, it may affect medication compliance, leading to hospital readmissions and increased mortality. Brain tissue hypoxia, microemboli, silent strokes, and co-existing anemia have been implicated in contributing to cognitive dysfunction in HF. However, the role of cerebral flow impairment in these patients remains unclear. This uncertainty is mainly because previous studies included small patient groups, diverse imaging techniques, and neuropsychological tests. Furthermore, these studies were primarily conducted in the elderly, a potentially important confounder due to the effect of age on cognitive dysfunction. Particularly little data is available for younger patients (\\< 60 years).\n\nThis study aims to investigate the association of HF, carotid and cerebral flow, and cognitive impairment. Consecutive patients with HF with mildly reduced (HFmrEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) will be included in the study. Echocardiography with routine measurements such as ejection fraction and stroke volume will be performed in each patient. The carotid and cerebral flow will be assessed on Doppler ultrasonography. Each patient will undergo cognitive function assessment using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The results in the index group (isolated HF) will be compared with those in a group of patients with HF and flow-limiting carotid stenosis (CS) against a control group (no HF, no CS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure","Cognitive Impairment","Carotid Stenosis"],"keywords":["Carotid Stenosis","Heart Failure","Carotid Doppler","Transcranial Doppler","Cerebral Flow","Cognitive Impairment","Stroke Volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Isolated HF Group","description":"Patients with echocardiography - confirmed Heart Failure (HFmrEF and HFrEF) and clinical symptoms (NYHA I-III).","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Echocardiography","Diagnostic Test: Doppler sonography","Diagnostic Test: Neuropsychological tests"]},{"label":"HF + CS group","description":"Patients with echocardiography - confirmed Heart Failure (HFmrEF and HFrEF) with NYHA I-III symptoms, who were diagnosed with flow limiting Carotid Stenosis on carotid Doppler ultrasound.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Echocardiography","Diagnostic Test: Doppler sonography","Diagnostic Test: Neuropsychological tests"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"A cohort of patients without Heart Failure or other significant cardiac pathology and without Carotid Stenosis (a paired propensity match will be performed).","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Echocardiography","Diagnostic Test: Doppler sonography","Diagnostic Test: Neuropsychological tests"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Echocardiography","description":"Transthoracic echocardiography with standard measurements","armGroupLabels":["Control group","HF + CS group","Isolated HF Group"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Doppler sonography","description":"Transcarotid and transcranial Doppler sonography","armGroupLabels":["Control group","HF + CS group","Isolated HF Group"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Neuropsychological tests","description":"Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","armGroupLabels":["Control group","HF + CS group","Isolated HF Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with at least moderate (i.e. mild or moderate) cognitive dysfunction (MMSE)","description":"Proportion of patients with at least moderate (i.e. mild or moderate) cognitive dysfunction according to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE score ≥10)","timeFrame":"At six months from HF diagnosis"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with at least moderate (i.e. mild or moderate) cognitive dysfunction (MoCA)","description":"Proportion of patients with at least moderate (i.e. mild or moderate) cognitive dysfunction according to Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA score ≥10)","timeFrame":"At six months from HF diagnosis"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with mild cognitive dysfunction (MMSE)","description":"Proportion of patients with mild cognitive dysfunction according to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE score 20 - 25)","timeFrame":"At six months from HF diagnosis"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with mild cognitive dysfunction (MoCA)","description":"Proportion of patients with mild cognitive dysfunction according to Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA score 18 - 25)","timeFrame":"At six months from HF diagnosis"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with moderate cognitive dysfunction (MMSE)","description":"Proportion of patients with moderate cognitive dysfunction according to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE score 10 - 19)4.
