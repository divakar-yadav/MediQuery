Occupational and physical rehabilitation therapy (OT and PT) combined with non-invasive brain stimulation may help a person recover hand movement.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare 3 non-invasive brain stimulation protocols combined with therapy to see if they result in different amounts of recovery of hand movement after a stroke.","detailedDescription":"This study is a randomized clinical trail (RCT) of stroke survivors with chronic (6 to 24 months) hemiplegia randomized to: 1) conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), 2) unconventional tDCS, or 3) sham tDCS during contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation mediated occupational therapy. The treatment will last 12 weeks and be followed by a 6-month follow-up period. Assessors, therapists and participants will be blinded to which tDCS treatment is received. This will be the first RCT of tDCS + CCFES."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Therapy","Electrical Stimulation","Brain stimulation","Hand","CCFES","Motor Cortex","TMS","Motor Recovery","Central Nervous System","CVA","Upper Limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":63,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active conventional tDCS plus CCFES","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The conventional tDCS montages involves placing the surface anode electrode on the scalp of the lesioned hemisphere and the surface cathode electrode on the scalp of the non-lesioned hemisphere.
