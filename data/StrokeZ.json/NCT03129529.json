Thirty-two stroke patients with spastic equinus were randomly assigned to receive three sessions of either focused shockwave therapy or radial shockwave therapy at 1-week intervals. The intensities that were used during FSWT (0.1 mJ/mm2) and RSWT (2 bar) were comparable. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 4, 8 weeks after the final shockwave treatment. The primary outcome measure was modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score. Secondary outcome measures were Tardieu scale, ankle passive range of motion, plantar contact area during gait, and gait speed. A linear mixed model with repeated measures was used to compare each outcome measure between the two groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"focused shock wave","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment was administered directly to the middle of muscle bellies of the spastic triceps surae muscle in three sessions, with one week interval.
