Patients are screened for depression 1 to 2 months post-stroke. Patients with depression are then randomized to the AIM intervention or control group. Patients without depression are also enrolled at the same time and are matched by hospital site to the depressed patients.\n\nThe AIM intervention is a 3-part program consisting of activating or educating the patient and his/her family about post-stroke depression, instituting treatment for depression, and monitoring antidepressant treatments for side effects, efficacy, and compliance. Control patients are evaluated and treated with usual care by their physicians. Patients without depression do not receive the intervention but complete the same assessments on the same schedule as the patients with depression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression"],"keywords":["stroke","depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":188,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nurse Case management","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: case management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"case management","armGroupLabels":["Nurse Case management"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Twelve Week Depression Outcomes","description":"Depression remission was defined as HAM-D less than 8 or HAM-D decreased by 50%.\n\nThe Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is measured on a scale from no depression - major depression, 0-52 units on a scale.","timeFrame":"Twelve week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* No severe language or cognitive deficits,\n* life expectancy of at least 9 months, and\n* willingness to participate.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Linda Williams, M.D.","affiliation":"Roudebush VA Medical Center Health Services Research and Development 11H","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Indiana University Hospital, 550 N.
