Increased precision in prehospital selection and a more efficient transport chain will lead to an even more rapid start of treatment and thus benefit patients. The research project has two parts: one part collecting data from medical reports and one study with qualitative in-depth interviews. The project will gather data from various parts of Norway and from a University hospital in Switzerland for comparison between regions and countries. Data will be retrieved through intrahospital and prehospital medical records from various parts of Norway (Nordland Hospital, Akershus University Hospital and Helgeland Hospital) and from Basel University hospital in Switzerland. Knowledge of factors associated with delays will be compared for regions in the north and south of Norway, as well as abroad. The information obtained will be analysed to identify components in the chain that may be improved as concerns time saving."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nordlandssykehuset HF"},{"label":"Akershus universitetsssykehus"},{"label":"Helgelandssykehuset"},{"label":"Basel University Hospital"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time delay from ictus to hospital arrival","description":"Delay from first symptoms of stroke until arrival at hospital","timeFrame":"Within 4 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n• Final diagnosis of stroke at discharge from hospital\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n• Hospital admission later than one week from stroke onset","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients discharged from the respective hospitals with a diagnosis of stroke during the period of inclusion.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Rolf Salvesen","city":"Bodø","zip":"8092","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":67.28,"lon":14.40501}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
