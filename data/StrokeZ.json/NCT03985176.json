There is still only a limited understanding of the mechanisms of secondary insults causing brain injury after SAH, also called delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).\n\nIn this study, the investigators are exploring the use of quantifiable biomarkers from blood and continuous EEG monitoring as tools for the diagnostics of DCI. Additionally, the investigators are looking into other clinical variables (eg. pain, heart function) as factors of DCI.","detailedDescription":"Subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH) is a cause of long-term disability and death. Annually about 1000 people in Finland suffer from SAH, their average age being under 50 years. SAH has a mortality rate of 12 % acutely and 40 % of patients die within a month from admission to hospital. In addition, 30 % of the surviving patients remain with neurological deficits. Most survivors of the primary insult suffer from a secondary injury during the first 2-3 weeks from the insult.\n\nDespite the advances in neurosurgical and -radiological techniques and intensive care, the mortality and morbidity rates in SAH have not changed in recent years. There is still only a limited understanding of the mechanisms of secondary insults causing brain injury after SAH, also called delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).\n\nIn this study, the investigators are exploring the use of quantifiable biomarkers from blood and continuous EEG monitoring as tools for the diagnostics of DCI.
