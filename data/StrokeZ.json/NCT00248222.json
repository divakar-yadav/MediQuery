Patients after a minor ischemic stroke would be randomized within 1-3 weeks of stroke onset to a control group (6 weeks of low intensity stretching and coordination exercises followed by a supervised aerobic training program) or an experimental group (immediate aerobic training program). Patients will be evaluated for measures of ambulation endurance, mobility, gait, functional assessment and clinical follow-up after 6 weeks and again 3 months later."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Exercise","Rehabilitation","Aerobic training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Supervised aerobic training"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 Minute Walk Test at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Bruce Exercise Test at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Activity by Ankle accelerometer at 6 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent vascular events at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"METS at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Stair climbing ascend and descend test at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Four Square Step Test at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Gait symmetry by SmartStep at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Walking Impairment Questionnaire at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Rivermead Mobility Index at 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Similar outcome measures 3 months later"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* minor ischemic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* unstable angina\n* severe lung disease\n* severe symptomatic peripheral vascular disease\n* dementia or other severe neurological disease\n* other severe uncontrolled medical problem","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"David Tanne, MD","affiliation":"Sheba Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chaim Sheba Medical Center","city":"Tel Hashomer","zip":"52621","country":"Israel","geoPoint":{"lat":32.04195,"lon":34.85623}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
