Half of the participants will receive active EEG neurofeedback sessions first, followed by sham feedback sessions in a crossover design. The other half of participants will undergo sham feedback sessions first, followed by active neurofeedback.","detailedDescription":"Neurofeedback, a form of biofeedback, provides a visual and/or audio representation of an individual's neural electrical activity from live EEG recording. Using operant conditioning principles, individuals are trained to increase or reduce patterns of brainwave activity to modify behavior and performance. Although neurofeedback has not yet been investigated as a treatment for aphasia or other communication deficits due to stroke or neurodegenerative disease, it may be effective. Previous studies have observed improvement in cognitive and behavioral measures in those with conditions such as Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Furthermore, it has been associated with reduced anxiety and sleep disruption, which both exacerbate language and communication impairments. Research is needed to determine if neurofeedback may be an effective treatment for language disorders such as PPA and post-stroke communication disorders.\n\nIt is possible that EEG neurofeedback, which focuses on improving abnormal brainwave patterns, could provide certain therapeutic benefits to individuals with PPA or post-stroke aphasia, either by directly affecting neural networks that underlie language, or more generally by reducing anxiety and inattention through behavioral conditioning. Reduction of anxiety in neurological diseases can be beneficial not only for functional performance but also sleep duration and quality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Primary Progressive Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["communication","language","speech","anxiety","sleep","neurofeedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"To evaluate the effects of EEG neurofeedback on communication skills in participants with post-stroke aphasia and primary progressive aphasia (PPA), this study will utilize a randomized double-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject crossover trial design.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active EEG Neurofeedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 sessions of active EEG neurofeedback at a frequency of 3-5 sessions per week for a duration of 3-5 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: EEG Neurofeedback"]},{"label":"Sham Feedback","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"15 sessions of sham neurofeedback at a frequency of 3-5 sessions per week for a duration of 3-5 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Feedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"EEG Neurofeedback","description":"Active EEG neurofeedback","armGroupLabels":["Active EEG Neurofeedback"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham Feedback","description":"Sham EEG feedback sessions identical to active sessions except that the feedback given to the participant will not be based on the individual's live EEG activity.","armGroupLabels":["Sham Feedback"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Number of content units expressed in the Picture Description Test","description":"Change in Number of content units expressed by the participant when describing what is seen in a picture.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 week following each intervention period and 8 weeks following both intervention periods"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in number of items correctly named on the Philadelphia Naming Test","description":"Change in number of items correctly named on a behavioral picture naming assessment.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 week following each intervention period and 8 weeks following both intervention periods"},{"measure":"Change in Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA) score","description":"This is a measure of attention, executive function, and word-retrieval.
