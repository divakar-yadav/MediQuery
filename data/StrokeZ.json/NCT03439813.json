It aims to evaluate the feasibility of i) web-enabled trial procedures, and ii) the TASK intervention in stroke and TIA patients","detailedDescription":"Anxiety after stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is common. It is distressing and potentially debilitating. Currently, post-stoke psychological care is inadequate. There is no definitive evidence to guide treatment of anxiety post-stroke.\n\nThe TASK intervention is a centralized model for delivering personalised therapy for treating anxiety post-stroke using telephone and web-technology.\n\nThe TASK intervention includes:\n\n* Treatment website and telephone support\n* Learning ways to overcome anxiety after stroke/'mini-stroke'\n* Relaxation techniques\n* Weekly online tasks\n* Therapeutic videos\n* Text reminders and participant record card\n* Useful links to stroke resources and websites\n\nThe investigators designed the TASK trial to be web-enabled, so that it can be conducted entirely remotely.\n\nIn the TASK feasibility randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of:\n\ni) web-enabled trial procedures: online recruitment, remote eligibility checking, electronic informed consent, online self-reported outcome surveys\n\nii) feasibility of the TASK intervention in stroke and TIA patients\n\nThis trial received a favourable opinion from the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee (ref: 17/SS/0143)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anxiety Disorders","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["stroke","transient ischemic attack","anxiety","psychotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participant receives one of the two TASK interventions.
