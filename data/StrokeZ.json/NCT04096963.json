The primary Effectiveness Endpoint is the occurrence of non-effective LAA closure defined as any peri-device flow \\> 5mm demonstrated by TEE/CT/MRI at First Follow-up.The primary safety endpoint is the occurrence of one of the following events between the time of implant and within 7 days following the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever is later: all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, AV fistula repair, or other major endovascular repair. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 12 months from the time of implant."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The WATCHMAN FLX Delivery System","description":"Patients who are eligible for a WATCHMAN FLX device according to current international and local guidelines (and future revisions) and per physician discretion;","interventionNames":["Device: The WATCHMAN FLX Delivery System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"The WATCHMAN FLX Delivery System","description":"WATCHMAN FLX Delivery System permit device placement in the LAA via femoral venous access and crossing the inter-atrial septum into the left atrium","armGroupLabels":["The WATCHMAN FLX Delivery System"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The occurrence of non-effective LAA closure defined as any peri-device flow > 5mm","description":"The occurrence of non-effective LAA closure defined as any peri-device flow \\> 5mm demonstrated by TEE/CT/MRI at First Follow-up.","timeFrame":"First Follow-up (30 ~ 100 days);"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
