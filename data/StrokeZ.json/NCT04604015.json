Additionally, up to 150 evaluable subjects will be evaluated with NB-IS TCD and standard of care TEE.","detailedDescription":"The objectives of the study is to evaluate the shunt detection rate of the NeuralBot Investigational System (NB-IS) TCD relative to standard of care diagnostic techniques (transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and standard transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and to assess the safety, accuracy and usability of the NB-IS device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source","Transient Ischemic Attack","Right-To-Left Atrial Shunt","Patent Foramen Ovale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"The NeuralBot Investigational System is comprised of both the Lucid M1 System and the NeuralBot accessory. The NeuralBot accessory must be used with the Lucid M1 System and cannot operate independently. The NB-IS is a modification of a 510k cleared device called NeuralBot Guided Head mounted Accessory (K180455;22May2018). The NeuralBot Investigational System is the investigational study device used in this study.\n\nThe NeuralBot Investigational System (NB-IS) moves two ultrasound probes around the two temporal regions (Right and Left) of the head to find the transtemporal window and then optimizes cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) measurements. The system uses TCD data to systematically specify and evaluate probe positions. The NeuralBot Investigational System consists of a head-support structure that houses two probe positioning modules, a robotic controller unit and computer tablets. The NeuralBot Investigational System is non-invasive and does not deliver energy into a subject.","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"All de-identified imaging data will be sent to a core laboratory which will provide independent quantitative and qualitative assessment of all NB-IS TCD and Standard of care (SOC) TCD, TTE, and TEE bubble study data.
