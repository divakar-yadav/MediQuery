The study will also explore the views of non-ambulatory stroke survivors and their carers on: needs, personal goals, barriers, and motivators, experiences of programme participated in and preferred format (i.e. home-based individual/ community-based groups).","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nPhysical activity interventions after stroke are needed because stroke survivors are under-active; their average physical fitness level is about 50% of sedentary healthy controls. This adversely affects vascular risk factor profiles, disability and participation, problems that are all likely to be exacerbated in stroke survivors who are unable to walk. Fitness can be improved after stroke through cardiorespiratory training. This also improves psychosocial functioning and adaptation to life after stroke. Community-based services for exercise after stroke are developing throughout the UK. However, current evidence, associated guidelines and exercise professional training mainly pertain to ambulatory stroke survivors; non-ambulatory stroke survivors have hardly been involved in this area of research. In this study, we define \"non-ambulatory\" as requiring at least \"continuous or intermittent support of one person to help with balance or coordination\" (i.e. Functional Ambulatory Category ≤ 2).\n\nStudy aim:\n\nThe aim of this study is to design a physical activity programme for non-ambulatory stroke survivors (delivered via either community-based groups or a home-based individual programme) and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, preliminary and adverse effects. The study will also explore the views of non-ambulatory stroke survivors and their carers on: needs, personal goals, barriers, and motivators, experiences of programme participated in and preferred format (i.e. home-based individual/ community-based groups).\n\nStudy design:\n\nMixed-methods, observational feasibility study. This study will incorporate qualitative interviews/focus groups to explore the experiences of the programme participants are taking part in and their thoughts and views of PA after stroke. Interviews and focus groups will be conducted throughout the physical activity programme.\n\nParticipant recruitment:\n\nParticipants will be recruited by the Scottish Stroke Research Network (SRN) via: databases and electronic patient medical/nursing/AHP notes, records of discharges from acute stroke wards to off-site rehabilitation units and word of mouth among AHPs., within NHS Lanarkshire.\n\nParticipants will also be recruited via non-NHS sites: local community stroke groups, social media, stroke charities, press releases and related media and care homes.\n\nStudy setting:\n\nGlasgow Caledonian University will be used for the community-based group programme and focus groups/interviews.\n\nParticipants' own home setting will be used for the home-based, individual programme and interviews.\n\nStudy participants:\n\nNon-ambulatory stroke survivors and their carers (where applicable) living at home or in care homes.\n\nStudy outcomes:\n\nOutcomes will include measures of disability, ADL, strength, anxiety and depression, sedentary behaviour, self-efficacy, health status, attainment of individual goals, as well as carer burden (where appropriate).\n\nFeasibility will be assessed by numbers of participants invited to participate, accepting and being recruited into the study, completing the intervention, programme adherence and drop outs. Safety data will be examined using data on adverse effects reported by participants.\n\nStudy duration: 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["physical activity","exercise","non-ambulatory","feasibility","mixed methods"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Participants can select either individual treatment at home, or group treatment in a community setting, but the intervention content and dose are the same.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Blinding: outcomes are assessed by independent assessors, otherwise not involved in the study."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Physical activity","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A tailored, person-centred, 12-week, chair-based exercise intervention to increase physical activity and fitness.
