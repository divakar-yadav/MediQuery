Aerobic exercise is known to improve health by increasing energy levels, physical mobility, balance, bone health, cardiovascular risk reduction, mental well-being, cognition, sleep, and quality of life. Nonetheless, people remain woefully inactive after stroke, regardless if they are in hospital or at home. The current investigative team and others have shown that even during physiotherapy, exercise intensity is not adequate to increase physical fitness. Consequently, patients are often deprived of a treatment that could improve their recovery. Why does this gap between evidence and clinical practice persist? Through a national survey the current team found that an important contributing factor is lack of appropriate screening (especially stress tests) to ensure that patients are safe to engage in aerobic exercise. This project is designed to close this evidence-practice gap by establishing a state-of-the-art aerobic exercise screening and prescription clinic at the Nova Scotia Rehabilitation Centre (NSRC). The intent is to compare outcomes of stroke rehabilitation participants before and after the clinic is underway and determine if the clinic has a positive effect on the confidence of NSRC physiotherapists to use aerobic exercise safely and effectively in stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Research question: To what extent does an on-site aerobic exercise screening and prescription clinic effect uptake of aerobic exercise and patient outcomes in in-patient stroke rehabilitation?\n\nDesign: Pre-post cohort design to explore real-world application and feasibility\n\nAim 1. Establish an aerobic exercise screening and prescription clinic (herein 'Aerobics Clinic') at the NSRC.\n\nAim 2. Assess the potential impact of the Aerobics Clinic on the self-efficacy of physiotherapists at NSRC regarding clinical utilization of aerobic exercise in in-patient stroke rehabilitation.\n\nMethod: An assessment of the physiotherapy participants' self-efficacy regarding the clinical utilization of aerobic exercise post-stroke will be conducted prior to, and after, implementation of the Clinic.\n\nAim 3: Assess the potential impact of the Aerobics Clinic on prescription and treatment practices regarding aerobic exercise among patients in stroke rehabilitation at the NSRC.\n\nMethod: Prior to, and after, implementation of the Clinic the actual utilization of aerobic exercise in the practices of the physiotherapy participants will be assessed using heart rate monitoring, activity monitoring, and health record review."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","aerobic exercise","screening","prescription"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pre-Clinic Stroke Group","description":"In- or out-patients with diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke who have been referred to the NSRC prior to the establishment of the Clinic and are willing/able to provide written informed consent and have no contraindications to exercise testing.
