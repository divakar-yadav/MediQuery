A control population of patients with known vascular disease but without recent ACS, stroke/TIA will also be recruited.\n\nFERMATA is a pilot, single- centerre, imaging study. We will evaluate the ability of the amyloid tracer, 18F-Florbetaben, to detect active atherosclerotic plaque in patients with recent ACS, or recent TIA/stroke. We plan to enroll 24 patients with ACS or patients with stroke/TIA and 6 control patients without recent ACS or stroke/TIA. Primary endpoint is the difference in Florbetaben uptake between the culprit artery (of either the ACS or TIA/stroke, respectively), and the non-culprit arteries. Parameters of interest are the maximal and total standard uptake values (SUVs) and tissue-to- background ratios (TBRs) of the coronary and carotid arteries as well as aorta.\n\nExploratory endpoints include a correlation analysis (Pearson correlation) to evaluate the relationship of inflammation on Florbetaben PET/CT to the histopathological levels of inflammation. In addition, we will look to see if Florbetaben uptake on PET correlates with lesion levels of B-amyloid. Comparisons will also be made between regions of high plaque burden vs lower plaque burden and between patients with recent vascular events vs those who have not had recent events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Coronary Syndrome","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Atherosclerosis of Artery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute atherosclerotic disease event group","description":"Patients with a recent ACS (i.e. STEMI or NSTEMI), stroke or transient ischemic attack."},{"label":"Control","description":"A control population of patients with known vascular disease but without recent ACS, stroke/TIA."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of using 18F-Florbetaben PET in patients with recent ACS or stroke/TIA to detect inflammatory plaque","description":"Ratio of the standardized uptake value (SUV) of Florbetaben tracer to the background (SVC or internal jugular for coronary or carotid respectively)","timeFrame":"Within 16 weeks of vascular event"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"TBR of arteries in acute patients compared to control patients","description":"Tissue to background (TBR) of arteries in patients with acute vascular events compared to TBR in arteries of control patients","timeFrame":"Within 16 weeks of vascular event"},{"measure":"TBR of arteries in with higher plaque burden compared to lower plaque burden","description":"Tissue to background (TBR) of arteries in patients with higher plaque burden on CT compared to TBR in arteries of lower plaque burden","timeFrame":"Within 16 weeks of vascular event"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. suffered a recent cardiovascular event (30-120 days post ACS (i.e. STEMI or NSTEMI) or TIA/stroke with ipsilateral large vessel atherosclerotic disease confirmed on US, CT or MRI;\n2. stable symptoms and hemodynamics;\n3. age \\>/= 18 years;\n4. given informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. a recent CV event likely to have been embolic in the opinion of the neurologist or cardiologist;\n2. severe LV dysfunction (EF\\<30%);\n3. severe valve disease requiring intervention;\n4. decompensated heart failure;\n5. pregnancy (all women of child bearing potential will have a negative BHCG test;\n6. breastfeeding;\n7.
