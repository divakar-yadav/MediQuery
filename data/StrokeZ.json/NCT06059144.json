A possible mechanism is hypoperfusion due to lack of a rapid development of collateral flow because of the terminal distribution of perforating arteries. Moreover, arterioles are maximally dilated within penumbra region, resulting in a cerebral autoregulation failure and a passive dependence of cerebral blood flow on arterial pressure. Thus, induced-hypertension therapy by using vasopressive agents is an attractive therapy to increase the cerebral perfusion pressure and therefore restore blood flow in the ischemic penumbra."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":358,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Induced hypertension using norepinephrine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard care and peripheral intravenous norepinephrine.
