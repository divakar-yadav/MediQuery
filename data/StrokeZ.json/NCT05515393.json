Patients who met the inclusion criteria for the protocol were stratified randomly and assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to three groups: the XY03-EA 300mg, 600mg two-dose group, and the placebo group. The study was divided into 3 stages: screening stage, treatment stage and follow-up stage.

The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment.
