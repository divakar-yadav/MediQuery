Numerous reports have confirmed its strongest endogenous neuroprotection against brain injury after stroke, of which the immune mechanisms are majorly involved in RIC. At the same time, the inflammation response plays a great role in stroke development, which may expand the infarct area. Stroke-induced immunodeficiency can potentiate stroke-associated pneumonia, which is an important cause of death after strokes. In this study, the investigators will assess the effect of RIC on stroke-induced immunodeficiency and inflammation response in AIS patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Remote ischemic preconditioning","Stroke-induced immunodeficiency","Stroke-associated Pneumonia","inflammation response"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AIS-RIC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RIC is a physical strategy performed through cuffs placed on the unilateral arm and inflated to 180 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflation for 5-min, the procedures are performed repeatedly for 5 times.
