Endovascular treatment may be beneficial in selected patients beyond 6 hour time window. In particular, treatment response to endovascular therapy may be greatly influenced by pretreatment collateral status. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether MRI-based collateral imaging (the Fast Analysis SysTem for COLLaterals, 'FAST-COLL') is feasible and can predict the response to endovascular treatment in a wide range of patients with acute ischemic stroke ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Collateral status","Endovascular treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular treatment","description":"Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy or endovascular delivery of thrombolytic agent"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"90-days functional outcome","description":"90-days modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2","timeFrame":"90-days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early neurologic improvement","description":"An 8-point or more improvement on the NIH score when comparing the baseline score or a NIHSS score of 0-1, at 24 hours.","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation","description":"Occurrence of an increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 4 or more points in the setting of local or remote parenchymal hematoma.","timeFrame":"During initial admission"},{"measure":"Successful recanalization","description":"Defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) ≥ 2b","timeFrame":"within 24 hours of symptom onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke\n* Age 20 years and older\n* Disabling stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS \\> 5 at the time of arrival\n* Onset (last-seen-well) time to endovascular treatment time \\< 12 hours\n* Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on CT or MR angiography, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs)\n* Signed informed consent or appropriate signed deferral of consent where approved\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Baseline non-contrast CT reveals a moderate/large core defined as extensive early ischemic changes of ASPECTS 0-5 in the territory of symptomatic intracranial occlusion.\n* Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic\n* Unable to undergo MRI (contraindicated or poor cooperation)\n* Patient has a severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient\n* Pregnant females as determined by positive urine hCG test or lactating females","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute ischemic stroke, eligible for endovascular treatment within 12 hours of symptom onset","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jong-Won Chung, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82234103599","email":"neurocjw@gmail.com"},{"name":"Yun Jeong Lim, RN","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82221489697","email":"smcyunjeong@naver.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Oh Young Bang, MD","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Seoul","zip":"135710","country":"Korea, Republic of","contacts":[{"name":"Jong-Won Chung, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82234101895","email":"neurocjw@gmail.com"},{"name":"Oh Young Bang, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Kwang Ho Lee, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Chin-Sang Chung, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Gyeong-Moon Kim, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Jong-Won Chung, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31554502","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Yu I, Bang OY, Chung JW, Kim YC, Choi EH, Seo WK, Kim GM, Menon BK, Demchuk AM, Goyal M, Hill MD.
