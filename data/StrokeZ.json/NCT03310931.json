Despite some straight forward causes, DWI lesion growth is reportedly a primary underlying mechanism. Early recognition of END risk would allow for timely identification and proper intervention, improving stroke health care.\n\nThromboelastography (TEG) measures the coagulation process from initial clotting cascade to clot strength, providing an integrated picture of two separate but simultaneously occuring components of coagulation, thrombosis and lysis. It has been reported to be associated with short and long-term outcome in patients with trauma, coronary artery diseases , pulmonary embolism and, most recently, stroke prevention.The purposes of this study is to evaluate how effective TEG is on predicting END, by producing a range of TEG values correlated with clinical and radiological assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"thrombelastography on admission"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"End and non-END groups","description":"END was denied as NIHSS score increase of 2 or more than 2 within 7 days after admission"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"END","description":"increase of NIHSS \\>=2","timeFrame":"fist week after admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"DWI lesion growth","description":"Large volume or new lesions on followup DWI than the baseline DWI","timeFrame":"7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours after symptom onset\n* first ever stroke\n* give informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* receiving thrombolysis\n* cardiogenic embolism\n* contradiction to serial MRI studies\n* taking hemostatic agents (warfarin, oral anticoagulants and etc. )","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The study population includes consecutively admitted patients with acute ischemic stroke in Dongguan people's Hospital.
