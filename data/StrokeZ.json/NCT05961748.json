This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program. To establish a domestic multi-center, large-scale \"brain-heart comorbidity\" dynamic database platform including clinical, sample database, image and other multi-dimensional information requirements, through the construction of a multi-center intelligent scientific research integration platform based on artificial intelligence.\n\nAny of newly diagnosed cardiovascular related diseases were identified via ICD-10-CM codes: I21, I22, I24 (Ischaemic heart diseases) \\[i.e., ACS\\], I46 (cardiac arrest), I48 (Atrial fibrillation/flutter), I50 (Heart failure), I71 (Aortic disease), I60 (subarachnoid hemorrhage), I61 (intracerebral hemorrhage), I63 (Cerebral infarction), I65 (Occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries), I66 (Occlusion and stenosis of cerebral arteries), I67.1 (cerebral aneurysm), I67.5 (moyamoya diseases), Q28.2 (Arteriovenous malformation of cerebral vessels).\n\nThe data is stored on the brain-heart comorbidity warehouse via a physical server at the institution's data centre or a virtual hosted appliance. The brain-heart comorbidity platform comprises of a series of these appliances connected into a multicenter network. This network can broadcast queries to each appliance. Results are subsequently collected and aggregated. Once the data is sent to the network, it is mapped to a standard and controlled set of clinical terminologies and undergoes a data quality assessment including 'data cleaning' that rejects records which do not meet the brain-heart comorbidity quality standards. The brain-heart comorbidity warehouse performs internal and extensive data quality assessment with every refresh based on conformance, completeness, and plausibility
