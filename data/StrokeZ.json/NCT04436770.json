Initial and final clinical and functional evaluation of patients with post-stroke sequelae, storage and use of data obtained.\n2. Collection and access of demographic and clinical data of patients included in the study (respecting the principle of confidentiality and non-publication of personal data) only by staff involved in the research project and working in the Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology in Brasov.\n3. Application of Virtual Reality therapy and occupational therapy versus and standard physiotherapy and occupational therapy to patients who meet the criteria for inclusion in the study (scapulohumeral flexion and abduction of at least 20 degrees, elbow flexion of at least 20 degrees, hip and knee flexion of at least 20 degrees, without severe aphasia or severe behavioural/cognitive disorders).\n4.
