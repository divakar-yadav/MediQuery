However, its role in outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of T-I as a predictive biomarker of short-term outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients. Methods: This study included 72 acute ischemic stroke participants were treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. All participants were subjected to general and neurological evaluation including assessment of stroke severity using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission and investigations including measurement of serum level of T-I on admission. Outcome was assessed three months after stroke onset using NIHSS and modified Rankin scale (mRS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","troponin-I","outcome","intravenous thrombolytic therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Serum troponin I (T-I) was collected at hospital admission at the emergency department, before any treatment.
