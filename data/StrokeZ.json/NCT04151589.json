The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-modal medical quality improvement measures on the delay of hospital-level emergency work flow of acute ischemic stroke management as well as its impact on patient prognosis. The interventional measures include emergency work flow management app on smartphone, specialized training, assessment of quality improvement outcomes and feedback on a regular basis.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, multi-centre, cluster randomized, open label, parallel controlled study that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular treatment in about 34 hospitals in China. The ratio Interventional arm control arm is 1:1, which means 17 hospitals and 332 participants in each arm."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Artery Occlusion With Infarction (Disorder)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":664,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Interventional Site","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The process below will be allocated in Interventional Sites:\n\n1.

Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems (labelled 1-3). The respondent is asked to indicate his / her health state by checking the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine'( score as 100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (score as 0).
