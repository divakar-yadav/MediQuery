Spasticity, according to Lance, is a motor disease characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with excessive tendon jerks, due to hyper excitability stretch reflex.Furthermore, long-term untreated spasticity can cause discomfort, contractures, and deformities, which can lead to functional issues such as mobility limitations, reliance on (ADL), and a lower quality of life.There is multiple option to treat spasticity including pharmacological and rehabilitation Pharmacological treatments that can be focal or systematic and have partial effects and eventually need of physical therapy There are many PT procedures which includes stretching neurodevelopment techniques and many others to prevent spasticity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spastic Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Dry needling","Modified Ashworth Scale","Goniometer","Range of Motion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"There are two groups.Group A experimental group which receive dry needling protocol along with conventional therapy.Group B is control group which receive sustained stretching protocol along with conventional therapy.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The participants are blinded towards treatment groups.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dry needling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This intervention was for three weeks in which there are 2 sessions per week.
