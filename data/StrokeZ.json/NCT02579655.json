Although medications and lifestyle changes can improve the health of these patients, many do not benefit from these treatments due to barriers at the level of the patient, provider and/or health system, resulting in a care gap. Multiple barriers may contribute to the observed care gap for patients with these chronic diseases-but prior research has identified that 1) out-of-pocket costs for medications (including co-payments); and 2) lack of patient knowledge about the potential benefits of treatment are particularly important. Although these barriers clearly compromise outcomes among people with chronic diseases, the best way to overcome them and close the care gap is uncertain.\n\nIn the ACCESS trial, the investigators will study the effect of two novel interventions in 4764 participants with chronic disease. The investigators hypothesize that (1) eliminating copayments for high value cardioprotective medications and (2) a comprehensive patient education program on optimal medication use, combined with relay of information on optimal medication use by the patient to their health care provider, will decrease the risk of adverse clinical outcomes during the follow-up period.\n\nMethods and study design: Parallel, open label, factorial randomized controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation assessing the impact of two interventions: 1) elimination of patient copayment for selected medications, and 2) patient education with relay of information to the participant's health care provider."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Disease","Stroke","Chronic Kidney Disease","Heart Failure","Diabetes Mellitus","Hypertension","Hypercholesterolemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4764,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Copayment Elimination and Personalized Education","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, participants would have copayment elimination (no cost for preventative medications for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) and free enrollment in a new personalized education program to help participants manage their chronic conditions","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Copayment Elimination","Behavioral: Personalized Education"]},{"label":"Copayment Elimination Only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, participant's would be randomized to Copayment Elimination (no cost for preventative medications for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) and receive some basic educational information about their chronic disease","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Copayment Elimination"]},{"label":"Personalized Education Only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, participants would be randomized to free enrollment in a new personalized education program to help patients manage their chronic conditions","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Personalized Education"]},{"label":"No intervention","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"In this arm, participants will have access to some basic online educational information about their chronic disease.
