There have also been a number of journal reports of the benefits of treatment with BMSC for diseases and damage to nervous tissue. The investigators hope to add to the volume of literature regarding the use of BMSC in those neurologic diseases and conditions identified as likely to respond to this treatment.\n\nIntravenous administration of BMSC is a well-established approach to neurologic disease and injury with much support for its effectiveness in the pre-clinical and clinical literature. BMSC and the associated bone marrow fraction are posited to have a number of different mechanisms by which they may potentially improve neurologic function. In regards their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier for potential neuronal transdifferentiation and direct impact on the neurons and glial tissue within the brain, it should be remembered that within the diencephalon there are specific circumventricular organs which lie in the wall of the third ventricle. These are noteworthy for a significantly diminished blood-brain barrier and glial limitans which facilitates their function of coordinating homeostatic mechanisms of the endocrine and nervous systems. Therefore the investigators believe entry of BMSC may be facilitated in this area of the brain.\n\nThe NEST Study provides a treatment Arm 1 which combines intravenous BMSC with topical application of BMSC to the lower 1/3 of the nasal passages as a means of introducing BMSC to the Central Nervous System (CNS). This is applied bilaterally to the inferior nasal conchas and meatuses. The Trigeminal Nerve or 5th Cranial Nerve is a paired, large sensory and motor nerve with multiple branches. It provides sensation to the surface and interior structures of the face including the nasal mucosa that lines the nose. The nerves of the Trigeminal Nerve providing sensation to this area converge and enter the brain at the level of the pons. There is documentation in the scientific literature that intranasal delivery of BMSC allows the BMSC to follow the pathways of the trigeminal nerve, facilitating entry into the parenchyma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for effects on the CNS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Disorders","Nervous System Diseases","Neurodegenerative Diseases","Neurological Disorders","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Cadasil","Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebral Ischemia","Cerebral Stroke","Cerebral Hemorrhage","Parkinson","Multi-System Degeneration","MSA - Multiple System Atrophy","Progressive Supranuclear Palsy","ALS","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Neuropathy","Diabetic Neuropathies","Alzheimer Disease","Dementia","Frontotemporal Dementia","Lewy Body Disease","Cognitive Impairment","Lewy Body Variant of Alzheimer Disease"],"keywords":["Neurologic Disease","Cerebral Vascular Accident","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinsons Disease","Neuropathy","Diabetic Neuropathy","Cerebral Ischemia","Cognitive Impairment","Dementia","Neurodegeneration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Intravenous and intranasal bone marrow derived stem cells.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1- Intravenous and Intranasal BMSC","type":"OTHER","description":"Intervention- Autologous bone marrow aspiration and separation of Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cell (BMSC) fraction then provided intravenously and intranasally (lower 1/3 of nasal passages).","interventionNames":["Procedure: Intravenous and Intranasal BMSC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Intravenous and Intranasal BMSC","description":"Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells provided intravenous and intranasal (lower 1/3 of nose)","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1- Intravenous and Intranasal BMSC"],"otherNames":["IV and IN BMSC"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Neurologic Function","description":"Neurologic function from prior to treatment (0 month) and the change in neurologic function at 1,3,6 and 12 months post treatment will be compared to pretreatment using the Neuro-QOL (Neurology Quality of Life) questionnaire.

Have documented functional damage to the central or peripheral nervous system unlikely to improve with present standard of care.\n2. Be at least 6 months post-onset of the disease.\n3. If under current medical therapy (pharmacologic or surgical treatment) for the condition be considered stable on that treatment and unlikely to have reversal of the associated neurologic functional damage as a result of the ongoing pharmacologic or surgical treatment.\n4.

Be over the age of 18 and capable of providing informed consent.\n6. Be medically stable and able to be medically cleared by their primary care physician or a licensed primary care practitioner for the procedure. Medical clearance means that in the estimation of the primary care practitioner, the patient can reasonably be expected to undergo the procedure without significant medical risk to health.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. All patients must be capable of an adequate neurologic examination and evaluation to document the pathology. This will include the ability to cooperate with the exam.\n2. Patients must be capable and willing to undergo follow up neurologic exams with the sub-investigators or their own neurologists as outlined in the protocol.\n3. Patients must be capable of providing informed consent.\n4. In the estimation of Dr. Weiss the BMSC collection and treatment will not present a significant risk of harm to the patient's general health or to their neurologic function. .\n5. Patients who are not medically stable or who may be at significant risk to their health undergoing the procedure will not be eligible.\n6.
