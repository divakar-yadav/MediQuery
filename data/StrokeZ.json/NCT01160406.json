Starting within 14 days of the ischemic stroke, participating patients are asked to perform 10 second ECG recordings using a handheld ECG device twice daily (mornings and evenings) during 30 days. These recordings are transmitted via telephone to a secure encrypted Internet site. Within these 30 days the participants also perform an ambulatory 24 hour Holter recording. Handheld ECG recordings are evaluated continuously. In case of atrial fibrillation the patient is informed and offered treatment with anti coagulant medication (Warfarin). The investigation is a comparison between 24 hour continuous ECG recordings and short intermittent ECG recordings twice daily over a longer time period to determine which method is the best to detect atrial fibrillation in this patient group.\n\nHypothesis: Short Intermittent ECG recordings over a longer time period is more efficient, compared with continuous 24 hour ECG recordings, in detecting silent paroxysmal AF in patients with an ischemic stroke and without a history of atrial fibrillation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["silent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","stroke","tele ECG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ischemic stroke, no atrial fibrillation","description":"Patients who have suffered ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack without known atrial fibrillation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* No previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation.\n* Acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack verified by computed tomography or clinical diagnosis using the National Institute of Health Stroke Score within 14 days of enrollment.\n* Ability to understand study instructions both verbal and written.\n* Ability to perform and transmit ECG recordings according to study design.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation.\n* Hemorrhagic stroke\n* Low compliance\n* Pacemaker carrier","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients from hospital strokewards.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mårten Rosenqvist, M.D.Ph.D.","affiliation":"Karolinska Institutet","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Halmstad hospital","city":"Halmstad","state":"Halland","zip":"30180","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":56.67446,"lon":12.85676}},{"facility":"South hospital","city":"Stockholm","zip":"11883","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":59.33258,"lon":18.0649}},{"facility":"Danderyds hospital AB","city":"Stockholm","zip":"18288","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":59.33258,"lon":18.0649}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
