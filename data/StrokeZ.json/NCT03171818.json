It will be investigated whether intravenous administered darbepoetin can induce the formation of neuronal tissue and restore brain function in neonates who suffered from PAIS compared to placebo treated controls. The ultimate goal of this study is therefore to develop a therapy using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) such as darbepoetin to reduce or even prevent lifelong consequences of PAIS-related brain injury in this group of term newborns."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["PAIS","Neonatal Stroke","Perinatal Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"An international multicenter, randomized placebo controlled intervention study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"This will be a double-blinded study, meaning that both the patient (and his/her parents) and the health care providers, including neonatologist, pediatrician, nurses, physiotherapists, etc, are not allowed to know what treatment the patient has been given.
