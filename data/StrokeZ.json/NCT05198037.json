This proposal aims to study the link between the stress-responsive FKBP51-related pathways and neural plasticity after stroke, elucidating FKBP5 gene polymorphisms and blood FKBP51 regulation in relation to brain excitability and functions, understanding the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation, and characterizing brain mechanisms for individualized early rehabilitation after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stress is an underestimated risk factor and also a consequence of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) modulates stress responses by acting as a co-chaperone that negatively regulates glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to cortisol binding and nuclear signaling. In an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of acute mouse hippocampal slices, FKBP5 deletion reduced ischemic neuronal hyperexcitation, and cathodal electrical stimulation of OGD-injured wild-type decreased FKBP51 levels. However, clinical implications of FKBP5 polymorphisms and FKBP51 regulation in post-stroke outcomes and neuromodulation-induced plasticity are unknown. We aim to assess the link between FKBP5 polymorphisms and blood FKBP51 regulation after stroke, and their relationship with stroke phenotypes, brain connectivity and functional outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","FKBP5","Motor","Transcranial direct current stimulation","Plasticity","Stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Anticipated 100 participants are assigned to the experimental or sham-controlled groups with an allocation rate of 1:1, for the clinical trial.
