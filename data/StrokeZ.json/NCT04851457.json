However, interventional procedures can cause endothelial injuries leading to local activation of platelet aggregation and subsequent thromboembolic complications or early re-occlusion.Tirofiban is a specific antagonist of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, which is considered highly effective against the final common pathway of platelet aggregation and preventing vascular reocclusion. However, there is no consensus on if AIS patients treated with MT also benefit from intravenous tirofiban. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of profiles of tirofiban during MT and provide reliable clinical evidence for the treatment of tirofiban in AIS patients.","detailedDescription":"This study is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, blinded-endpoint trial with two parallel groups and a 3-month follow-up. A total of 200 eligible participants recruited from 4-6 stroke centers will be randomly allocated to either an experimental group (intravenous tirofiban + MT therapy) or a control group (MT alone) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint, including the rate of recanalisation after the first embolectomy and the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The secondary outcomes include clinical and neuroimaging outcomes, procedure-related complications, and adverse events to evaluate the effects of MT in combination with tirofiban treatment compared to MT alone in AIS patients. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be undertaken in this study, and the full analysis set (FAS) population serves as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Tirofiban","Mechanical thrombectomy","Revascularisation","Haemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A prospective, randomized, controlled, open-Label, assessor-blind, multicenter clinical study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Images from each study site will be uploaded to the central server and all analyses will be performed by a trained physician at the study coordinating center who is unaware of group assignments.
