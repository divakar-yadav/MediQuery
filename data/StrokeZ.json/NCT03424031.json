Although commonly used in the rehabilitation of stroke, evidence is still lacking as to its impact in this specific care.\n\nVerticalization is underutilized in two situations: in the hyper acute phase as well as in elderly and very deficient patients. It has, however, been shown that the precocity of the treatment allows a better functional recovery. Similarly, the re-education of the elderly is also debated since it has long been mentioned that age was a factor of poor prognosis, the objectives are sometimes underestimated. However, several studies have shown that with the same rehabilitation, elderly patients recover as much as younger patients. The differences found are at least in part due to \"less rehabilitation\" of older stroke patients.\n\nThe different existing data lead us to the hypothesis that the verticalization of the elderly hemiplegic patient in acute phase would allow a better functional recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Verticalization","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"the patient will be placed in the most vertical position possible.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Verticalization"]},{"label":"Passive mobilization","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Passive mobilization of the lower limb deficit"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Verticalization","description":"To allow the verticalization of hemiplegic patients, we will use a device commonly used in rehabilitation: the standing (or standing) brand Thera Trainer .
