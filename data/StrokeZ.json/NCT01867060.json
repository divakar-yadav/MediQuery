The investigators hypothesise that the PHRM, used intermittently for 3 months, will detect significantly more cases of PAF than the ACER, used continuously for one week.\n\nA case-control sub-study will identify individuals with confirmed PAF, and matched individuals with no evidence of PAF, to identify potential serum biomarkers for PAF.\n\nA further case-control study will assess markers of left atrial function in patients with PAF and their matched controls.\n\nAnother case-control sub-study will determine the significance of frequent Atrial Premature Beats (APBs) in the development of AF over a one year period.","detailedDescription":"Patients with suspected AF will be initially referred to a community-based, nurse-led Arrhythmia clinic by their General Practitioners over a 15-month period.\n\nAll patients will be issued with a one week ACER (the 'R. Test 4 Evolution'), seen as the 'best-practice' investigation for this population group. Participants will also be issued with a PHRM for three months. They will be instructed to take regular twice-daily, 30 second recordings with additional recordings in the event of relevant symptoms. They will return the ACER after one week and the PHRM after 3 months.\n\nA subgroup of participants (target recruitment number = 100) will undergo transthoracic echocardiography. A 40ml venous blood sample will also be taken. Another small subgroup (target recruitment = 20) will be asked to continue twice-daily recordings using the PHRM for a further nine months and will be issued with a repeat one week ACER at study completion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Cardiac monitoring","Biomarkers","Transthoracic echocardiography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":194,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor","type":"OTHER","description":"Automated Cardiac Event Recorder in parallel with Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor.","interventionNames":["Device: Automated Cardiac Event Recorder","Device: Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Automated Cardiac Event Recorder","description":"Automated Cardiac Event Recorder to be worn continuously for one week.","armGroupLabels":["Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor"],"otherNames":["'R.
