Thirty individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Subjects in the experimental group will receive exergame-based balance training, while subjects in the control group will receive upper limb and trunk training. Both groups will undergo a four-week intervention consisting of three sessions per week, each lasting 60 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Turning performance","Balance performance","Exergame","Balance training","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exergame-based balance training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Exergame-based balance training"]},{"label":"Upper limb and trunk training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Upper limb and trunk training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exergame-based balance training","description":"For a four-week intervention consisting of three weekly sessions, each lasting 60 minutes.

The test is conducted in four contexts: context 1 involves standing with eyes open on a firm surface; context 2 involves standing with eyes open on a foam cushion; context 3 involves standing with eyes closed on a firm surface; and context 4 involves standing with eyes closed on a foam cushion.
