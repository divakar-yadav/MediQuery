When the connectivity between those cells is altered or disrupted, the functioning of the brain is impaired. In stroke, the interruption of blood supply to the neural circuits results in connectivity damage and permanent disabilities. Experimental evidence suggests that some types of brain state, including sleep, can protect brain tissue from stroke and \"repair\" the damaged circuits. This project will investigate the neuronal mechanism underlying the protective effect of sleep on brain connectivity and network activity. To this end, the investigators will use a collection of state-of-the-art technologies including high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Perspectives include a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the perturbed electrical activity of the brain during sleep in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemispatial Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Real transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)"]},{"label":"sham TMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a comparison.","interventionNames":["Device: sham Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)"]},{"label":"TMS and tACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Real transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and real transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","Device: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)"]},{"label":"TMS and sham tACS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Real transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and sham transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as a comparison.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","Device: sham Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","description":"The investigators recently showed that the repeated application of the so-called continuous theta burst protocol (cTBS) over the contralesional hemisphere resulted in a long-standing improvement of visual hemineglect (Cazzoli et al., 2012). The cTBS protocol was developed by Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2005) and modified by the investigators' group (Nyffeler et al., 2006). TBS protocol consists of a burst of 3 pulses at a frequency of 30 Hz, repeated at 6 Hz.

The mode of stimulation used in this experiment is identical to previous studies using tACS in sleep ( Marshall et al., 2006; Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2014 ). Stimulation follows a sinusoidal pattern from 0 to 260 Î¼A. This pattern is delivered at 0.75 Hz and is repeated for 225 cycles; a total of 5 minutes of stimulation.
