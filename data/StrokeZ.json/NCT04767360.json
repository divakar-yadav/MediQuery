However, according to former studies neurophysiological measures may also have a predictive value. In the acute phase, the combination of the motor score and SEPs are best predictive of outcome. Neurophysiological measures alone are of limited value in predicting long term outcome. However, predictive accuracy is substantially improved through the combined use of both of these measures and clinical variables.\n\nA four-weeks randomized clinical two-period crossover-design study will be conducted. Each patient will be randomized in a two separate consecutive treatment periods (Parallel Group Design). \"Group A\" will be treated with functional electrical stimulation (FES) and a second \"Gruppe B\" will be treated without FES for two weeks.
