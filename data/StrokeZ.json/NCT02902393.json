However, the efficacy of fibrinolysis is about 50%. Several factors, including the size of thrombus, have been associated with revascularisation efficacy.\n\nThe aim of this prospective study is to evaluate ex vivo the effect of tPA in patients with stroke with thromboelastography and to correlate results with the clinical outcome of patients. Results may predict revascularisation in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Fibrinolysis","tPA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Success of revascularisation","interventionNames":["Biological: Thromboelastography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Thromboelastography","armGroupLabels":["Success of revascularisation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of revascularisation 24 hours after tPA injection using CT scan or MRI","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical evaluation using NIHSS scale","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient (\\> 18 years) with a neurological deficit compatible with a neurovascular pathology eligible for fibrinolysis rtPA and having a proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (segment M1 / M2) or basilar trunk objectified brain imaging (MRI angiography or angio CT).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any patient with major comorbidity, a pathology of hemostasis or anticoagulant treatment (vitamin K antagonist (VKA), direct oral anticoagulant).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study .
