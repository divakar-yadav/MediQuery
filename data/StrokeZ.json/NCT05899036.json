Subject will undergo mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove a clot in the brain which is preventing blood flow), with the RapidPulseTM Aspiration System. Participating in the trial is for 5-7 days or hospital discharge (whichever is earlier).","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this prospective, multi-center, open label study of the RapidPulseTM Aspiration System is to assess the initial technical (performance), effectiveness and safety of the RapidPulseTM Aspiration System as frontline approach for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions identified within 24 hours of symptom onset (or last seen normal). The target sample size is 10 evaluable subjects with a maximum of 50 subjects. Subjects will undergo mechanical thrombectomy procedure and will have postoperative assessments completed at 24 hours and on Day 5-7 or upon hospital discharge. The primary endpoint is first pass reperfusion effect (FPE) as defined by mTICI ≥ 2c after one reperfusion attempt."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Stroke","Large Vessel Occlusion","Mechanical Thrombectomy"],"keywords":["Stroke","Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study to assess the initial technical (performance), effectiveness, and safety of the RapidPulseTM Aspiration System.
