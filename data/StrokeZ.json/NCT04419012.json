An important element of management of patients with AF is anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are two main drugs groups used in thromboembolic events prevention.\n\nPrimary objective of the study is to assess the frequency of VKAs vs NOACs prescription in AF patients treatment of with OACs.\n\nSecondary objective of the study are as follows: assessment of the frequency of appropriate/inappropriate OACs prescription in AF patients and assesment of the number of patients with AF treated with apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban with high thromboembolism risk according to CHA2DS2-VASc score.\n\nThe POL-AF Registry is a multicenter prospective analysis of hospital records of patients with AF managed in ten cardiology centers.\n\nCollected data will include demographics, type of AF (valvular and non-valvular, as well as paroxysmal, persistent and permanent), medical history, laboratory tests, echocardiographic parameters and concomitant medications.\n\nEach patient will be evaluated regarding to common scales assessing risk of thromboembolic (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for bleeding in anticoagulated patients basing on the current guidelines for AF treatment) events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","anticoagulant treatment","apixaban","dabigatran","rivaroxaban","vitamin K antagonist","stroke prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with AF treated with VKA","interventionNames":["Other: observation"]},{"label":"Patients with AF treated with NOAC","interventionNames":["Other: observation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"observation","description":"observation","armGroupLabels":["Patients with AF treated with NOAC","Patients with AF treated with VKA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of the frequency of VKAs vs NOACs prescription in AF patients treatment of with OACs.","description":"Compared data will include: frequency of VKAs vs NOACs prescriptions.","timeFrame":"Through the study completion, an average of 2 months."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of the frequency of appropriate/inappropriate OACs prescription in AF patients.","description":"Compared data will include: demographics, type of AF, medical history, baseline characteristics and concomitant medications.","timeFrame":"Through the study completion, an average of 2 months."},{"measure":"Number of patients with AF treated with apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban with high thromboembolism risk according to CHA2DS2-VASc (heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism, vascular disease and sex) score.","description":"The CHA2DS2-VAS score includes the following factors: heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism, vascular disease and sex.\n\nAccording to the CHA2DS2-VAS score, high thromboembolic risk means 2 points in men, 3 points in women.\n\nData on the components of CHA2DS2-VASC are obtained from medical records.","timeFrame":"Through the study completion, an average of 2 months."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- patients with AF hospitalized in a participating center during study period\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* hospitalisation for atrial fibrillation ablation\n* death during hospitalization","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients with AF hospitalized in a participating center during study period.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Iwona Gorczyca, Md,PhD","affiliation":"Collegium Medicum, Jan Kochanowski University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Iwona Gorczyca","city":"Kielce","zip":"25-525","country":"Poland","geoPoint":{"lat":50.87033,"lon":20.62752}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33708474","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Uzieblo-Zyczkowska B, Krzesinski P, Maciorowska M, Gorczyca I, Jelonek O, Wojcik M, Blaszczyk R, Kaplon-Cieslicka A, Gawalko M, Tokarek T, Rajtar-Salwa R, Bil J, Wojewodzki M, Szpotowicz A, Krzciuk M, Bednarski J, Bakula-Ostalska E, Tomaszuk-Kazberuk A, Szyszkowska A, Welnicki M, Mamcarz A, Wozakowska-Kaplon B.
