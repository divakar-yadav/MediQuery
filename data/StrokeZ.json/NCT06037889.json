BAD is associated with early neurological deterioration and poor prognosis, but is lack of effective therapy. The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by branch atheromatous disease. The main question it aims to answer is: Compared with standard antiplatelet therapy based on current stroke guideline, whether tirofiban used in acute phase of BAD could improve the proportion of excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale: 0-1) at 90 days. Researcher will also compare the rate of major bleeding between treatment and control groups.","detailedDescription":"BRANT study is a multicenter, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint, Parallel controlled trial with the primary null hypothesis that, in patients with acute BAD-related stroke, there is no difference in the proportion of excellent outcome in those treated with intravenous Tirofiban compared with those treated with standard antiplatelet therapy based on guideline when subjects are randomized within 48 hours of stroke onset.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine whether intravenous tirofiban (a loading dose of 0.4ug/kg/min\\*30min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1ug/kg/min\\*47.5h) is effective in increasing the proportion of excellent functional outcome (mR: 0-1) at 90 days, when initiated within 48 hours of onset. The active comparator is standard antiplatelet therapy based on guideline \\[ie, 1) aspirin 150-300 mg qd, OR 2) aspirin 100 mg qd plus clopidogrel 75 mg qd\\] for 48 hours.\n\nPatients with acute BAD-related stroke between 18 and 75 years old, who can be randomized within 48 hours of onset, and meet the BAD Diagnostic Imaging Criteria, will be enrolled. All patients will conduct MRI before randomization.\n\nSubjects will be randomized 1:1 (Tirofiban: Standard antiplatelet therapy). The subjects' eligibility will be assessed by site investigator prior to accessing the Randomization Module, which is generated via the dynamic block randomization method. Only certified and trained personnel can access the randomization website, who will get the information of treatment (ie, Tirofiban or standard antiplatelet therapy) after the subject has be determined eligible.\n\nThe treatment period is 48 hours for both study groups. A total of 516 eligible patients will be enrolled. Each participant will be followed for 90 days from randomization. The primary outcome will be assessed by well-trained senior neurologists blinded to the treatment. All the clinical and safety events will be re-examined by the Clinical Event Committee (CEC), who are blinded during all procedures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Branch Atheromatous Disease"],"keywords":["Branch atheromatous disease","Tirofiban","Stroke","Treatment Outcome","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"multi-center, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint, parallel controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Our study is an open label, blinded endpoint trail.
