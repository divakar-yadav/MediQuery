It appears in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, and spreads worldwide from February 2020. The first cases of infection in France were confirmed on 24 January 2020. As of April 14, 103,573 cases of infection were confirmed, 32,292 hospitalized cases, including 6,730 in intensive care, with 15,729 deaths recorded1. The most affected regions are Ile de France and the Grand Est (in particular the Haut-Rhin department). Containment of the entire French population was introduced on 17 March, with the aim of reducing the spread of the virus and relieving the burden on the health system, particularly the intensive care units.\n\nThis unprecedented health crisis, as well as the social containment measures in themselves, has repercussions on other acute medical pthologies, not directly related to the viral infection. It appears that the number of patients treated for acute stroke has suddenly declined since the beginning of the epidemic.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether it is the incidence of stroke that has declined or simply the proportion of patients presenting within the time frame that allows for treatment in the acute phase (by thrombolysis or thrombectomy)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["STROKE , Acute","Covid-19","SARS-COV-2","Mechanical thrombectomy","Thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Study of the effect of pandemic covid-19 on the management of stroke patients","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patient\n* Stroke Patients\n* Patient who agreed to participate in this study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- Refusal to participate in this study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult stroke patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Rémy BEAUJEUX, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 78 71","email":"remy.beaujeux@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"name":"Saïd CHAYER, PhD, HDR","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 11 66 90","email":"said.chayer@chru-strasbourg.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service de Neuroradiologie Interventionnelle","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Strasbourg","zip":"67091","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Rémy BEAUJEUX, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 78 71","email":"remy.beaujeux@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"name":"Raoul POP, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 78 71","email":"raoul.pop@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"name":"Rémy BEAUJEUX, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Raoul POP, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":48.58392,"lon":7.74553}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000086382","term":"COVID-19"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000011024","term":"Pneumonia, Viral"},{"id":"D000011014","term":"Pneumonia"},{"id":"D000012141","term":"Respiratory Tract Infections"},{"id":"D000007239","term":"Infections"},{"id":"D000014777","term":"Virus Diseases"},{"id":"D000018352","term":"Coronavirus Infections"},{"id":"D000003333","term":"Coronaviridae Infections"},{"id":"D000030341","term":"Nidovirales Infections"},{"id":"D000012327","term":"RNA Virus Infections"},{"id":"D000008171","term":"Lung Diseases"},{"id":"D000012140","term":"Respiratory Tract Diseases"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2562","name":"COVID-19","asFound":"COVID-19","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13594","name":"Pneumonia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13604","name":"Pneumonia, Viral","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9973","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6058","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14668","name":"Respiratory Tract Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17212","name":"Virus Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20180","name":"Coronavirus Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6245","name":"Coronaviridae Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M23375","name":"Nidovirales Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14839","name":"RNA Virus Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10858","name":"Lung Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14667","name":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
