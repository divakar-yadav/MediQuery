About 30% of ischemic stroke patients, 40% of the healthy people over 80 years old, and 60% of intracranial hemorrhage patients have microbleeds. With the development of imaging technology, clinically more and more patients have found microbleeds in the brain. How these patients are treated with antithrombotic drugs is not yet clear and is in urgent need of evidence. There are only a few prospective cohort studies to determine whether antithrombotic therapy increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients with CMBs, but the results are uncertain. More importantly, whether antithrombotic therapy increases the incidence of the emerging CMBs, and whether the change of increased microbleeds is associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage has not been reported."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebral Hemorrhage","anti-thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1875,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"acute ischemic stroke patient","description":"acute ischemic stroke patient acute ischemic stroke patient Patient age ≥18 years .Acute ischemic stroke patient confirmed by imaging(SWI sequence) .Time of onset: within 3 months","interventionNames":["Other: SWI sequence"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"SWI sequence","description":"Acute ischemic stroke patient confirmed by SWI sequence","armGroupLabels":["acute ischemic stroke patient"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"all cerebral bleeding events","description":"incidence of both cerebral microbleeds and intracranial hemorrhage, determined by MRI","timeFrame":"360 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"all cerebral bleeding events","description":"incidence of both cerebral microbleeds and intracranial hemorrhage, determined by MRI","timeFrame":"180 days"},{"measure":"proportion of mRS 0-1.","description":"the minimum and maximum values of modified Rankin Score (mRS) are 0 and 6, respectively; higher score mean a worse outcome","timeFrame":"180、360 days"},{"measure":"proportion of cerebral microbleeds","description":"cerebral microbleeds, determined by MRI","timeFrame":"180 、360 days"},{"measure":"proportion of cerebral hemorrhage","description":"cerebral hemorrhage, determined by MRI","timeFrame":"180、360 days"},{"measure":"the occurence of stroke or other vascular events","timeFrame":"180、360 days"},{"measure":"the occurence of death due to any cause","timeFrame":"180、360 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
