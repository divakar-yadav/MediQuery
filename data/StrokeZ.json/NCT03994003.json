A swift and accurate TIA diagnosis allows starting treatment of the patient adequately and shortly after the event. The shorter the time between the event and treatment onset, the better the outcome. This approach will be an important step forward in TIA diagnosis and management, similarly to acute coronary syndrome as discussed above."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disease, Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"MiRNA will be isolated from whole blood collected in PAXgene tubes (BD/PreAnalytiX, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
