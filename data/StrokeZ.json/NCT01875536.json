It is applied within clinical and in research contexts to determine the disease severity, describe motor recovery, and plan and assess interventions. In the present study, the 33-item of the UL section was employed. The items are rated on 3-point ordinal scale, as follows: 0= unable to perform; 1= partial ability to perform; and 2= near normal ability to perform.
