Vagus nerve stimulation will be performed via GammaCore® device. A total of 60 patients will be randomized to each of 3 different groups; 'standard dose' vagal stimulation, 'high dose' vagal stimulation, and 'sham stimulation' (1:1:1 ratio). Adverse device events, serious adverse device events, and feasibility of vagal nerve stimulation at the setting of acute stroke will be evaluated. The study will be performed in a multi-center fashion among stroke centers within TurkStrokeNet Network."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke","Stroke,
