The Vicon Motion Analysis System will be utilized to track movement using markers on the subject and the Bionic Leg per the UCSF Human Performance Center's routine. Once outfitted with the marker system, patients will be instructed to perform multiple sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers while data is gathered.\n\nThe sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers will be performed using a standard chair, with a seat height not less than 12\" from the floor. The chair will be positioned such that, at sitting rest, each of the subject's feet are positioned on limb-specific force plates (left and right)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Tibion","Bionics","Rehab","Therapy","Robotics","Intention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient Population","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Chronic post-stroke subjects with varied impairment level, who have completed routine rehabilitative physical therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Tibion Bionic Leg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Tibion Bionic Leg","description":"The device is a lightweight, wearable, portable, battery-powered, robotic leg orthosis that provides active assistance and resistance to lower limb movement according to the patient's intent to move.","armGroupLabels":["Patient Population"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Force","description":"Force, in Newtons (N), by limb, as measured by kinematic and kinetic analysis during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers with and without the Tibion Bionic Leg.","timeFrame":"Subject participation in the study is up to one (1) week."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Work","description":"Work, in Joules (J), by limb, as measured by kinematic and kinetic analysis during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers with and without the Tibion Bionic Leg.","timeFrame":"Subject participation in study is up to one (1) week."},{"measure":"Torque","description":"Torque, in Newton-meters (N-m), at the ankle and knee, by limb, as measured by kinematic and kinetic analysis during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers with and without the Tibion Bionic Leg.","timeFrame":"Subject participation is up to one (1) week"},{"measure":"Moment","description":"Moment at the ankle and knee in Newtons (N), by limb, as measured by kinematic and kinetic analysis during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers with and without the Tibion Bionic Leg.","timeFrame":"Subject participation is up to one (1) week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Single ischemic stroke with residual unilateral lower-extremity weakness\n* Chronic post-stroke (\\>12 months since event)\n* Eligible to participate to lower extremity physical therapy\n* Age 30 years or greater\n* Able to ambulate at least 10 meters without therapist assistance\n* Able to ambulate without a leg brace\n* Able to transfer from sitting to standing without physical assistance from a therapist\n* Able to transfer from standing to sitting without physical assistance from a therapist\n* Subject must understand the nature of the study and provide written informed consent prior to enrollment.\n* Subject must be willing and able to attend all study sessions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Medically unstable\n* Age younger than 30 years\n* Subacute post-stroke (\\< 12 months since event)\n* Status-post multiple strokes\n* Status-post traumatic brain injury\n* Not eligible to participate in lower extremity physical therapy\n* Concomitant degenerative neurological conditions\n* Not able to ambulate at least 10 meters without therapist assistance\n* Unable to ambulate without a leg brace\n* Unable to transfer from sitting to standing without physical assistance from a therapist\n* Unable to transfer from standing to sitting without physical assistance from a therapist\n* Unable to follow instructions, complete follow-up, or provide informed consent.\n* Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Joshua G Vose, MD","affiliation":"Tibion Corporation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UCSF Human Performance Center","city":"San Francisco","state":"California","zip":"94158","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.77493,"lon":-122.41942}},{"facility":"Tibion Corporation","city":"Sunnyvale","state":"California","zip":"94085","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.36883,"lon":-122.03635}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"22082495","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Wong CK, Bishop L, Stein J.
