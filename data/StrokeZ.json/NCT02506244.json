this study is to investigate whether it is possible to identify a high-risk cohort suitable for screening for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation using claims data, and then engage those individuals in a

early detection.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to propose to study two different methods of intermittent rhythm monitoring in a cohort of individuals without prior history of
