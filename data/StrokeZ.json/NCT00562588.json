They argue that clinical experience with sub-acute Aggrenox treatment is limited and poorly documented when compared with sub-acute acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment. However, long term treatment (started after 3-6 months after stroke/TIA) with Aggrenox was safe and superior to ASA treatment in preventing recurrent strokes. There is no evidence for ASA to prevent from neurological progression after stroke during the first 3 months. Results from a cohort study suggest that starting Aggrenox within 72 hours after stroke predicts clinical improvement in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at discharge from the hospital. Dipyridamole suppresses acute inflammatory responses to stroke.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of a secondary stroke prevention treatment with Aggrenox when initiated within 24 hours of stroke onset on a stroke unit compared to later initiation after a 7 day ASA treatment and outside off a stroke unit setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":551,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aggrenox bid (ASA 25mg/Dipyridamole ER 200mg)"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"ASA 100 mg qd"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Telephone Modified Rankin Scale (Centralised, Blinded Assessment)","description":"The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.
