The study will recruit for 9 months plus 6 months of follow-up. It will recruited a total of 70 people with stroke (35 for experimental and control group). After providing informed consent, participants will be evaluated on admission, at discharge, at 4 weeks (follow-up visit) and at 6 months (telephone interview). Participants will be psuedo randomized, as the ward will be environmentally enriched during consecutive alternating time frames. The instrument used to measure the multidimensional recovery will be the Stroke Impact Scale. Specific secondary outcomes will assessed the recovery in motor, cognitive and communication function, the impact on physical activity, mood, the type of activity of participants exposed to EE and the impact on the ward organization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["enriched environment","in-patients setting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Longitudinal interventional study in which participants are not randomised, as the experimental design alternates sequentially between the control and experimental groups, with no possibility of interaction between the two groups.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Enriched environment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"35 people with stroke recruited from the in-patient ward of the Neurology Clinic, meeting the inclusion criteria.","interventionNames":["Other: Enriched environment"]},{"label":"No intervention","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"35 people with stroke recruited from the in-patient ward of the Neurology Clinic, meeting the inclusion criteria."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Enriched environment","description":"In the experimental group (enriched environment), assistants will supervise participants sponatneoulsy engaging in activities, including listening to music, drawing, playing cards or board games, exercising the affected upper limb with constructions or puzzles, etc., in the living room and personal rooms.

The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points (possible range 0 to 57).
