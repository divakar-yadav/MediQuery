Vision restoration can be achieved by varies methods including behavioral training and electrical brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) which are able to influence the excitability and activity of cortical areas.\n\nIt is hypothesized that transorbital alternating current stimulation (tACS) can improve the residual field of vision in patients with post-chiasmatic lesions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Complete Hemianopia","Incomplete Hemianopia","Scotoma","Quadrantanopia","Stroke","Hemorrhage","Brain Trauma"],"keywords":["hemianopia","visual field defect","stroke","non-invasive brain stimulation","alternating current stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Verum stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS)","interventionNames":["Device: Verum stimulation"]},{"label":"Placebo stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"compared to verum stimulation the same electrode montage set-up is used during placebo stimulation, except that placebo patients receive a minimal stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: Placebo stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Verum stimulation","description":"10 days (2x 5 working days), daily transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) is applied with a device generating weak current pulses in predetermined firing bursts of 2 to 9 pulses.
