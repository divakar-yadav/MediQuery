In PHYS-STROKE, 215 patients with subacute stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic) receive either 4-weeks of physical training (aerobic training, 5 times a week, for 50 minutes) or 4-weeks of relaxation sessions (5 times a week, for 50 minutes). A convenience sample of 100 of these patients with ischemic stroke will be included in BAPTISe and will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and blood tests before and after the PHYS-STROKE intervention. Imaging scans will address parameters of cerebral perfusion and vessel size imaging. Blood tests will determine several parameters such as immunity, inflammation (including neopterin, MMP-9), metabolism (including ApoCIII, oxidized LDL, HOMA-index, uric acid, CK-MB, cystatin c, and leptin), cytokines (osteopontin, adiponectin), and endothelial function (SDF1-alpha, ADMA, sICAM, sVCAM, E-selectin, P-selectin). Additionally, we will assess the association between functional outcomes (co-primary outcome measures of PHYS-STROKE) and biomarkers including imaging results."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Physical fitness","relaxation","stroke","cerebral ischemia","cerebral perfusion","biomarkers","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Patients will receive blood draws (whole blood) for blood biomarker analyses."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Physical Fitness","description":"Patients from this group underwent 4 weeks of aerobic fitness training additional to normal supportive care, 5 times a week, for 50 minutes"},{"label":"Relaxation","description":"Patients of this group received 4-weeks of relaxation sessions additional to normal supportive care, 5 times a week, for 50 minutes."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral perfusion","description":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based cerebral perfusion are assessed before and after the 4-weeks of physical fitness training.\n\nPrimary and secondary endpoints are specified after completion of the interim analysis after inclusion of the first 24 patients (first stage).
