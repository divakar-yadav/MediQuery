The purpose of splinting is to support, to position, to immobilize, to prevent contracture and deformities, to reduce spasticity and to enhance function. Dynamic lycra splints have been found to improve spasticity, posture, and fluency of upper extremity movements in computerized analysis systems due to the effects of neutral warmth, circumferential pressure and by creating a low intensity prolonged stretch on hypertonic muscles , all of which contribute to increased sensory awareness of the involved limb. These splints are frequently used in the field of neurological rehabilitation, but there is not enough scientific evidence about their efficacy. It was demonstrated that lycra sleeves have positive effects on upper extremity function of children with cerebral palsy. Lycra sleeves for upper extremity function after stroke is a relatively new field of research.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate effects of dynamic lycra orthosis as an adjunct to botulinum toxin-a injection of the upper limb in adults following stroke.","detailedDescription":"Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone resulting from hyper-excitability of the tonic stretch reflex in people with upper motor neurone (UMN) syndrome following damage to the brain or spinal cord. If left untreated, a vicious cycle occurs, in which unopposed contraction (spastic dystonia) in the affected muscle groups leads to an abnormal limb posture, resulting in soft tissue shortening and further biomechanical changes in the contracted muscles. This in turn prevents muscle lengthening and further stiffness. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been shown to provide a sustained reduction in post-stroke upper-limb spasticity when combined with rehabilitation. Although the trial-based evidence for enhanced benefit through a combination of BoNT-A and physical intervention is limited, the benefits of a combined approach are well-accepted in clinical practice. A successful treatment package, often incorporating physical and pharmacological treatments, can improve physical function and can also prevent secondary complications. A recent systematic review concluded that there is an urgent need for large-scale, rigorous clinical trials that investigate the relative efficacy of therapy types as independent or combined interventions with BoNT-A injection.\n\nDynamic lycra splints are proposed to modify hypertonicity due to the effects of neutral warmth, circumferential pressure and by creating a low intensity prolonged stretch on hypertonic muscles, all of which contribute to increased sensory awareness of the involved limb. Lycra arm splints comprise circumferential lycra segments that are orientated to produce a specific 'direction of pull'. Lycra1 arm splints specifically aim to influence hypertonicity, posture and patterns of movement. All of which are expected to result in improved movement performance, particularly fluency or smoothness of movement and to contribute to improved function. It was demonstrated that lycra sleeves have positive effects on upper extremity function of children with cerebral palsy. Lycra sleeves for upper extremity function after stroke is a relatively new field of research. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of dynamic lycra orthosis as an adjunct to botulinum toxin-a injection of the upper limb in adults following stroke.\n\nPatients with stroke for more than three months and who are in need for botulinum toxin injection for post-stroke upper limb spasticity will be randomized to two groups: Lycra sleeve plus rehabilitation and only rehabilitation groups. After botulinum toxin injection, both groups will receive rehabilitation program including passive, active and active assistive range of motion and stretching exercises for shoulder, elbow, wrist, facilitation and inhibition techniques, neuromuscular electrical stimulation for wrist extensors, strengthening exercises for affected upper extremity, occupational therapy for two hours a day, five days a week for three weeks. Intervention group will wear lycra sleeve for eight hours a day, five days a week for three weeks. Effects of lycra sleeves as an adjunct to rehabilitation program after botulinum toxin injection will be assessed by using Fugl Meyer Upper Limb Motor score and Motricity index for motor function, Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity, Box and Block test score for hand dexterity, Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for sensory functions. Outcome assessment will be undertaken by a blinded assessor at before treatment, after treatment (at 3 weeks) and after three months.\n\nFriedman test will be used to establish within group changes over time in outcome variables. Wilcoxon's signed-rank test will be performed to show differences in the parameters between baseline and follow-up points. Between groups differences will be analyzed by using Mann-Whitney U test. Results will be considered significant when P \\< 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke","Upper Limb Hypertonia"],"keywords":["stroke","spasticity","lycra","orthosis","splint","treatment","upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Paralel group randomized controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"outcome assessor blinded to participants' allocated group","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lycra sleeve after botulinum toxin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"8 hours a day lycra sleeve wear plus rehabilitation (for five days a week for three weeks) after botulinum toxin injection for post-stroke spasticity","interventionNames":["Other: Lycra sleeve","Other: Rehabilitation","Drug: Botulinum Toxin"]},{"label":"Rehabilitation after botulinum toxin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Rehabilitation (five days a week for three weeks) after botulinum toxin injection for post-stroke spasticity","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation","Drug: Botulinum Toxin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Lycra sleeve","description":"custom-fitted lycra sleeve extending from axilla to wrist","armGroupLabels":["Lycra sleeve after botulinum toxin"],"otherNames":["Rehabilitation after botulinum toxin injection"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation","description":"Passive, active and active assistive range of motion and stretching exercises for shoulder, elbow, wrist, facilitation and inhibition techniques, neuromuscular electrical stimulation for wrist extensors, strengthening exercises for affected upper extremity, occupational therapy","armGroupLabels":["Lycra sleeve after botulinum toxin","Rehabilitation after botulinum toxin"],"otherNames":["botulinum toxin injection for post stroke spasticity"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum Toxin","description":"Botulinum toxin injection for upper limb spasticity after stroke","armGroupLabels":["Lycra sleeve after botulinum toxin","Rehabilitation after botulinum toxin"],"otherNames":["botulinum toxin injection for post stroke spasticity"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Assessment Scale","description":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment assesses motor impairment in the upper extremities.
