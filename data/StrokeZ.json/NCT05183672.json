Currently, the applicability of the clinics has been further limited by the emergence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic due to restrictions on visits to the clinics and tightened social distancing requirements. Telecare consultations may be a viable option for contributing more flexible, interactive, and cost-efficient care models to support stroke survivors over the longer run. The present study takes advantage of this opportunity by utilizing implementation science to simultaneously implement and evaluate a telecare model of care in a nurse-led post-acute stroke clinic."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","telecare consultation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":196,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive three tertiary stroke care consultations provided by stroke nurses via telecare in 3 months.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Telecare consultation"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive three usual face-to-face consultations provided by stroke nurses in 3 months","interventionNames":["Procedure: Usual face-to-face consultation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Telecare consultation","description":"Using Zoom to communicate with patients","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Usual face-to-face consultation","description":"Face-to-face communication with patients","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Chang in Degree of disability after stroke","description":"Simplified modified Rankin scale will be used to measure the degree of disability for stroke patients.

It includes physical and mental health.","description":"Quality of life will be measured using the Hong Kong version of EuroQol 5-dimension. The scale has five subdomains, which include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Since the scale has 5 items, each digit in the five digit codes refers to the status of each dimension, ranging from 1 for no problem, to 5 for sever problem.
