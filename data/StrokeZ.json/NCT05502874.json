However, the risk factors of early neurological deterioration (END), such as biochemical parameters, neuroimaging, and systemic complications, are not well documented in primary ICH, and the effective predictors of END is unknown.\n\nThis multicenter observational study aims to seek out the risk factors of END in patients with primary ICH and to investigate the association between END and outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Neurologic Deficits","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Neurological
