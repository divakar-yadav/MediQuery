Some researchers found that hTK gene delivery can inhibit the formation of neointimal induced by the common carotid artery ligation in mice. Further study revealed hTK gene transfection in VSMC lead to increased secretion of TK and inhibition of VSMC proliferation. In addition, it was also observed that the serum TK levels were coincident with the carotid artery stenosis. The more severe the stenosis is, the higher the serum TK level is, and the serum TK decreased after carotid artery angioplasty and stent placement. These results suggest that KKS play an important regulatory role in vascular remodeling and TK may exert a beneficial influence in the process of ISR"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disease"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke; in-stent restenosis; tissue kallikrein;","the middle cerebral artery; atherosclerotic stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":99,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tissue kallikrein group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this group will be prescribed with intravenous infusion of TK (0.15 PNAU/d, dissolved in 100ml saline) for 7 days after stenting and then oral administration of pancreatic kallikrein enteric-coated tablet (240U, 3/d) to the end of study.
