Stroke survivors can suffer several neurological impairments and deficits which have an important impact on patient's quality of life and which increase the costs for health and social services. After stroke, impairments in ADLs and functional status, deterioration in health related quality of life can be seen.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to Determine the effect of high intensity speed based treadmill training on Balance, Walking capacity and quality of life in sub-acute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular accident","Aerobic exercise","High intensity interval training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HIIT+CT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"HIIT combined with conventional rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Other: Exercise Therapy","Other: conventional therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional therapy","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional rehabilitation will be provided to this group of patients.","interventionNames":["Other: conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exercise Therapy","description":"High intensity speed based interval treadmill training","armGroupLabels":["HIIT+CT"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional therapy","description":"conventional physical therapy","armGroupLabels":["Conventional therapy","HIIT+CT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 minute walk test","description":"To determine the endurance after stroke","timeFrame":"6 weeks of training"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance scale","description":"It is used to measure the Balance and stability of patient.
