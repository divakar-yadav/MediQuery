A 10% increase will be expected to avoid possible drop-outs.\n\nAssessment scales:\n\nEligibility scale: NIHSS score ≥ 8. Outcome scales: modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 3 months Cutoff scores for mRS will be 0-2 as a cut-off point for a good outcome and 3-6 for a bad outcome.\n\nAlso, a record of all the side effects will be done.
