The aim of the study is to examine the difference in the treatment effects among the combination of task-oriented training with either rhythmic-based training with immersive mirror visual feedback, or mirror therapy on the upper extremity function and brain activity of the stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Virtual Reality","Mirror Movement Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror therapy using a mirror box","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"30 minutes' exercise of mirror therapy followed by 20 minutes' task-oriented training","interventionNames":["Device: Mirror therapy","Other: Task-oriented training"]},{"label":"Virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"30 minutes' activity of virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training followed by 20 minutes' task-oriented training","interventionNames":["Device: Virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training","Other: Task-oriented training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Mirror therapy","description":"30 minutes' mirror therapy included movements of forearm, wrist, fingers and thumb, as well as a tendon gliding exercise of less-affected upper extremity using a mirror box","armGroupLabels":["Mirror therapy using a mirror box"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training","description":"30 minutes' virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training included musical exercises involving virtual drums playing with less-affected upper extremity, and synchronized virtual drums playing and singing activity","armGroupLabels":["Virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Task-oriented training","description":"20 minutes' motor training targeted to goals that are relevant to the functional needs of the patient","armGroupLabels":["Mirror therapy using a mirror box","Virtual reality-based mirror therapy with rhythmic skill training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the result of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for motor function of upper extremity test","description":"Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed).
