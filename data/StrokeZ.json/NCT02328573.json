Forty post-stroke patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: the first group of 20 stroke survivors and their caregivers (up to 40 total participants) will receive 6 months (approximately 24 sessions) of music therapy. The second control groups of 20 stroke survivors and their caregivers will receive standard post-stroke care.\n\nAll enrolled participants will be assessed on their mood, past music experience and music genre preference (music therapy assessment). They will complete the abridged Beck (BDI-2-fastscreen) questionnaire, the stoke and aphasia quality of life scale; a Likert which measures distress; the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB); the NIH Stroke Scale (SS); the Figely compassion scale; and the driving scene test (Stern and White); and the Rankin. In additional we will take saliva samples from all participants to measure hormone levels.\n\nParticipants can attend zoom or live."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke and Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Communal singing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the study group will join the choir and participate in a weekly hour rehearsal for six months and will be assessed for aphasia, mood, and quality of life outcomes","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Communal singing"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group will not participate in the choir for the first six months.
