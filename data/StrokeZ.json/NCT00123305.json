Clinical outcome will also be assessed at 7days, 30 days and 90 days post-treatment. At each of these visits, mortality and neurological assessments (NIHSS, Barthel index, mRankin scale) will be performed. In addition, vital status will be assessed vial a telephone contact at 60 days post-treatment.\n\nThe trial will investigate three dose regimens of microplasmin, all of which are within the range of doses previously evaluated in a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers; the planned sample size for the trial is approximately 40 patients.\n\nThe study will consist of 3 phases - the Baseline, In-hospital Phase and Follow up Phase. Baseline is from study entry through randomisation; the In-hospital phase is from treatment with study drug through hospital discharge or day 7, whichever occurs first. The follow up phase consists of visits to the hospital 30 days (+ 3 days) from the day of study drug administration. Hospital discharge is defined as the end of the discharge from the acute hospital setting. Discharge may be to home, to a rehabilitation setting or to a non-acute hospital setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Microplasmin"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Microplasmin"]},{"label":"3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Microplasmin"]},{"label":"4","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Microplasmin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Microplasmin","description":"1mg/kg bolus of microplasmin solution followed by 1,2 or 3mg/kg infusion of mircroplasmin solution.","armGroupLabels":["1","2","3"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Microplasmin","description":"1mg/kg bolus of placebo solution followed by 1,2 or 3mg/kg infusion of placebo solution","armGroupLabels":["4"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intracranial haemorrhage","timeFrame":"24 hours and Day-7"},{"measure":"Change from Baseline in NIHSS","timeFrame":"Day7 and Day-90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel Index and modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"Day-90"},{"measure":"Markers of systemic lysis","timeFrame":"Baseline, end of treatment, 6, 12, 24, 72 and 96 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke with onset within 12 hours before randomization with baseline NIHSS \\> 6 and \\< 22\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nGeneral Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Participation in another study with an investigational drug or device within the previous 30 days, prior participation in the present study, or planned participation in another trial within the time frame of the current trial\n* Symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if CT scan or MRI is negative for hemorrhage\n* Women known to be pregnant, lactating, or having a positive or indeterminate pregnancy test\n\nStroke Related Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Neurological deficit that has led to stupor or coma (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \\[NIHSS\\] Level Of Consciousness Item 1a score \\>or=2)\n* High clinical suspicion of septic embolus\n* Thrombosis involving cerebral veins\n* Rapidly improving neurological signs at any time before initiation of study drug administration\n\nImaging Related Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Hemorrhagic transformation or intracerebral hemorrhage observed on baseline CT of the brain or gradient recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging\n* CT or MRI evidence of nonvascular cause for the neurological symptoms\n* Large hypodensity on CT involving \\> 1/3 of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory\n* Baseline DWI volume \\> 1/3 of the MCA territory\n* Signs of mass effect causing shift of midline structures on CT or MRI\n* Unable to undergo MRI (i.e., ferrous implants, cardiac pacemakers, agitation, claustrophobia or known sensitivity to MRI contrast agents)\n\nSafety Related Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Congenital or acquired coagulopathy causing either of the following\n\n  1. activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation greater than 2 seconds above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for local laboratory\n  2.
