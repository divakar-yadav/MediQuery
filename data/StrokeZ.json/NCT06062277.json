All blood samples will be analysed for a panel of inflammatory blood markers and the change in blood inflammatory markers from baseline to end of treatment will be calculated.","detailedDescription":"Patients with a history of stroke or TIA, atherosclerosis and hsCRP≥2mg/L at baseline will be eligible for inclusion. Participants ≥18 years and ≤90 years, with no race, ethnicity or sex exclusions will be recruited. The target sample size is 91 participants. The sample size was calculated based on a paired two-sided t-test, using a 33% effect size, setting alpha at 0.05 and power at 0.8, and allowing for up to 20% non-adherence with colchicine.\n\nParticipants will receive 30 days treatment with pleiotropic anti-inflammatory agent colchicine 0.5mg tablets orally once daily for 30 days. A panel of blood inflammatory markers will be drawn pre and post treatment. Outcomes will be the calculated change in blood inflammatory marker panel, including hsCRP and IL-6, comparing before treatment levels with after treatment levels. This is a before and after paired cohort study, each participant will act as their own control.\n\nAll participants will receive the intervention study medication, colchicine 0.5mg orally once daily. Medication adherence will be ascertained by pill count and tolerability assessed using the MAQ questionnaire. MAQ questionnaire is a 6 item questionnaire which will assess each participants perception of the convenience, taste, look and smell, effect, side-effects and overall acceptability of the study drug, colchicine, on a likert scale.\n\nBaseline characteristics will be collected including participant demographics, past medical history, medication use, blood pressure, BMI. These assessments will be repeated at the follow-up visit. This information will be collected with participant consent via participant reported history, physical exam, office blood pressure and weight measurement, and with reference to medical notes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["hsCRP","ischaemic stroke","atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Before and after intervention paired cohort study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":91,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single Arm Study","type":"OTHER","description":"Paired cohort before and after study.
