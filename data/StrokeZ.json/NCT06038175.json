This study will evaluate the implementation of the device, consistency with current diagnostic standards, unnecessary administration of antithrombolytics and will further study the reduction in hospital admissions and overall healthcare costs.","detailedDescription":"In the proposed study, subjects admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms of dizziness, concerning for an acute ischemic stroke, will undergo routine triage (bedside neurologic examination, head impulse testing, CT scan) and will then be tested with a vHIT device to attempt to further identify the cause of dizziness, after standard of care testing has been performed.
