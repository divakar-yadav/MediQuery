Recent evidence suggests that CBD has multiple, beneficial, effects in patients (such as those with SWS that undergo neurological deterioration) suffering from medically refractory seizures. We hypothesize that CBD will reduce seizure frequency in children and young adults with SWS and will therefore help stabilize and improve their neurologic status.This trial is part of an expanded access program, available through a partnership with GW Pharmaceutical, which has been sanctioned by the FDA to study the safety and efficacy of Epidiolex (cannabidiol/CBD) in participants with SWS and medically refractory seizures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sturge-Weber Syndrome"],"keywords":["Sturge-Weber syndrome","SWS","Drug resistant epilepsy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cannabidiol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All subjects will receive the experimental Epidiolex (cannabidiol) oral solution to be taken at home twice a day, and will be treated on an outpatient basis.

The determination of whether to re-enroll will be made by the PI and sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Re-enrollment can occur no earlier than 4 weeks after the final, post-weaning follow-up visit under the old subject ID.\n\nWritten informed consent obtained from the patient or the patient's legal representative must be obtained prior to beginning treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with seizures secondary to metabolic, toxic, infectious or psychogenic disorder or drug abuse or current seizures related to an acute medical illness.\n* Presence of only non-motor partial seizures (without limb or facial movements, eye deviation or head turning)\n* Patients who require rescue medication during the Baseline phase for more than 6 days.\n* Patients with any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions at randomization such as:\n\n  1. liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and chronic hepatitis \\[i.e. quantifiable hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA and/or positive HbsAg, quantifiable hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA\\]\n  2.
