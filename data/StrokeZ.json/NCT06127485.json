However, there are no studies on the efficacy of the method in the recovery of the upper limb and the improvement of autonomy after stroke.\n\nMethods: Randomized double-blind clinical trial with patients with stroke in semi-acute period, randomized into experimental group (EG) (conventional rehabilitation and Pilates) or control group (CG) (conventional rehabilitation).\n\nAfter randomization and initial evaluation, the intervention will begin (2 sessions per week, 3 months). After completion, there will be post-intervention assessment, and another one at 1 month.\n\nIntervention: The CG will receive 30 minutes of physical therapy and 30 minutes of occupational therapy. The SG will receive 20 minutes of physiotherapy, 20 minutes of occupational therapy and 20 minutes of Pilates.\n\nAssessment instruments: Mean Functional Independence; Functional Range Test; Timed 'Up and Go'; Nine Hole Peg Test; Box and Block Test; Arm, Shoulder and Hand Disabilities Questionnaire; Client Satisfaction Questionnaire."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Occupational Therapy","Physiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The treatment received is a combination of physiotherapy and conventional occupational therapy sessions two days a week, with a duration of 60 minutes divided into 30 minutes of physiotherapy and 30 minutes of occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy conventional"]},{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group received 60 minutes of conventional rehabilitation combined with the Pilates Method, divided into 20 minutes of physiotherapy, 20 minutes of occupational therapy and 20 minutes of Pilates Method.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Neuropilates+occupational therapy and physiotherapy conventional"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Neuropilates+occupational therapy and physiotherapy conventional","description":"Participants assigned to the experimental group received 60 minutes of conventional rehabilitation combined with the Pilates Method, divided into 20 minutes of physical therapy, 20 minutes of occupational therapy and 20 minutes of Pilates Method.

In a relaxed standing position, with feet at hip level, the person is instructed to make a shoulder flexion to 90 degrees and keep the hand extended. The person has to go forward as far as he/she can. The examiner records the final measurement that they manage to shift their center of gravity. Two practice trials and three recorded trials are completed, and the average is the overall mean score. This test is recorded in centimeters.","timeFrame":"pre-intervention (baseline); post-intervention (immediately after the intervention) and follow up (one month after the intervention)"},{"measure":"Timed 'Up and Go' (TUG)","description":"A test that measures the time it takes a person to get up from a chair, walk a distance of 3 meters, turn, return to the chair and sit down.

The answers are coded from 1-4, the total score of the questionnaire being 32 points, with higher values indicating greater satisfaction with the treatment received. In its adaptation to Spanish, it presents adequate psychometric properties and maintains the properties of the initial questionnaire.
