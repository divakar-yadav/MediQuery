These trials demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of endovascular intervention using clot retrieval devices in participants with acute ischemic stroke and large core infarcts. However, the rate of participants achieving a good recovery remains low, while the mortality and disability rates are very high.\n\nMoreover, in Vietnam, the acute stroke treatment process has not been optimized, and the facilities and equipment for monitoring neurointensive care are not fully equipped. As a result, endovascular intervention using clot retrieval devices in participants with large core infarcts has not been widely implemented in the investigator's country, and the effectiveness and safety of this treatment method have not been clearly evaluated.\n\nAddressing this issue is crucial for improving the quality of life and reducing the mortality and disability rates caused by stroke in this participant group. This study aims to provide new insights into the use of endovascular intervention for treating acute ischemic stroke with a large core infarct volume, thereby supporting clinical decision-making and improving treatment outcomes for participants with acute ischemic stroke and large core infarcts.\n\nWe hypothesize that core infarction is not the sole factor for excluding patients from potent thrombectomy therapy. We aim to determine predictors of favorable and unfavorable outcomes following thrombectomy in patients with large core strokes. Secondly, we aim to build a multivariable calculator to predict good or poor outcomes after thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["large core","Low ASPECTS","Endovascular treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Good outcome","description":"mRS of 0-3; mRS of 0-2","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular treatment"]},{"label":"Unfavorable outcomes","description":"mRS of 4-6","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular treatment","description":"This procedure is instrumental in restoring cerebral blood flow by addressing the clot-induced obstruction within brain-supplying blood vessels.","armGroupLabels":["Good outcome","Unfavorable outcomes"],"otherNames":["Mechanical thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-3","description":"The rate of independent ambulation (mRS 0-3).
