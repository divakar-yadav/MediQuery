According to the comprehensive standardized prevalence estimation in 2016, 12.42 million people older than 40 years in China are currently suffering from stroke or have ever suffered from stroke. The overall prevalence rate of stroke in China was 1,596 per 100,000 people in 2016, 4.6 times higher than the rate of 345.1 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 70% of the survivors have disabilities in varying degrees. In addition to rehabilitation therapy, there is no therapeutic drugs of remarkable curative effect for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. The latest data show that the annual recurrence rate of ischemic stroke in China is as high as 17.7%.\n\nAllogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in many clinical studies for different diseases. In addition to differentiating into multiple cell types and promoting the recovery and repair of the brain by replacing damaged cells, mesenchymal stem cells also secrete cytokines and neurotrophic factors to support and stimulate the growth of other endogenous cells. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. These characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells provide a new therapy for the treatment of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
