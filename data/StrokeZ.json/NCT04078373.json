Patients without and with urinary disorders will be compared, and treatment outcome will be assessed among the latter.","detailedDescription":"This prospective observational study will include 100 patients after first ischaemic or hemorrhagic stroke directly transferred from an acute hospital to our Institute for inpatient rehabilitation. Within admission assessment, patients will be classified according to stroke type, stroke localisation and time since stroke. Comorbidities will be recorded and associated neurological deficits will be assessed. Post mictional residue will be determined in all patients one day after admission. The patients with urinary disorders will be treated according to the published official protocol, either using the immediate urination approach or the bladder diary approach. Continence will be regularly assessed by the nursing staff. Urination-disorder-related complications (pressure ulcers, falls and urinary infections), drug therapy and the use of continence aids will also be followed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Urinary Incontinence"],"keywords":["stroke","inpatient rehabilitation","urinary
