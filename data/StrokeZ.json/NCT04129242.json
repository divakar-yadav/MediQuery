This stimulation will be delivered concurrently with upper limb motor rehabilitation training (3 days/week for 4 weeks) in chronic stroke patients. Patients will undergo a series of baseline assessments (including a brain scan), a 4-week course of motor rehabilitation, and post-assessments (including a second brain scan)","detailedDescription":"This study aims to refine and develop closed loop taVNS, establish activity with key biomarkers, and show initial feasibility in a small clinical trial. For paired taVNS to succeed as a clinical treatment, it is critical to develop and refine a closed-loop taVNS platform that delivers stimulation concurrently during specific movements of the motor rehabilitation training.\n\nAim 1 develops this novel motion-gated closed-loop system that delivers taVNS in synchrony with specific upper limb motor activation (n=5) Aim 2 will combine the development of the closed-loop system with the investigator's mechanistic understanding to explore an open-label pilot trial (n=20) using closed-loop taVNS paired with task-specific training to determine the feasibility, safety, and potential effect size of this novel combination therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Vagus Nerve Stimulation","Brain Stimulation","Occupational Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"\"paired\" taVNS + Task Specific Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) + Task Specifc Training"]},{"label":"\"unpaired\" taVNS + Task Specific Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) + Task Specifc Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) + Task Specifc Training","description":"A closed-loop taVNS system that delivers taVNS with upper-limb rehabilitation training in a chronic stroke population.","armGroupLabels":["\"paired\" taVNS + Task Specific Training","\"unpaired\" taVNS + Task Specific Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) is a stroke rehabilitation assessment of arm/hand movement impairment.
