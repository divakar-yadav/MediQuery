Interventions The participants will be randomly assigned into two experiment groups (enhanced upper extremity program; and enhanced lower-extremity program).\n\nBoth groups receive routine rehabilitation including daily 50 mins of physical therapy and 50 mins of occupational therapy.\n\nThe enhanced upper extremity program group receives additional daily 50 mins program focusing on training of the hemiplegic upper extremity, while the enhanced lower-extremity program group receives additional daily 50 mins program focusing on training of the hemiplegic lower extremity. The participants receive 20-day training over a 4-week period. The additional program is designed to be specific to either upper-extremity or lower-extremity.
