However, few studies have been done in participants with acute cerebral infarction. In this study, the investigators want to see the effect of tDCS in acute cerebral infarction. the investigators perform tDCS in participants with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours after stroke onset and the investigators measure motor weakness and function at early phase as well as at 3 months.","detailedDescription":"Cerebral infarction is a major cause of death, a disease that is socially and nationally burdensome, leaving disabilities and dementia behind.\n\nIn participants with cerebral infarction, non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS) such as transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) has been reported to be effective in improving motor performance and safe. However, few studies have been done in participants with acute cerebral infarction, and previous studies in participants with acute cerebral infarction have not verified the effect in mild cerebral infarction, and previous studies in acute cerebral infarction mainly stimulate lesions to anode. So in this study, the investigators want to see the effect of stimulating tDCS to both hemispheres in acute cerebral infarction against this backdrop.\n\nStudy Objective: To see if tDCS is effective in improving motor paralysis in participants with acute cerebral infarction.\n\nExpected effectiveness: stability of tDCS has already been demonstrated in many studies. Since tDCS itself is a non-invasive treatment, if the efficacy of the tDCS prove to be effective in patients with acute cerebral infarction, it can be widely implemented without significant risk to many patients.\n\nIntervention : In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators perform tDCS in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours after stroke onset with sham control.\n\nOutcome : the investigators measure motor weakness and function at early phase as well as at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Double blinded randomized control trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blinded randomized control trial","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":172,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"tDCS stimulation\n\n* affected side :\n\n  1. primary motor cortex (M1 cortex by using the C3 or C4 position of the 10-20 EEG system)\n  2. 2mA anode (+) for 30 minutes total 10 times for 7 days (ex) twice a day for 5 days)\n* contralateral unaffected side\n\n  1. primary motor cortex (M1 cortex by using the C3 or C4 position of the 10-20 EEG system)\n  2. 2mA cathode (-) for 30 minutes total 10 times for 7 days (ex) twice a day for 5 days)","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":".
