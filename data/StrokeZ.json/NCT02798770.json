In Switzerland, the approved time window for stroke treatment with intravenous thrombolysis after symptom onset is 4.5 h. Even within the 4.5 h time-window, however, the benefit of treatment strongly decreases as time passes.\n\nMoreover, only around 10% patients receive thrombolytic treatment, since patients with stroke arrive too late to the hospital (prehospital delay). Despite efforts to educate the community on the symptom of stroke, prehospital delay did not decrease over time, and the reasons remain incompletely understood. Prehospital delay reduces the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke treated with thrombolysis, and reduces the odds of favorable outcome among the minority treated with thrombolysis.\n\nThis prospective cohort study aims at understanding the causes of prehospital delay among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Trained study-nurses will interview, at the bedside, patients and proxies along a standardized questionnaire on prehospital delay. Avoiding modificables causes of prehospital delay may increase the thrombolysis rate and improve outcomes after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":337,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Center Basel","interventionNames":["Other: No Intervention Foreseen"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No Intervention Foreseen","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Center Basel"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prehospital Delay between between Stroke Onset and Admission to the Hospital as assessed by In-Person Interview","description":"Prehospital delay will be assessed by asking the Patient or witnesses how long the time interval between stroke onset and Hospital Admission is.
