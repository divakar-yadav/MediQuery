Ischemic stroke with limited hemorrhagic conversion (i.e., petechial hemorrhage or micro-hemorrhage) is acceptable.\n* Severe or total sensory loss\n* Moderate to severe aphasia and/or severe language deficits\n* Excessive spasticity in the affected elbow or change in oral spasticity treatment drugs within 2 weeks before the Screening Visit\n* Prior botulinum toxin injection to any portion of the affected arm in the prior 3 months before the Screening Visit\n* Major and active neurological, psychiatric, or medical diagnosis that is not adequately controlled and would likely reduce the safety of study participation or impact the subject's ability to comply with study protocol procedures in the opinion of the Investigator\n* Any suicidal ideation during the subject's lifetime at any time prior to randomization including childhood (based on subject history), equivalent to type 2 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)\n* Received an investigational pharmacotherapy therapy within the past 3 months\n* Heavy use of any tobacco-smoke emitting products (including but not limited to cigarettes, pipes, and cigars) within 30 days of Baseline.\n* Pregnant or lactating
