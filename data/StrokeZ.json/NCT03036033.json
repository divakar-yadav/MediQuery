It assists the hand to open, which is crucial for people to grasp, and release everyday objects. It may improve function by doing this but may also help people with severe weakness take part more fully in therapy sessions. This glove is already marketed and is being used in some NHS sites. This trial will assess how it could be used in NHS practice in acute stroke patients and will develop a plan to implement this."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Vascular Disorder","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single group, open feasibility study of use of a CE marked and available device.","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SaeboGlove Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will be given a SaeboGlove for a 4-week period to use along side their routine functional based training program.","interventionNames":["Device: SaeboGlove"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SaeboGlove","description":"All participants are given a Saebo glove to use during their stroke recovery.","armGroupLabels":["SaeboGlove Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of sessions performed using the SaeboGlove","description":"Feasibility","timeFrame":"One month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Therapy Intensity","description":"Number of movement repetitions performed using the SaeboGlove","timeFrame":"Cumulative over one month"},{"measure":"Participant, Carer and Therapist Usability and Training Questionnaire","description":"Bespoke questionnaire","timeFrame":"One month"},{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"Measure to assess gross dexterity","timeFrame":"One month"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","description":"Measure to assess arm function","timeFrame":"One month"},{"measure":"Motor Activity Log (MAL)","description":"Interview intended to examine how much and how well the participant uses arm","timeFrame":"One month"},{"measure":"Number of adverse events related to using the SaeboGlove","description":"Safety","timeFrame":"One month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
