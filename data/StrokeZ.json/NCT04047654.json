Patients were recruited from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. The efficacy outcome was early recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 90 days after initiation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). The safety outcome were major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding complications in 180 days. Continuous variables were compared using independent t test and MannWhitney U test, and categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, hazard ratios and P values were calculated by the use of multivariable Cox's regression analysis.","detailedDescription":"This is a retrospective cohort study of Thai octogenarians with NVAF. Patients who were prescribed with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban or warfarin from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018 were recruited. The primary efficacy was recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA in 90 days after initiating OACs. The secondary efficacy were recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA in 180 days after initiating OACs. While any bleeding complications were defied as primary safety outcomes. Continuous variables were compared using independent t test and MannWhitney U test, and categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["anticoagulant drugs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":327,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs)","description":"Patients who were prescribed with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban for stroke secondary prevention.","interventionNames":["Drug: Non vitamin K oral anticoagulants"]},{"label":"Warfarin","description":"Patients who were prescribed with warfarin for stroke secondary prevention."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Non vitamin K oral anticoagulants","description":"Non vitamin K oral anticoagulants are apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban","armGroupLabels":["Non vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate recurrence of stroke or TIA in 90 days","description":"Rate recurrence of stroke or TIA in 90 days after initiation of OACs","timeFrame":"90 days after initiation of OACs"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate recurrence of stroke or TIA in 180 days","description":"Rate recurrence of stroke or TIA in 180 days after initiation of OACs","timeFrame":"180 days after initiation of OACs"},{"measure":"Rate of major bleeding","description":"Rate of major bleeding in 90 days and 180 days after initiation of OACs","timeFrame":"180 days after initiation of OACs"},{"measure":"Rate of clinically relevant non-major bleeding","description":"Rate of clinically relevant non-major bleeding in 90 days and 180 days after initiation of OACs","timeFrame":"180 days after initiation of OACs"},{"measure":"Patients's baseline characteristics associated with recurrence of stroke or TIA as assessed by multivariate cohort analysis","description":"Patients's baseline characteristics associated with recurrence of stroke or TIA in 180 days after initiation of OACs as assessed by multivariate cohort analysis","timeFrame":"180 days after initiation of OACs"},{"measure":"Patients's baseline characteristics associated with major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding as assessed by multivariate cohort analysis","description":"Patients's baseline characteristics associated with major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding in 180 days as assessed by multivariate cohort analysis","timeFrame":"180 days after initiation of OACs"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age more than 80 years old\n* Patients who were diagnosed with I48, I63 or G45 from International Classification of Diseases 10th version (ICD-10).
