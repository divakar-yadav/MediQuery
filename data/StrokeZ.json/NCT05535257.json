Researchers want to expand on this with a more advanced stimulation but in a device that is already routinely used. The SCD is normally used to prevent blood clots. It uses pressure to keep blood moving in the leg. It is routinely used in hospitals across the country. While it does this it warms and even vibrates the leg giving many types of stimulation to the limb and to the brain. This stimulation may help improve recovery further, at marginal cost, while possibly reducing the chances of blood clots in an immobile limb."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Weakness","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sequential Compression Device (SCD) on upper extremity","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects post stroke with upper extremity weakness have the SCD sleeve placed on the arm for up to 4 hours for one day only","interventionNames":["Device: Sequential Compression Device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sequential Compression Device","description":"Calf size lower extremity sequential compression device sleeve will be placed on the weak upper extremity blow the cubital fossa and may include the hand if necessary.
