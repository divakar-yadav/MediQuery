Approximately 100 patients will be recruited over the 24-month period with Acute Brain Injury (trauma brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke), who in their acute phase of intensive care unit require placement of a catheter capable of monitoring intracranial pressure (intra parenchymal catheter or external ventricular shunt). In addition to all the intensive care provided by the most recent guidelines, patients will undergo measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter through ultrasonography. At least, three measurements will be performed within the first 3 hours after admission, within the first 24-48 hours, and at each invasive intracranial pressure value greater than 18 cmH2O. Those patients with intracranial pressure values greater than 35 mmHg. At the first intracranial pressure measurement, patients with eyeball disease or trauma will be excluded. Measurements will be performed following the CLOSED bundle.\n\nAnalysis of the results will include correlation between the invasive pressure values and the mean value of optic nerve sheath diameter measurements in the two projections (sagittal and transverse). In addition, the correlation of the absolute value of invasive pressure detected with the ratio of the optic nerve sheath diameter measurement to the eyeball diameter measured always ultrasound will be sought."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intra Cerebral Hemorrhage","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Aneurysmal","Trauma, Brain","Hypertension Intracranial","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["optic nerve sheath diameter","ultrasonography","Hypertension Intracranial","neuro monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"acute brain injury","description":"Intra Cerebral Hemorrhage Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Aneurysmal Trauma, Brain Stroke, Ischemic","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: ultrasound optic nerve sheath diameter assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"ultrasound optic nerve sheath diameter assessment","description":"ultrasound optic nerve sheath diameter assessment","armGroupLabels":["acute brain injury"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"correlation between invasive ICP/ONSD","description":"correlation between invasive intra-cranial pression assessment and ultasound ONSD assessment","timeFrame":"3, 24, 48 hours after admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"correlation between invasive intra-cranial pression assessment and ultasound ratio of ONSD assessment and eyeball transverse diameter","description":"correlation between invasive ICP/(ONSD/ETD)","timeFrame":"3, 24, 48 hours after admission"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nacute brain injury patients with an invasive intra-cranial pressure monitoring\n\n-\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\npatients affected by disease or trauma of eye ball patients or relatives that don't want to participate to the study\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"acute brain injury patients at risk of intra-cranial hypertension","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna","city":"Bologna","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.49381,"lon":11.33875}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"9202262","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Hansen HC, Helmke K.
