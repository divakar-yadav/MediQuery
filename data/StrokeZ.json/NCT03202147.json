double-blinded, placebo-controlled study for subjects with evidence of PSCI.","detailedDescription":"This Phase II study is designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study for subjects with evidence of PSCI.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to the Group I arm (ALZT-OP1a adjuvant treatment), which will consist of ALZT-OP1a for inhalation, taken twice daily (morning and evening), OR the Group II placebo arm, which will consist of inhaled placebo, taken twice daily (morning and evening).\n\nA minimum of 350 subjects will be randomized to receive one of two possible treatment assignments: ALZT-OP1a adjuvant treatment of active study drug or placebo.\n\nTo account for subject dropouts (estimated rate of 30%), it is anticipated that up to 500 (or 250 subjects per treatment arm) may be recruited and randomized, to achieve a minimum of 175 evaluable subjects per treatment arm.\n\nRandomization assignments will be stratified by site to ensure balance by site."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment,
