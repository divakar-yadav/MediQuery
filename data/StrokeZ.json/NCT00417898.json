In ischemic stroke brain arteries are occluded either by an embolus originating in the heart or large vessels leading to the brain or by a process of acute thrombosis of the cerebral arteries over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Rupture of the plaque exposes thrombogenic elements within the plaque and leads to accumulation and activation of platelets and induction of the clotting cascade eventually leading to acute thrombosis and occlusion of the artery. TPA is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat heart and brain problems caused by blockage of arteries. It activates plasminogen and leads to disintegration of the thrombus/embolus. It is effective only if begun within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset of the stroke because of potential deleterious side effects including life threatening symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when the drug is administered outside of this time window.\n\nReperfusion of the ischemic brain (i.e. timely opening of the occluded artery) with TPA is associated with improved outcome. However, in about 33% of patients that have successfully reperfused after TPA the artery re-occludes within the first few hours resulting in worsening neurological symptoms and worse functional outcome. This re-occlusion is speculated to result from re-thrombosis over an existing ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. This is explained by the relatively short half life of TPA leaving the exposed ruptured plaque intact which leads to re-activation of platelets and clotting factors and re-thrombosis. Thus, we hypothesize that the addition of an antiplatelet agent to TPA would result in lower rates of re-occlusion after AIS. The FDA approved TPA for patients with AIS but discouraged the concomitant use of anti-platelet or anti-thrombotic drugs for the first 24hours after administration of TPA because of concerns that such therapy may result in increased rates of intracerebral hemorrhage. Aspirin is a well known platelet anti-aggregant that works by inhibition of cycloxygenase 1 and reduction in thromboxane A levels. It has a rapid onset of action and additional potential beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in patients with AIS. The international stroke study showed that acute treatment of stroke patients with 500mg of aspirin is safe and feasible and results in better outcome. Furthermore, the drug was safe in these circumstances with an ICH rate of only .\n\nTherefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the safety and efficacy of the combination of aspirin with rt-TPA in patients with AIS.","detailedDescription":"Background and Objectives:\n\nManagement of acute ischemic stroke consists of thrombolytic drugs aiming at opening occluded vessels. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is the only drug approved by the FDA (1, 2). The use of TPA is significantly limited by a relatively narrow therapeutic window of up to 3-4.5 hours following stroke onset (3, 4). Use of TPA outside of this time window is associated with an unacceptably high risk of hemorrhage including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (5, 6). While TPA is efficacious in reducing stroke associated disability its effects are limited by the phenomenon of early re-occlusion after successful reperfusion of the occluded artery.\n\nPrevious reports have shown that among patients receiving IV TPA within 3 hours of stroke onset 61% re-perfuse at 1 hour, with about 67% of these having partial recanalization and 33% complete recanalization of the occluded artery (7). reperfusion rates at 2 hours tend to be much lower ranging around 30-40% implying early re-occlusion (8). Indeed it was found that 25% of the patients that have successfully reperfused will re-occlude the artery within 2 hours (7). Re-occlusion of an already reperfused artery was more common in elderly patients with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis and higher NIHSS scores and was associated with poor outcome (7). We speculate that re-occlusion is much more common in atherothrombotic strokes compared with embolic stroke. In embolic stroke TPA disintegrates the occluding embolus frequently and there is no remaining exposed endothelium or plaque that would trigger thrombosis (9). In contrast, in atherothrombotic stroke TPA disintegrates the occluding thrombus leading to re-perfusion less frequently (9) and the exposed thrombogenic elements within the ruptured plaque remain in place triggering repeated platelet activation and re-thrombosis.\n\nBecause primary reperfusion is less frequent in patients with atherothrombotic large vessel stroke and re-occlusion is more common in these patients and both these processes involve platelet aggregation and activation at the site of thrombosis we argue that addition of anti-platelet agent would be able to increase reperfusion rates and decrease re-occlusion rates in these patients.\n\nAspirin is the most commonly used antiplatelet agent in stroke patients. It has a relatively long half life and a relatively rapid onset of therapeutic effect(10, 11). Furthermore, an additional aspirin bolus may reverse a state of aspirin resistance in patients suffering a stroke while on aspirin(12, 13). Aspirin is safe when given to patients with acute stroke as soon as the diagnosis is made (14, 15).\n\nBecause the FDA approval of TPA use for stroke patients had a pre-requisite of not using concurrent anti-thrombotic drugs in the 24 hours after TPA administration the safety of aspirin needs to be studied in a randomized trial. However, it should be noted that pre-TPA aspirin use was not associated with an increased ICH risk in patients given the drug (16) and therefore pre-morbid aspirin use is not considered a contraindication for TPA administration in acute stroke.\n\nThe study will be a randomized double blind study exploring the safety of adding 500 mg of aspirin given P.O. to standard doses of IV TPA.\n\nSTUDY ENDPOINTS:\n\nPRIMARY ENDPOINT\n\n1.

Patients will be randomized to receive rt-TPA 0.9mg/kg (10% of the total dose as an IV bolus and the reminder IV over 60 minutes) + placebo or rt-TPA 0.9mg/kg + aspirin P.O. at a dose of 500mg at the time of TPA administration.. Randomization will be accomplished using an IVRS automated system. Randomization will be into time tiers of 0-1.5 hours from symptom onset, 1.5-3 hours from symptom onset and 3-4.5 hours from symptom onset for each dose tier. Overall 60 patients (30 TPA + active drug and 30 TPA only are to be recruited). Study medications will be supplied by the hospital and will have a total volume, color and odor that will be identical to placebo. At the end of recruitment the randomization codes will be opened and the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will determine the safety of continuing the study in the next dose tier. Samples will be collected for safety data (renal, hepatic and coagulation studies) and sent to local laboratories in each center. Investigators will be notified immediately on any lab results by fax and email. ECGs will be read at a central facility and investigators will be notified on any abnormal result immediately via fax and email. All AE and SAE will be reported immediately.\n\nEVALUATIONS\n\nSafety:\n\nHemodynamics: Patients will be monitored non-invasively for blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation q2rhs in the first 24 hours post stroke and then every 6 hours for the next 24 hours and then every 12 hours for the reminder of the hospitalization.\n\nCoagulation tests: PT, PTT and PLT blood counts will be evaluated daily in the first 3 days of hospitalization.\n\nBlood tests: Blood chemistry, liver function tests and cardiac enzymes will be evaluated daily for the first 3 days and then at discharge.\n\nCardiac rhythm: ECG will be evaluated daily on a 12 lead recording on the first 3 days of hospitalization and then at discharge.\n\nCT: Brain CT will be obtained prior to drug administration and in included patients repeated scans will be obtained at 96-120 hours to evaluate final infarct size. In cases of suspected hematoma brain CT would be obtained immediately and the number of patients sustaining an ICH following drug administration will be recorded.\n\nAll other adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be recorded and promptly evaluated by the data safety monitoring board that will decide whether or not these events are drug related and which will have the authority to prematurely terminate the study in case an unexpected SAE emerges and appears to be drug related. AE and SAE will be defined conventionally such that AE is any adverse event and SAE as an AE necessitating prolongation of hospitalization or any adverse event that is potentially life threatening).\n\nNEUROLOGICAL Included patients will be examined before and after randomization with the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) on days 1,2,3,5 and discharge and on outpatient visits at months 1 and 3-post stroke.\n\nFUNCTIONAL OUTCOME Patients will be evaluated with the Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin score (MRS) administered on discharge day and during outpatient visits at month 1 and 3-post stroke.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
