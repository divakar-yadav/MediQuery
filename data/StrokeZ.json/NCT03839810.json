The main intervention strategy in stroke rehabilitation is to induce cortical plasticity for motor re-learning.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that electrical stimulation applied to the periphery can elicit abundant sensory afferent inputs to enhance excitability and activation area in the sensorimotor cortex. Recent evidence suggested that a new type of electrical stimulation pattern, stochastic resonance stimulation, is capable of efficiently enhancing the activation of peripheral and central nervous system. Therefore, the purpose of this study are to identify the effects of stochastic resonance electrical stimulation on neuromuscular control and proprioception, and to investigate the effectiveness of combining stochastic resonance electrical stimulation with rehabilitation program on post stroke motor function recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Healthy"],"keywords":["stochastic resonance","proprioception","motor control","motor recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stochastic resonance","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stochastic resonance electrical stimulation is applied to the upper extremity during the subjects perform upper extremity motor function.","interventionNames":["Other: stochastic resonance electrical stimulation"]},{"label":"sham stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham electrical stimulation (same electrode location, but no electrical current is applied) is applied to the upper extremity during the subjects perform upper extremity motor function.","interventionNames":["Other: stochastic resonance electrical stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"stochastic resonance electrical stimulation","description":"stochastic resonance electrical stimulation is applied in the upper extremity during motor functional training.\n\nSham comparator group uses sham stimulation -
