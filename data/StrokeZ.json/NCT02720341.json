Robots became a promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitative training. Investigators aim at developing a unique intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training strategy of the arm. The exoskeleton robot ARMin will be further developed to adapt software components accordingly. The goal is to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is meaningful for the individual patient. It can be intensified by different strategies that will be evaluated alone and in combination. These strategies include:\n\nstrength training an error-amplification strategy increased number of repetitions multisensory feedback multiplayer approach"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spinal Cord Injury","Healthy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":222,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ARMin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Therapy on ARMin robotic device","interventionNames":["Device: ARMin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ARMin","description":"single sessions of about one hour each","armGroupLabels":["ARMin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionaire","description":"The IMI is a multidimensional measurement device that assesses participants' interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, effort, value/usefulness, felt pressure and tension, and perceived choice while performing a given activity, thus yielding six subscale scores","timeFrame":"within one day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"performance tests (kinematic and kinetic data) in virtual reality on the ARMin robot (time in msec)","description":"kinematic and kinetic data during motor performance will be recorded","timeFrame":"within one day"},{"measure":"performance tests (kinematic and kinetic data) in virtual reality on the ARMin robot (position in cm)","description":"kinematic and kinetic data during motor performance will be recorded","timeFrame":"within one day"},{"measure":"performance tests (kinematic and kinetic data) in virtual reality on the ARMin robot ( force in Nm)","description":"kinematic and kinetic data during motor performance will be recorded","timeFrame":"within one day"},{"measure":"muscle strength in Nm","description":"muscle strength will be recorded by the device","timeFrame":"within one day"},{"measure":"questionaire on interaction, time and effort","description":"questions rated on a analog scale by the participant regarding the interaction with participants and therapists, the perceived time and the perceived effort","timeFrame":"within one day"},{"measure":"EMG for muscle activity (time and electric potential)","description":"The level of muscular activity will be assessed by surface electromyography (EMG).
