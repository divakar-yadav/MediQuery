Due to the neurological damage from stroke, a vast majority of individuals suffer from hand function disability (\\~70%). To improve hand function and overcome challenges from this disability, IRegained has developed the MyHandTM system, a connected mechatronic device with programmed proprietary hand function training protocols developed through deep research in neuroplasticity that provide targeted hand function therapy. When these therapeutic protocols are provided in a gamified format, it enhances the patient engagement and motivation, thereby enabling effective therapy administration with the required intensity and repetition to improve hand function. Participants who have sustained a stroke 6 months or earlier will be eligible to participate in this study, and will undergo hand function therapy for one 1-hour/session, 5 times/week, over a 3-week duration, for a total of 15 sessions. Therapy will be administered through with specific hand functions in a gamified format to enhance greater function in the hand and thereby help patients gain greater independence in performing activities of daily living. This research project will aim to understand the extent to which this approach to therapy impacts patient motivation and engagement in order to develop the most efficient and effective mode of therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand Function","Rehabilitation","Engagement","Motor control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurorehabilitation of the Hand","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: MyHand System Hand Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MyHand System Hand Rehabilitation","description":"15 1-hour patient specific sessions using the MyHand System to help improve Hand function in the affected hand of stroke survivors","armGroupLabels":["Neurorehabilitation of the Hand"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the Nasa-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)","description":"an assessment tool used to evaluate the participant's perceived cognitive load during an activity will be used.
