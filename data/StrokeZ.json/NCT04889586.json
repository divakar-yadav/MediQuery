Innovative technologies are a valid support for the delivery of rehabilitation treatments. Embedding surface electromyographic (sEMG) into wearable devices, allows the customisation of rehabilitation exercises, based on the clinical profile of each patient.","detailedDescription":"The aims of this study are to determine safety and feasibility of a prototype EMG-control wearable device (REMO) and to individualise clinical features of stroke survivors able to control the EMG armband targeted to hand rehabilitation.\n\nThe device REMO consists in an armband composed by 8 bipolar electrodes able to record and process the electromyography of forearm muscles. The patterns of muscle activations are classified and used to perform EMG-biofeedback exercises in stroke rehabilitation training. The device is developed by clinicians of IRCCS San Camillo Hospital and spin-off Morecognition Srl.\n\nA total of 100 stroke patients patients has been recruited. They are clinically assessed and then tested on the ability to control the sEMG wearable device. The test is composed of 10 hand and fingers gestures to be performed with the paretic hand. Baseline and activation sEMG signals are recorded and compared for each movement. Three conditions representing absent, partial or full control of the device are defined and logistic multivarialbes regression models are used to identify clinical features describing the group each patient belongs to. Clinical cut-off for each strata is identified by odds ratio."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke, Ischemic","Hemiparesis","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Neurological Rehabilitation","Upper Extremity","Electromyography","Hand Gesture"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Each subject is assessed with a clinical protocol and an instrumental test, consists in executing 10 hand gestures by wearing a EMG-biofeedback armband","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The subjects were clinically assessed with a define clinical protocol.
