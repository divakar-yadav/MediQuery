Pelvic floor muscle contraction will be evaluated via transabdominal ultrasound. ultrasound.","detailedDescription":"Sub-acute stroke patients during the rehabilitation period in the rehabilitation hospital will be examined. Each participant will be asked to contract the pelvic floor muscles using three different verbal instructions: (1) \"contract your pelvic floor - all sphincters\"; (2) \"contract your anus\"; (3) \"contract your pelvic floor as if you're trying to stop urinating\". Those who will not be able to contract will be taught by the ultrasound as a biofeedback.\n\nThe assessment of pelvic floor contraction will be measured by measuring bladder displacement via abdominal ultrasound. A curved linear array transducer will be placed in the transverse plane immediately suprapubically over the lower abdomen angled at 15-30 degrees from the vertical. An on screen caliper and measurement tool will be used to measure bladder displacement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pelvic Floor Muscle Weakness"],"keywords":["verbal cue, pelvic diaphragm, stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"all participants will receive the same verbal instruction","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":77,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Verbal instruction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will be verbal instructed to contract the pelvic floor muscle with the following sentences:\n\n(1) \"contract your pelvic floor - all sphincters\"; (2) \"contract your anus\"; (3) \"contract your pelvic floor as if you're trying to stop urinating\".\n\nThose who will not be able to contract will be taught by the ultrasound as a biofeedback.","interventionNames":["Other: verbal instruction"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"verbal instruction","description":"Verbal instruction for pelvic floor contraction will be given to participants.
