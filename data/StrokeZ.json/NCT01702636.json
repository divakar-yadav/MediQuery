The density (in Hounsfield units) should be greater than that of the background haematoma (site investigators are not required to document the density); and\n  3. No hyperdensity at the corresponding location on non-contrast CT.\n* Age ≥18 years\n* Treatment can commence within 1 hour of initial CT and within 4.5 hours of symptom onset (or in patients with unknown time of symptom onset, the time patient was last known to be well)\n* Informed consent has been received in accordance to local ethics committee requirements\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Glasgow coma scale (GCS) total score of \\<8\n* Brainstem ICH\n* ICH volume \\>70 ml as measured by the ABC/2 method\n* ICH known or suspected by study investigator to be secondary to trauma, aneurysm, vascular malformation, haemorrhagic transformation of ischaemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, thrombolytic therapy, tumor, or infection\n* Contrast already administered within 24 hours prior to initial CT or contraindication to imaging with CT contrast agents (e.g. known or suspected iodine allergy or significant renal failure)\n* Any history or current evidence suggestive of venous or arterial thrombotic events within the previous 12 months, including clinical, ECG, laboratory, or imaging findings. Clinically silent chance findings of old ischemia are not considered exclusion.\n* Hereditary or acquired haemorrhagic diathesis or coagulation factor deficiency.\n* Use of heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, GPIIb/IIIa antagonist, or oral anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin, factor Xa inhibitor, thrombin inhibitor) within the previous 14 days, irrespective of laboratory values\n* Pregnancy (women of childbearing potential must be tested)\n* Planned surgery for ICH within 24 hours\n* Concurrent or planned treatment with haemostatic agents (e.g. prothrombin complex concentrate, vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or platelet transfusion)\n* Participation in any investigational study in the last 30 days\n* Known terminal illness or planned withdrawal of care or comfort care measures.\n* Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator could impose hazards to the patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Atte Meretoja, MD","affiliation":"The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Geoffrey A Donnan, MD","affiliation":"The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Stephen M Davis, MD","affiliation":"Melbourne Health","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Gosford Hospital","city":"Kanwal","state":"New South Wales","zip":"2259","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-33.253,"lon":151.4911}},{"facility":"John Hunter Hospital","city":"Newcastle","state":"New South Wales","zip":"2310","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-32.92715,"lon":151.77647}},{"facility":"St. Vincent's Hospital","city":"Sydney","state":"New South Wales","zip":"2010","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-33.86785,"lon":151.20732}},{"facility":"Royal Prince Alfred Hospital","city":"Sydney","state":"New South Wales","zip":"2050","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-33.86785,"lon":151.20732}},{"facility":"Westmead Hospital","city":"Westmead","state":"New South Wales","zip":"2145","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-33.80383,"lon":150.98768}},{"facility":"Royal Adelaide Hospital","city":"Adelaide","state":"South Australia","zip":"5000","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-34.92866,"lon":138.59863}},{"facility":"Box Hill Hospital","city":"Box Hill","state":"Victoria","zip":"3128","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-37.81887,"lon":145.12545}},{"facility":"Western Hospital","city":"Footscray","state":"Victoria","zip":"3011","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-37.8,"lon":144.9}},{"facility":"Frankston Hospital","city":"Frankston","state":"Victoria","zip":"3199","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-38.14458,"lon":145.12291}},{"facility":"The Royal Melbourne Hospital","city":"Melbourne","state":"Victoria","zip":"3050","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-37.814,"lon":144.96332}},{"facility":"Helsinki University Central Hospital","city":"Helsinki","country":"Finland","geoPoint":{"lat":60.16952,"lon":24.93545}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35300248","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Yogendrakumar V, Wu TY, Churilov L, Tatlisumak T, Strbian D, Jeng JS, Kleinig TJ, Sharma G, Campbell BC, Zhao H, Hsu CY, Meretoja A, Donnan GA, Davis SM, Yassi N.
