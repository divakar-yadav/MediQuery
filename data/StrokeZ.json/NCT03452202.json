Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which delivers low-intensity current to the scalp, and is a safe and well-tolerated approach that poses a non-significant risk to participants. tDCS provides low intensity neural stimulation which has been shown to facilitate motor learning in other domains of stroke rehabilitation such as arm motor learning but the potential to enhance speech motor learning has not been explored. This will be examined with a series of single-case experimental designs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Apraxia of Speech"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"crossover design such that each participant receives behavioral treatment twice - once with active stimulation and once with sham stimulation - in order to evaluate differences in improvement based on treatment condition.","interventionNames":["Device: Soterix 1x1 line tDCS low-intensity stimulator","Device: Sham"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"crossover design such that each participant receives behavioral treatment twice - once with active stimulation and once with sham stimulation - in order to evaluate differences in improvement based on treatment condition.","interventionNames":["Device: Soterix 1x1 line tDCS low-intensity stimulator","Device: Sham"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Soterix 1x1 line tDCS low-intensity stimulator","description":"Introduction of the independent variable (treatment) across three different points in time.
