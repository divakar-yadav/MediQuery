Helps smokers with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke to quit smoking over the long-term, compared to simply providing a prescription for these medications;\n2. Is a more cost-effective alternative to providing a prescription only for these medications in this high risk population.\n\nHypotheses to be Tested\n\nThe hypotheses to be tested include the following:\n\n1. The CO-validated continuous abstinence rate at weeks 26 and 52 following a target quit date will be at least 10% higher for the cost-free smoking cessation pharmacotherapy intervention group compared to the prescription only usual care group;\n2. Cost-free smoking cessation pharmacotherapy will have a greater cost-effectiveness (i.e., cost/quit) than providing a prescription only.","detailedDescription":"Smokers with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke attending a Stroke Prevention Clinic and willing to quit smoking will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either a prescription only (PO) usual care group or a cost-free (CF) pharmacotherapy experimental group. Participants assigned to the prescription only usual care group will be asked to have their prescription for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy filled at their own cost at their local community pharmacy. Participants assigned to the cost-free pharmacotherapy group will be provided with a 12-week supply of NRT, or a 12-week supply of bupropion or varenicline. The pharmacotherapy will be provided by the research nurse to the patient immediately. All participants will receive identical advice regarding smoking from the attending neurologist, nurse counseling for smoking cessation, and follow-up tracking and telephone-based support for up to 26 weeks after the target quit date. Non-treatment follow-up will continue to week 52 after the target quit date."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Smoking Cessation"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular disease","stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","smoking cessation","Pharmacotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":194,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cost-Free Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Cost-Free Pharmacotherapy Group"]},{"label":"Prescription Only Group","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: Prescription Only Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cost-Free Pharmacotherapy Group","description":"Participants assigned to the cost-free pharmacotherapy group will be provided with a 12-week supply of NRT, or a 12-week supply of bupropion or varenicline.\n\nPatients smoking 10 cigarettes or less will be prescribed 7mg/24hours for 12 weeks.
