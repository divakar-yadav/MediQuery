Patients who have had ischemic stroke (as confirmed by diffusion weighted MRI) and have had or will undergo 3D whole-brain vessel wall MRI within 8 weeks of symptom onset will be recruited into this study. It is anticipated that a total of 1000 subjects will be recruited from Feb 2017 to Feb 2019. Approximately 12 centers in the US and China will participate in the registry. MRI whole-brain vessel wall images will be analyzed for detection and characteristics of various vessel wall pathologies and association between vessel wall imaging findings and patient's clinical information."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MRI","description":"Contrast-enhanced MRI"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Vessel wall pathology findings by MRI","description":"To identify vessel wall pathologies such as atherosclerosis, dissection, vasculitis","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or female â‰¥ 18 years of age\n* Ischemic stroke onset within 8 weeks and confirmed by diffusion weighted MRI\n* Ability to read and understand informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* The cause of stroke has been confirmed to be related to cardiac or extracranial carotid or aorta pathologies.\n* Contraindications to MR imaging including mechanically, magnetically, or electrically activated implants, ferromagnetic implants and ferromagnetic foreign bodies, pregnancy.\n* Inability to tolerate MRI imaging secondary to an inability to lie supine or severe claustrophobia.\n* Non-compliant with visit instructions, including inability to lie still, hold breath or follow procedure instructions","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients had recent ischemic stroke and have had or will undergo 3D whole-brain vessel wall MRI within 8 weeks of symptom onset.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Zhaoyang Fan, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"310 248-8661","email":"zhaoyang.fan@cshs.org"},{"name":"Qi Yang, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"310 248-8676","email":"qi.yang@cshs.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Zhaoyang Fan, PhD","affiliation":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Qi Yang, MD,PhD","affiliation":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Debiao Li, PhD","affiliation":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Keck Hospital of the University of Southern California","status":"NOT_YET_RECRUITING","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California","zip":"90033","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"May Anne Kim-Tenser, MD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":34.05223,"lon":-118.24368}},{"facility":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California","zip":"90048","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Shlee Song, MD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":34.05223,"lon":-118.24368}},{"facility":"Torrance Memorial Medical Center","status":"NOT_YET_RECRUITING","city":"Torrance","state":"California","zip":"90505","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Edward S.
