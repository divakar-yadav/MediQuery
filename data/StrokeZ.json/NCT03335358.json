Mood and well-being will be assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. It is expected that both partners will demonstrate improvement in mood and well-being.","detailedDescription":"Stroke survivors and spousal caregivers face significant challenges, yet interventions to support couples after stroke are largely lacking. Depressive symptoms post-stroke occur in 30-50% of survivors and partner caregivers, and have significant consequences on function and quality of life. Further, mood and psychosocial well-being are reciprocal in couples, meaning if one partner is depressed, the other is more likely to be depressed. Sustaining well-being in both partners is important for continued engagement in rehabilitation and re-integration into the community, yet existing interventions are aimed at the individual rather than the couple. This study will address this gap by testing an innovative dyadic (couples-based) intervention using a new approach based on positive psychology that focuses on the strengths in the relationship in order to foster resilience in the couple. Using a randomized waitlist control design, this pilot study aims to determine whether an 8-week dyadic positive psychology-based intervention (PPI) can improve mood and subjective well-being as assessed by established outcome measures in 24 couples coping with stroke. The intervention consists of self-administered PPI activities, such as expressing gratitude and practicing acts of kindness, which participants complete individually and as a couple. Two potential pathways will be explored for the PPI: (a) enhanced quality of interactions as couples deal with daily life demands and (b) improvements in mood that are \"contagious\" among couples. If found effective, couples with greater well-being may be better emotionally equipped to cope with the sequelae of stroke by reducing stress and depressive symptoms, and increasing participation in meaningful activities and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression","Depressive Symptoms","Post-stroke Depression"],"keywords":["couples","positive psychology","behavioral intervention","stroke","depression","wellbeing","caregiver"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Waitlist control design; participants are assigned to receive intervention or be waitlisted for 4-6 weeks and then receive intervention.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Positive Psychology Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants complete baseline assessments and receive a 20min training on the positive psychology activities.
