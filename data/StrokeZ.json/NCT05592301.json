The evidence base, however, comes from retrospective studies with numerous limitations.\n\nPatients referred for general, orthopedic, urological, gynecologic, spinal, or thoracic surgery will be screened and consented during the surgery pre-admission clinic visit, and then undergo PFO screening using transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients screened PFO+ (n=102) and matched PFO- controls (n=102) will have DW-MRI between postoperative days 2 and 7. Study personnel will conduct phone surveys at 30-day and 1-year post-surgery to collect data on other clinical outcomes. Patients will also be administered cognitive and patient-reported outcome measures assessments before enrollment, and 30-day and 1-year follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patent Foramen Ovale"],"keywords":["Patent Foramen Ovale","Perioperative Stroke","Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":408,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Surgical patients","description":"Patients undergoing major non-cardiac, non-vascular, and non-brain surgery who will be examined for a presence of PFO","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI)","Diagnostic Test: Transcranial Doppler (TCD)","Diagnostic Test: Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI)","description":"The Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) is used to diagnose perioperative stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Surgical patients"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transcranial Doppler (TCD)","description":"Used to diagnose PFO","armGroupLabels":["Surgical patients"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)","description":"Used to diagnose PFO.","armGroupLabels":["Surgical patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of PFO in the target (surgical) population","description":"Identifying PFO status using TCD \\& TTE","timeFrame":"Pre-operative"},{"measure":"The incidence of perioperative stroke in patients without PFO","description":"Identifying perioperative stroke incidence using DW-MRI","timeFrame":"Within 30 days of surgery"},{"measure":"Study enrollment rate","description":"Establishing study enrollment rate and the reasons for refusals to participate","timeFrame":"Pre-operative"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients completing the DW-MRI test","description":"Developing mechanisms to successfully arrange the DW-MRI within a short timeframe","timeFrame":"2-7 days post surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. patients 18 years and above;\n2. referred for an elective, non-cardiac, non-vascular and non-brain surgery;\n3. with an estimated hospital length of stay â‰¥2 days.
