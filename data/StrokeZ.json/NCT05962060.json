By decreasing the tone, spasticity may be reduced in stroke patients and may inturn lead to better approaches to treat those patients. So, the findings of this study can help in formulation of future guidelines for management of stroke that will help the clinicians to treat such patients in more efficient way..","detailedDescription":"A RCT that investigated the effects of PNF interventions in patients of chronic stroke using balance and gait as outcome measures. 19 studies with 532 participants were included, of which 12 studies with 327 participants were included for meta-analysis. When data was pooled, PNF made significantly improvement in balance and gait of chronic stroke patients. This review indicates that PNF is a potential treatment strategy in chronic stroke rehabilitation on balance and gait.\n\nA systematic review to investigate the effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on spasticity post-stroke. Six studies were included in this systematic review. Three were pilot studies, clinical controlled trials, and randomized controlled trials. The findings of this study showed evidence on the benefits of the PNF intervention on spasticity post-stroke.\n\nA study is to identify the effectiveness of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) leg Kinesio taping on gait parameters and dynamic balance in chronic stroke patients with foot drop. A total 22 chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. All subjects underwent conventional therapy and gait training for 50 mints. All of the measurements were performed baseline and 24 h after intervention. The Results of this study yields that the short-term effect of application of lower-leg KT according to the PNF pattern increased the gait ability and dynamic balance of chronic stroke patients with foot drop.\n\nGAP: As it is evident from the literature that PNF and EMS has beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic stroke patients and little work has been done on seeing the mechanism of its effects on upper limb of chronic stroke patients. But up to the researcher's knowledge least work has been done on seeing its effects in specifically lower limb and gait of stroke patients. So, in this study the effects of PNF with and without EMS will be documented in the lower limb of stroke patients in terms of spasticity and their gait."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Electrical Muscle Stimulation","Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation","Physiotherapy","Spasticity","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Electrical Muscle Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive PNF techniques (rhythmic initiation to stabilizing reversals and then then followed by dynamic reversals) with EMS to improve their spasticity, gait and lower limb functions.
