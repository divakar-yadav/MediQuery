The BBPM weighs less than 0.03 ounces and measures 1\" x 0.1\". It is implanted into the shoulder to stimulate the axillary nerve. Stimulation of this nerve may reduce shoulder pain, reduce shoulder subluxation, improve motion, improve function, and possibly decrease use of pain medication. CAUTION--Investigational device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, double-blinded parallel study designed to evaluate feasibility and safety. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of implanting the BBPM near a peripheral nerve for the treatment of chronic, intractable, pain in this case represented by chronic regional shoulder pain in hemiplegic stroke patients. This is a 48-week efficacy study with safety data collection throughout the study period and up to 2 years for all available subjects. Each study arm will receive therapeutic level stimulation for a total of 12 consecutive weeks (Weeks 1-12 for Active treatment group and Weeks 24-36 for the sham group) during the 48 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Shoulder Pain Chronic"],"keywords":["shoulder","pain","stroke","subluxation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active BBPM stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Therapeutic Stimulation is applied via the Battery Powered Microneuromodulator (BBPM) which is programmed to deliver set stimulation parameters with approximate frequency of 30 Hz, current 5mA for 200 microseconds for the first 12 weeks of the study.
