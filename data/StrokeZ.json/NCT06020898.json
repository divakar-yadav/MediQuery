Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels.","detailedDescription":"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy.\n\nSodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke.\n\nThe goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells.\n\nPatients with acute ischemic stroke included in the study will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Sodium valproate","Acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low-dose sodium valproate group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Within 3 days after admission, 10mg/kg sodium valproate will be given daily.
