Its impact on morbidity and mortality is well known in gerontology, oncology and intensive care. There are very few neurovascular studies dealing with the consequences of undernutrition present before the stroke. Indeed, most of the medical literature concerns only undernutrition acquired after a stroke. The investigator propose to analyze medical data from a cohort of patients over 70 years of age thrombolysed and/or thrombectomized in the neurovascular department between the years 2014 and 2019."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":248,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical evolution of the patients: NIHSS","description":"This outcome correspond to the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) at day 5.
