The Berg balance scale (BBS) is used to assess the participant's ability to retain stability. The BBS is a widely used test for the assessment of elderly population with impairment of balance and individuals with neurological disorder while sitting, standing, and transferring. This test included both static and dynamic type task. The BBS uses a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (disability) to 4(complete independent performance) and consists of 14 components; the maximum score is 56 points. The scale has been shown to be reliable and valid in stroke patients. A cut-off score of 45 points is used for fall prediction. The BBS involves 14 tasks; a total score of 56. Equipment required for this test were a stop watch or watch with a second's hand and a ruler or other indicator of 2, 5, and 10 inches.","timeFrame":"Immediately after Intervention and then again after 1 hour."},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go test","description":"Changes from the base line, Immediately after Intervention and then again after 1 hour. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was designed for the evaluation of balance and Measures mobility in people who are able to walk on their own (assistive device permitted) to find out the risk of fall . The subjects will be required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. The time taken to complete this task will be measured. The test will be informed three times. The time required to complete this task will be measured from a stopwatch. The average values from 3 trials, with 1-min rest between each trial, were used for data analysis.","timeFrame":"Immediately after Intervention and then again after 1 hour."},{"measure":"Balance Evaluation Systems Test","description":"Changes from the base line, Immediately after Intervention and then again after 1 hour..

Scores of MoCA ranges from 0-30.Interpretation of MoCA indicates that score of 26 and above normal, 18 -25 score indicates low cognitive impairments, 10 -18 score considered normal or moderate cognitive impairment while greater than 10 is considered to be severe cognitive impairments.","timeFrame":"1 hour"},{"measure":"tDCS Adverse Effects Questionnaire :","description":"Changes from the base line, Immediately after Intervention and then again after 1 hour..
