All patients included in the study should meet the inclusion criteria. All participants will receive one of antiplatelet drugs (Aspirin or Clopidogrel). Half of participants will receive Sanchitongshu and Aspirin or Clopidogrel, while the other half will receive a placebo and Aspirin or Clopidogrel.
