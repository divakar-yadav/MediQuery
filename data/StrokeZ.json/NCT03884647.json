The DELPhi software uses EEG and TMS devices as accessories. Standard electro-physiological acquisition is performed using TMS to evoke regional neuronal potentials measured as EEG data. TMS-EEG data is analyzed with regards to conventional, well established characteristics of neuronal network plasticity and connectivity.","detailedDescription":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method that allows to study human cortical function in vivo. Using TMS for examining human cortical functionality is enhanced by combining TMS with simultaneous registration of electroencephalograph (EEG). EEG provides an opportunity to directly measure the cerebral response to TMS. Measuring the cortical TMS Evoked potential (TEP), is used to assess cerebral reactivity across wide areas of neocortex.\n\nBy evaluating the propagation of evoked activity in different behavioral states and in different tasks, TMS-EEG has been used to causally probe the dynamic effective connectivity of human brain networks.\n\nIn this study the sponsor is intended to collect data of subjects at the ages of 50-75, at risk for stroke and dementia using DELPHI, brain MRI scans, cognitive tests and clinical and demographic information. Some of the patients agreeing to perform a second test will serve for a reliability test.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. Definition of DELPHI's average TEP response of at risk for stroke and dementia population in subjects over 50-75 years old+/- STD.\n2. Assessing the Safey of the use of DELPHI in at risk for stroke and dementia population.\n3. Defining DELPHI's test-retest reliability by quantifying correlation coefficient between two tests.\n\nExploratory objectives:\n\n1. Evaluating the sham stimulation effect.\n2. Assessing confounders effecting results.\n\nSubjects will perform a medical interview, neurological exam, cognitive evaluations, two emotional inventories and a brain MRI scan."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hypertension","Diabete Mellitus","Dyslipidemias","Sleep Disorder","Smoking","Overweight and Obesity","Familial Alzheimer Disease","Atrial Fibrillation","Cardiac Disease","Cognitive Impairment","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":335,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DELPhI system","description":"DELPhI software is acquiring and analyzing the TMS evoked response recorded with the EEG.","otherNames":["Transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Establishing DELPhI's norms of population 50-75 years old at risk for stroke and dementia","description":"Mean, STD, standard error (SEM), coefficient of variation (CV%), minimum, median, maximum and 95% confidence interval, for every DELPHI parameter in at risk for stroke and dementia population.","timeFrame":"1 visit"},{"measure":"Establish DELPhI's safety in subjects 50-75 at risk for stroke and dementia.","description":"Rates and Frequencies of Adverse events and descriptive report of Adverse events and possible relationship to DELPHI.","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"DELPHI's reliability","description":"Examining DELPHI's reliability by defining Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) coefficients between two tests performed at different days and/or different operators at each of DELPHI's parameters.","timeFrame":"1 visit"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n1.
