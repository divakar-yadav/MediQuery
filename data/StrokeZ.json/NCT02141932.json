In special it is important to reveal if carotid artery stenosis is present as such a finding will directly influence on treatment and follow-up.\n\nFor the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis ultrasound examinations is the cornerstone, but computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may be better in some cases. Development of high quality pocket-sized ultrasound scanners has allowed for semi quantitatively bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart.\n\nThe investigators aim to study the feasibility and reliability of bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart by pocket-sized ultrasound scanners and the clinical influence of this examination when performed by experienced users.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that a significant proportion of this patient population can be clarified bed-side with no need of further imaging procedures for the assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart.","detailedDescription":"Population: Approximately 100 patients admitted to the Department of Medicine, Levanger Hospital with history and findings suspicious of stroke/transitory ischemic attack (TIA). Informed consent mandatory.\n\nNo exclusion criteria.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nThe carotid arteries and the heart can be assessed bed-side by pocket-size ultrasound scanners with high feasibility and reliability.\n\nBed-side assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart by pocket-size ultrasound scanners may reduce the need for more advanced (higher cost) imaging procedures.\n\nMethods:\n\nPocket-size imaging device from GE Ultrasound, commercial available. Approved for clinical use. High-end echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasound by high-end equipment (GE Vivid 9) and computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at the Department of Radiology, Levanger Hospital."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Attack, Transient","Transient Ischemic Attack","Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebrovascular Apoplexy","Apoplexy"],"keywords":["Hand-held","Ultrasound","Diagnosis","Cardiovascular","Carotid artery stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bed-side pocket-size ultrasound","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will be examined bed-side by pocket size ultrasound for the assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart.
