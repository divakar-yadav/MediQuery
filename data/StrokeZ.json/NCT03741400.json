The aims of the study is to demonstrate:\n\n1. the effect of Smart Glove use on functional recovery, in addition to standard of care rehabilitation therapy.\n2. the feasibility of increasing the dose of rehabilitation in acute stroke patients with the Smart Glove.\n3. the effect of Smart Glove use on quality of life.","detailedDescription":"The Neofect Smart Glove is a commercially available, non-invasive biofeedback based system for distal upper extremity rehabilitation. The Smart Glove is very lightweight and allows for easy movement of all distal upper extremity joints. It consists of a glove-shaped sensor device and a software application which can be used with either a large screen or a portable tablet. The system includes multiple Activities of Daily Living (ADL)-based training games, and the system tracks the motion and posture of the wearer's distal limb as they participate. Games can be selected to focus on certain movements (such as forearm pronation/supination, wrist flexion/extension, finger flexion/extension, etc.) based on the needs of the wearer. The software includes a smart learning algorithm, in which the computer automatically adjusts to the optimal level of difficulty to balance challenge and motivation. After initial set-up, the device requires no therapist supervision to use.\n\nPatients will be eligible for the study if they have had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and (2) have impaired arm/hand function secondary to the stroke (see below for specific inclusion and exclusion criteria). We will recruit eligible patients from acute care hospitals, acute rehabilitation units, and outpatient facilities. Enrolled patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to standard rehabilitation therapy versus standard rehabilitation therapy plus Smart Glove use. All patients will be allowed to participate in any scheduled outpatient rehabilitation during the study.\n\nThe study consists of a 12-week intervention period and a 12-week follow-up period. During the 12-week intervention period all patients will receive their usual rehabilitation therapy, with their therapists documenting rehabilitation dose in a journal provided at the start of the study. In addition, subjects randomized to the Smart Glove therapy arm will be provided with a Smart Glove system, which includes the glove and tablet. Subjects will be instructed to use the system for at least one session per day for 5 days per week during the 12-week intervention period. Participants will present for in-person visits on weeks 6, 12, and 24 for blinded assessments by study coordinators. At the completion of the intervention period, subjects will return the Smart Glove and subjects in both arms of the study will only receive usual care during the 12-week follow-up period. Subjects will have a final assessment at week 24 (12 weeks after completing the intervention) to assess for persistence of effect.\n\nAll efficacy analyses are analyzed under the intention to treat principle. The primary efficacy outcome is the change in score on the Jebsen Taylor Hand Test between baseline and week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints are changes in scores on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Scale, Stroke Impact Scale, and total dose of rehabilitation received during the 24-week intervention period. Persistence of the treatment effect will be tested by comparing changes in scores on the Jebsen Taylor Hand Test and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score at 24 weeks between treatment groups"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["motor weakness","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessor that will be performing the interval assessments will be blinded to treatment arm.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Occupational Therapy + Smart Glove","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects randomized to this arm will be expected to use the Neofect Rapael Smart Glove for a minimum of 20-30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, in addition to prescribed occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Neofect RAPAEL Smart Glove"]},{"label":"Standard Occupational Therapy","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects in the control arm will undergo standard of care occupational therapy as prescribed by their care team."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Neofect RAPAEL Smart Glove","description":"The Neofect Rapael Smart Glove is a biofeedback system designed for upper extremity rehabilitation in stroke survivors.
