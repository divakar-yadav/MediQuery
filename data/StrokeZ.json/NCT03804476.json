AER-271 is an Aquaporin-4 inhibitor designed to prevent brain swelling in severe ischemic stroke. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A is a single ascending dose, sequential group study. The subsequent Part B is a multiple ascending dose, sequential group study. Both Parts A and B will follow an adaptive design including the use of Sentinel Dosing.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple IV doses and continuous infusion of AER-271 in healthy subjects. Secondary objectives include: determining the pharmacokinetics of AER-271 and AER-270 following administration of AER-271, determining the dose proportionality for AER-270 and 271, and comparing the effects of continuous infusion versus multiple bolus doses on AER-271 exposure and adverse events. An additional exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of AER-271 on electrocardiogram parameters including QT interval corrected for heart rate. Data from this trial will also be used to develop a protocol for a subsequent Phase 2 clinical trial in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["stroke","acute ischemic stroke","cerebral edema"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential-group, single and multiple intravenous dose escalation study conducted in 2 parts.
