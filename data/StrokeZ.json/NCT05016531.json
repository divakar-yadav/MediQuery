We will investigate the optimal spatial-peak temporal-average intensity/ISPTA in the range of 0(or sham) W/cm2 to 8 W/cm2. Safety will be investigated by assessing clinically detectable signs and symptoms by monitoring vital signs and surveying subjects with a questionnaire before and after each stimulation session, and additionally by detecting subclinical neuronal injury using MRI/DWI. Aim 1 requires up to 36 subjects.\n\nAim 2 is to determine the optimal frequency of LIFU stimulation in stroke patients in terms of cortical excitability. Stroke subjects undergo each of the 5 frequency levels (0.35 MHz; 0.5 MHz; 0.75 MHz, 1.0 MHz and 1.5 MHz) on 5 different days with at least one day washout. The intensity (ISPTA) will set up at the level that is determined from Aim 1. Cortical excitability is measured by the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) from the Abductor Pollicis Brevis (ABP) muscle of the affected side. MEPs will be recorded pre- and post-stimulation to determine the optimal intensity for maximal cortical excitability from the hemisphere where the lesion is located. Aim 2 requires 18 subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["low intensity focused ultrasound","stroke","brain stimulation","ultrasonic stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"There are different combinations of intensity and frequency with LIFUS","interventionNames":["Device: Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation","Device: Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation Frequency"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation","description":"Brain stimulation using ultrasonic stimulation in a sequence of increasing intensity (sham, 1 W/CM2, 2 W/CM2, 4 W/CM2, 6 W/CM2, 8 W/CM2)","armGroupLabels":["Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation Frequency","description":"Brain stimulation using ultrasonic stimulation of intensity level determined from intervention 1 at progressively increasing frequency levels (0.35 MHz; 0.5 MHz; 0.75 MHz, 1.0 MHz and 1.5 MHz)","armGroupLabels":["Low Intensity Focused Ultrasonic Stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety Outcomes, as measured by the number of participants with a \"major response\" - Aim 1 of study","description":"Safety outcomes are measured by \"major response\" which is pre-defined by any of the following event\n\n* Second degree skin injury;\n* Clinical seizure;\n* New lesion on DWI sequence of MRI scan and the lesion not explained by any other cause(s) or decreased ADC under the transducer stimulating motor cortex area;\n* Patient discontinues from the study due to any reason\n\nThis is a 3+3 study design.
