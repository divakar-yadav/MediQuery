As a neuroprotective agent, progesterone has been effective in several animal models of nerve injury, suggesting that the drug has a wide range of neuroprotective effects. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that some characteristic mechanisms of the action of the neurosteroid on brain injury and cerebral congestion include: prevention of inflammatory reaction and cell death (by inhibiting the activation of inflammatory cytokines and microglia); control of angiogenic brain edema (by reestablishing blood-brain barrier and regulating aquaporin-4 water transporter) and cytotoxic edema (by regulating Progesterone can also improve the neural dysfunction after cerebral hemorrhage, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged axons (activate PI3K / Akt pathway to inhibit the expression of RhoA), prevent the loss of Ca2 + caused by excitotoxicity and improve the survival rate of neurons. It was found that progesterone injection could reduce brain edema and promote the recovery of nerve function after brain injury.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this clinical trial is to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of progesterone in the clinical application of major cerebral congestion diseases. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University is the unit in charge of clinical research, and six units participate in the multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":184,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Progesterone","interventionNames":["Drug: Progesterone"]},{"label":"control grou","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"saline","interventionNames":["Other: saline"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Progesterone","description":"intramuscular injection intranasal administration","armGroupLabels":["experimental group"],"otherNames":["progesterone injection"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"saline","description":"intramuscular injection intranasal administration","armGroupLabels":["control grou"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","description":"The percentage of patients with Mrs score 0, 1 and 2 was compared.","timeFrame":"3 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute hemorrhagic stroke was confirmed by CT or MRI.
