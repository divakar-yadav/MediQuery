In our study, it was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of iTBS applied in addition to modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT). By doing so, we intend to increase patient adherence to neurorehabilitation and decrease the cost of rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"iTBS + mCIMT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation (modified constraint-induced movement therapy)","Other: non-invasive brain stimulation (intermittent theta-burst stimulation)"]},{"label":"Sham iTBS+ mCIMT group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation (modified constraint-induced movement therapy)","Other: non-invasive brain stimulation (intermittent theta-burst stimulation)"]},{"label":"mCIMT group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation (modified constraint-induced movement therapy)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation (modified constraint-induced movement therapy)","description":"Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT): It is an intervention used to improve functionality and mobility in the more affected upper extremity post-stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Sham iTBS+ mCIMT group","iTBS + mCIMT group","mCIMT group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"non-invasive brain stimulation (intermittent theta-burst stimulation)","description":"Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS): It is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and it increases the facilitation of the motor cortex.","armGroupLabels":["Sham iTBS+ mCIMT group","iTBS + mCIMT group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper extremity","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
