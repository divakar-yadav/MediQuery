However, there was no consensus of proper amount of cognitive rehabilitation in stroke patients. In this study, the investigators assess the effects of the intensive cognitive rehabilitation during subacute phase to improve cognitive function at 6 months after onset in patients with first-ever strokes.","detailedDescription":"Intensive cognitive rehabilitation group\n\n* cognitive therapy for 1 hours on every working day for 4 weeks\n\nConventional cognitive rehabilitation group\n\n* cognitive therapy for 30 minutes on every working day for 4 weeks"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Cognitive Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cognitive rehabilitation therapy for 1 hour by cognitive therapist on every working day for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Procedure: Cognitive rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Conventional group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"cognitive rehabilitation therapy for 30 minutes by cognitive therapist on every working day for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Procedure: Cognitive rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Cognitive rehabilitation","description":"Intensive cognitive rehabilitation by cognitive therapist for 1 hours on every working day during subacute stroke phase","armGroupLabels":["Conventional group","Intensive group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA)","timeFrame":"Change of K-MoCa after intensive cognitive rehabilitation for 4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute first-ever stroke\n* Korean Mini-Mental State Examination: 11\\~24 at 7 days after stroke onset\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Transient ischemic stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yun-Hee Kim, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Samsung Medical Center","city":"Seoul","zip":"135-710","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25886039","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Chang WH, Sohn MK, Lee J, Kim DY, Lee SG, Shin YI, Oh GJ, Lee YS, Joo MC, Han EY, Kim YH.
