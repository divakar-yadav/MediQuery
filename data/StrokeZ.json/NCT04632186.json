Based on theoretical background and clinical experience, this study will explore the potential value of the EXOPULSE Mollii suit-method in the management of post stroke shoulder pain. The overall aim of this study is to test and further develop the Mollii-suit for its ability to reduce hemiplegic shoulder pain. The specific aims are 1) to compare the effect of different stimulation modes for shoulder pain reduction 2) to explore which patients will respond best to these.","detailedDescription":"One challenging complication to stroke is the development of hemiplegic shoulder pain, which is reported in approximately 30% of the stroke population. Treatment strategies recommended in the Swedish National Guidelines for Stroke Care (NBHW) include use of assistive devices for arm support and treatment with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), which may impact on both pain and muscle tone. In an innovative approach, a full body suit with multiple electrodes for provision off electrical stimulation has been developed by a small Swedish med-tech company. The suit ( EXOPULSE Mollii suit) is currently used for treatment of disabling spasticity and to improve motor function in persons living with effects of central nervous system disease or injury. The theoretical background of the EXOPULSE Mollii-method primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e. that sensory input from a muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle. Thus, the application of EXOPULSE Mollii aims at stimulating a muscle, e.g. the anterior tibial muscle of the lower leg in order to reduce reflex mediated over-activity, i.e. spasticity, in calf muscles by inducing reciprocal inhibition. Studies on the effects on spasticity and perceived usability of the suit in a stroke population have recently been completed by our study group at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine Stockholm at Danderyd Hospital (dnr 2017/935-31) and preliminary analyses indicate that spasticity may be reduced by use of the suit.\n\nBased on the theoretical and practical background outlined above, this study will explore the potential value of the Mollii-method in the management of post stroke shoulder pain. The overall aim of this study is to test and further develop the Mollii-suit for its ability to reduce hemiplegic shoulder pain. The specific aims are 1) to compare the effect of different stimulation modes for shoulder pain reduction 2) to explore which patients will respond best to these."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Pain, Shoulder","Technology","Therapeutics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Explorative study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The outcome assessor will be blinded to the type of intervention provided at each session."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"3 sessions with 3 different interventions 1) Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS)- at the shoulder according to current best evidence and practice 2) EXOPULSE Mollii suits- local stimulation at the shoulder, 3) EXOPULSE Mollii suit- according to current best experienced practice\n\nThe order in which the participantsÂ´ receive the different treatments will be randomized.\n\nEach session lasts for approximately 2.5 hours (approximately 60 min for assessment, 30 min for settings and adjustments and 60 min for treatment)","interventionNames":["Device: EXOPULSE Mollii suit"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"EXOPULSE Mollii suit","description":"All sessions start with rated perceived pain with the NRS and the ShoulderQ questionnaire and assessed body function with the Fugl-Meyer UE scale, Ashworth scale and the Neuroflexor, before the start of the intervention.\n\nSession 1.
