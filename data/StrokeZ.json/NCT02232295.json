The primary outcome measures were upper limb motor functions at 6 weeks and secondary outcome measure was quality of life at 6 weeks.\n\nResearch Hypothesis: There would be significant effect of GMI on Upper limb motor functions and quality of life in patients with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is essentially a brain based treatment, targeting the activation of different brain regions in a graded manner. GMI is a three stage treatment programme comprising of Left Right discrimination training, Explicit Motor imagery and Mirror therapy.\n\nIn this Study, GMI approach is applied on the patients with Stroke to enhance their Upper limb motor functions and Quality of life.\n\nConventional treatment:\n\nPatients of group A and group B had received conventional treatment for 6 weeks. Conventional treatment consists of Task oriented upper extremity functional exercises. Components of Task oriented training include weight bearing, supportive reactions, and reaching, grasping, holding and release activities. It was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour duration.\n\nGraded Motor Imagery:\n\nPatients of group A had received GMI programme with conventional treatment for 6 weeks. It is a three stage process, was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour duration. It comprises of:\n\n* Left Right discrimination training (Implicit Motor Imagery) - 2 weeks\n* Explicit Motor Imagery (Imagined movements) - 2 weeks\n* Mirror Therapy - 2 weeks"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper extremity, motor imagery, mirror therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional group consist of Upper extremity task oriented functional exercises.

This scale includes items related to movements of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand in the upper extremity, as well as the hip, knee, and ankle in the lower extremity. For the present study, only the upper extremity was measured.The total score on the upper extremity part of the FMA ranged from 0 (hemiplegia) to a maximum of 66 points (normal motor performance). The scale was measured at baseline and post intervention.\n\nCAHAI Scale:\n\nThe purpose of this measure is to evaluate the functional ability of the hemiplegic arm and hand to perform tasks. It is designed to encourage the bilateral hand to complete the task.Each task was demonstrated once before performance, then the Score was evaluated of the affected upper extremity using the 7 point activity scale from total assistance (1) to complete","timeFrame":"six weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quality of life","description":"Secondary outcome measure:\n\nSS-QOL (Stroke Specific- Quality of life) Scale It is a self report scale containing 49 items in 12 domains.
