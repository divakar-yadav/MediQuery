However, it also increases the risk of ischemic complications in patients. The current standard dual antiplatelet regimen is considered crucial in reducing thrombotic events. Nevertheless, some patients exhibit resistance to antiplatelet drugs, which puts them at a higher risk of thrombotic events. In clinical practice, there is a lack of standardized platelet function testing and consensus on adjusting antiplatelet drug programs. This study conducted a multi-center, prospective cluster randomized controlled trial to investigate whether antiplatelet adjustment therapy guided by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) detection can decrease the occurrence of ischemic events after stent implantation in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Additionally, the study aimed to establish a set of standardized antiplatelet regimens."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Aneurysm"],"keywords":["Intracranial Aneurysm","Interventional Therapy","Stent","Platelet","Ischemic Stroke","Bleeding Event"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"cluster randomized controlled cohort study","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"To ensure the reliability of the research results, a study committee consisting of 5 members will be formed.

These committee members were blinded to the treatment group assignments. Any disagreements were resolved by a third member of the clinical events adjudication committee.
