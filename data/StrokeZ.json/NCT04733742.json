The EXTEND-IA TNK part 1 and part 2 demonstrated that intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase is superior to alteplase before endovascular treatment. However, it is unclear whether intravenous tenecteplase bridging with endovascular treatment is superior to endovascular treatment alone. The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether intravenous rhTNK-tPA bridging with endovascular treatment is better than endovascular treatment alone for stroke patients with large vessel occlusion who are thrombolysis-eligible within 4.5 hours of onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Thrombolysis","Endovascular treatment","rhTNK-tPA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":498,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conbined treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"intravenous tenecteplase bridging with endovascular treatment","interventionNames":["Drug: rhTNK-tPA","Other: Endovascular treatment"]},{"label":"Endovascular treatment alone group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"endovascular treatment alone","interventionNames":["Other: Endovascular treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"rhTNK-tPA","description":"intravenous thrombolysis with rhTNK-tPA followed by endovascular treatment","armGroupLabels":["Conbined treatment group"],"otherNames":["TNKase","TNK-tPA"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Endovascular treatment","description":"endovascular treatment","armGroupLabels":["Conbined treatment group","Endovascular treatment alone group"],"otherNames":["intra-arterial treatment","interventional therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin scale score","description":"disability level","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients non-disabled (mRS score 0 to 1) or return to pre-morbid mRS score at 90 days (for patients with mRS > 1)","description":"excellent outcome","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients functionally independent (mRS score 0 to 2) at 90 days","description":"functional independence","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients ambulatory or bodily needs-capable or better (mRS score 0 to 3)","description":"ambulatory or bodily needs-capable or better","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Substantial reperfusion at initial angiogram","description":"evaluate effect of tenecteplase on reperfusion","timeFrame":"within 5 minutes at initial angiogram"},{"measure":"Revascularization rates at 48 hours from randomization","description":"evaluate vascular patency after treatment","timeFrame":"at 48 hours from randomization"},{"measure":"Early neurologic improvement","description":"Early neurologic improvement was defined as a reduction of 8 points in the NIHSS score between baseline and 72 hours or as a score of 0 or 1 at 72 hours.
