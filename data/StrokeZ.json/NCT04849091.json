High frequency words were chosen to maximise the relevance (ecological utility) of the training to everyday life. The therapy mechanism relies on mass practice of cross-modal, paired associate learning (Holcomb and Anderson, 1993) based on the Triangle Model approach to reading. Untrained words will not be affected, and thus word reading improvements are not expected to generalise beyond trained items.\n\nThe therapy utilises gamification and is designed to be accessible in order to drive motivation and engagement for the user group. iReadMore is downloadable via the Google Play store on Android tablet devices. iReadMore is a CE-marked class 1 medical device that was developed by the Neurotherapeutics Group, University College London.\n\nAn online roll-out trial will be conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of iReadMore with a study population of real world users. The therapy will be evaluated in a clinical population with a reading impairment of any acquired cause (such as stroke or brain injury). Participants will self-enrol in the study through the app, which has been co-designed to ensure accessibility to this user group.\n\nA within-participant evaluation of trained versus untrained items will investigate the clinical effectiveness of the therapy for improving reading speed and accuracy. The primary outcomes are improvements in single word reading accuracy and speed. Interval testing will be conducted after every 5 hours of therapy. The secondary outcomes are self-reported Activities of Daily Living and a series of qualitative questions.\n\nFurther analyses will be conducted on alexia subtypes and the influence of therapy dose and intensity on the therapeutic outcomes.\n\nEthical approval for the iReadMore roll-out trial was obtained from the UCL Research Ethics Committee (ID: 7609/001)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Injuries","Aphasia","Alexia","Dementia"],"keywords":["Digital","Therapy","Reading disorder","Alexia","Dyslexia","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"iReadMore users","description":"Participants will be iReadMore users who completed a baseline reading test between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and who performed at least 5 hours of reading training and a second (interval) reading test.\n\niReadMore users will self-register to participate in the study.","interventionNames":["Device: iReadMore"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"iReadMore","description":"Digital Alexia Therapy","armGroupLabels":["iReadMore users"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Word Reading Test - Change in Reading Accuracy and Speed from baseline to 20 hours","description":"Change in single word reading accuracy and speed will be assessed in a Word Reading Test (WRT) delivered in the app. At interval tests, the WRT will include both trained and untrained words to investigate the treatment-specific effects.","timeFrame":"At baseline and after every 5 hours of therapy up to a maximum dose of 50 hours.
