Data tend to show that final neurologic outcome is superior if the thrombectomy procedure was performed under conscious sedation.\n\nThe Rothschild Foundation is a high output centre with more than 400 thrombectomy procedures every year.\n\nWe report a rate of 5% of these procedures requiring general anesthesia despite conscious sedation being the standard of care. This study aims to identify clinical factors associated with a risk of conversion of a conscious sedation to a general anesthesia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"General Sedation","description":"Case patients: Endovascular Acute Stroke Therapy scheduled to be performed under local sedation and finally performed under General anesthesia"},{"label":"local sedation","description":"Control patients: Endovascular Acute Stroke Therapy scheduled to be performed, and actually performed under conscious Sedation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"factors associated with a conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia","description":"recording of the procedures during anesthesia","timeFrame":"during therapy (day 1)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients undergoing thrombectomy for ischemic stroke\n* age â‰¥ 18 years old\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient already under general anesthesia\n* general sedation required\n* haemorrhagic softening diagnosed before the beginning of procedure\n* patient refusal to participate in the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Endovascular Acute Stroke Therapy scheduled to be performed with local sedation and either performed under General Anesthesia (case), either actually performed under conscious sedation (control).\n\nEndovascular Acute Stroke Therapy scheduled to be performed with conscious sedation and performed under General Anesthesia 3 control patients will be included per case, and matched with the moment of procedure (term of the year).","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild","city":"Paris","zip":"75019","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Acute Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7486","name":"Emergencies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M3797","name":"Anesthetics","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
