These 'wake up' strokes are defined as having no symptoms at sleep onset, but stroke symptoms on waking. The time of stroke onset is to be taken as the mid-point between sleep onset (or last known to be normal) and time of waking. The maximum time window for randomisation is then 9 hours from the mid-point as described.\n* Significant neurological deficit (eg. NIHSS score of ≥ 4 - 26) with clinical signs of hemispheric infarction.\n* Penumbral mismatch - A \"hypo-perfusion to core\" volume ratio of greater than 1.2, and an absolute difference greater than 10ml (using a Magnetic Resonance (MR) or Computed Tomography (CT) Tmax \\> 6 second delay), between perfusion lesion and MR-DWI or Computed Tomography-Cerebral Blood Flow (CT-CBF) core lesion.\n* An infarct core lesion of less than or equal to 70ml using MR-DWI or CT-CBF\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) identified by CT or MRI\n* Rapidly improving symptoms, particularly if in the judgment of the managing clinician that the improvement is likely to result in the patient having an NIHSS score of \\< 4 at randomization\n* Pre-stroke MRS score of ≥ 2 (indicating previous disability)\n* Contra indication to imaging with contrast agents\n* Infarct core \\>1/3 Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory qualitatively\n* Participation in any investigational study in the previous 30 days\n* Any terminal illness such that patient would not be expected to survive more than 1 year\n* Any condition that could impose hazards to the patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in the study (this applies to patients with severe microangiopathy such as haemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). The judgment is left to the discretion of the Investigator.\n* Pregnant women (clinically evident)\n* Previous stroke within last three months\n* Recent past history or clinical presentation of ICH, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), arterio-venous (AV) malformation, aneurysm, or cerebral neoplasm. At the discretion of each Investigator.\n* Current use of oral anticoagulants or a prolonged prothrombin time (INR \\> 1.7) if the patient is on warfarin\n* Use of heparin, except for low dose subcutaneous heparin, in the previous 48 hours and a prolonged activated thromboplastin time exceeding the upper limit of the local laboratory normal range.\n* Use of glycoprotein IIb - IIIa inhibitors within the past 72 hours. Use of single or dual agent oral platelet inhibitors (clopidogrel and/or low-dose aspirin) prior to study entry is permitted.\n* Clinically significant hypoglycaemia.\n* Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a blood pressure \\> 185 mmHg systolic or \\>110 mmHg diastolic on at least 2 separate occasions at least 10 minutes apart, or requiring aggressive treatment to reduce the blood pressure to within these limits. The definition of \"aggressive treatment\" is left to the discretion of the responsible Investigator.\n* Hereditary or acquired haemorrhagic diathesis\n* Gastrointestinal or urinary bleeding within the preceding 21 days\n* Major surgery within the preceding 14 days which poses risk in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Exposure to a thrombolytic agent within the previous 72 hours\n* Clinically deemed eligible for Endovascular Clot Retrieval (ECR) treatment by the treating team","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Geoffrey Donnan, MD FRACP","affiliation":"The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Stephen Davis, MD FRACP","affiliation":"University of Melbourne","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"China Medical University Hospital","city":"Taichung","zip":"40447","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":24.1469,"lon":120.6839}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34786868","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Bivard A, Churilov L, Ma H, Levi C, Campbell B, Yassi N, Meretoja A, Zhao H, Sharma G, Chen C, Davis S, Donnan G, Yan B, Parsons M; EXTEND investigators.
