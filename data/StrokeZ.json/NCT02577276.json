The first clinical assessment will involve introducing and familiarizing the participant with the study procedure, demonstrating and practicing with the system, and obtaining baseline clinical measures. During this first session the participant's technical skills and home equipment capabilities will be assessed and any assistance needed for establishing the technology in their home will be determined and provided. The second clinical assessment will include acquiring post-intervention clinical and outcome measures. Intervention duration will be 3 months. During the study period, each participant will receive online treatment for up to 45 minutes (in order to have net 30 min clinical time) twice per week. During these sessions, the clinician will teach system interaction including integrating feedback, instruct in system intervention activities and assure participant competence in system use, and adjust the level of difficulty in each activity according to the participant's abilities and needs. After the first month of intervention, the participant may be given permission by the therapist to train with the system for no more than 40 minutes per day. Such self-training opportunities are in addition to the twice weekly online sessions with the therapist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Paresis"],"keywords":["stroke","remote monitoring","hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tele-motion rehabilitation system","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Clinicians remotely monitor subjects' motor performance using Microsoft Kinect 3D sensor tracking system in their home to record their upper limb and trunk movements as they participate in a variety of functional tasks and motor activities, which are directed by their interaction with a monitor screen in their home using uniquely adapted software to integrate key rehabilitation intervention principles.","interventionNames":["Device: Tele-motion rehabilitation system"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Tele-motion rehabilitation system","description":"Tele-motion rehabilitation system: Interventions include functional therapeutic exercise and real-time feedback.
