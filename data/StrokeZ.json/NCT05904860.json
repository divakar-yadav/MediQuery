Both of these limitations have an ultimate effect in terms of increased risk of falls leading to augmented morbidity and mortality. Further results of gait abnormalities and balance impairments are increased morbidity with many other manifestations including but not limited to; pain, a significant reduction in quality of life, muscle as well as joint stiffness, postural instability self-imposed restricted physical functioning, and limited social interaction. The chances of an acute recurrent stroke are substantially increased due to restricted mobility.","detailedDescription":"A variety of treatment options are available for balance improvement and gait training in stroke patients including conventional treatment options of stretching, muscle strengthening, limb stabilization joint mobilizations followed by forward walking training with or without support and modern technological advancements including virtual reality immersion exercises, motor imagery and hydro treadmill. However, backward walking, also known as retro gait, is the emerging key therapy for gait training. Neuronal circuits located inside the spinal cord and brainstem; known as central pattern generators (CPGs), are primarily responsible for producing automated outputs for rhythmic motor responses example ambulation. These CPGs, along with the descending system, are responsible for motor neuron activation by setting the threshold muscle lengths. The CPGs that are responsible for forward ambulation, also regulate the backward gait. A more intensified recruitment of lower limb musculature motor unit has been observed during backward gait in individuals. Also, due to the restricted visual field when walking backward, the temporal and spatial gait parameters are significantly increased. For the aforementioned reasons, backward gait training can be used as an alternative strategy to improve balance and ambulation.\n\nThe performance of an individual during motor relearning can be influenced by using a stimulus from an external source that will generate a behavioral response leading to self-modification in motor action known as a biofeedback system. The most common types of biofeedback include visual, auditory as well as tactile stimuli that inform the individual involved in biofeedback training, about his relative achievements in reaching gait and balance-related targets. Recent literature proposes the notion that in a comparison of visual biofeedback versus auditory biofeedback, individuals under study are more prone to develop a dependence on external cues when using visual biofeedback. Also, poor performance was demonstrated by individuals receiving training with visual feedback on motor retention tests as compared to the individuals receiving auditory feedback. Thus auditory feedback tends to be more helpful in terms of motor relearning.\n\nBackward walking training activates the central pattern generators that are responsible for ambulation however, muscle fiber recruitment had been observed to be more intensified as compared to recruitment during forward gait training. Forward gait training with auditory biofeedback effectively improves stride length, balance, and walking speed in individuals with stroke.\n\nSince backward gait training has a more pronounced effect on gait parameters as compared to forward walking, also, in the light of recent evidence motor re-learning can be enhanced using biofeedback, the combined effect of backward gait training with auditory biofeedback could produce more pronounced effects in terms of motor recovery and improved balance and decreased risk of fall as compared to conventional forward gait training with biofeedback."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Stroke, Gait Training, Auditory feedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"total two groups are formed with 22 participants in each group.
