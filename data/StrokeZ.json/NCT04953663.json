Stem cells are a kind of pluripotent cells with the ability of self replication. The self-renewal and differentiation characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, as well as cytokine secretion effect and immune characteristics, provide the possibility for mesenchymal stem cells to treat ischemic stroke. After the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells, the secretion of soluble media including growth factors and cytokines may be the main mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of intravenous injection of ischemia tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic stroke. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ischemic tolerant human allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ischemic stroke patients with neurological dysfunction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"3 arms for phase 1, and 3 arms for pashe 2","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"0.5 × 10 \\^ 6 / kg (body weight) of it-hMSC per person","interventionNames":["Biological: it-hMSC"]},{"label":"Middle dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1 × 10 \\^ 6 / kg (body weight) of it-hMSC per person","interventionNames":["Biological: it-hMSC"]},{"label":"High dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 × 10 \\^ 6 / kg (body weight) of it-hMSC per person","interventionNames":["Biological: it-hMSC"]},{"label":"Highest dose cell group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Highest dose of it-hMSC","interventionNames":["Biological: it-hMSC"]},{"label":"Sub high dose cell group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sub high dose of it-hMSC","interventionNames":["Biological: it-hMSC"]},{"label":"placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"placebo","interventionNames":["Biological: it-hMSC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"it-hMSC","description":"Different doses of it-hMSC","armGroupLabels":["High dose group","Highest dose cell group","Low dose group","Middle dose group","Sub high dose cell group","placebo group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse events and serious adverse events rate","description":"Safety and tolerability of it-hMSC treatment","timeFrame":"In 12 months"},{"measure":"Rate of clinical significant changes in laboratory","description":"Safety and tolerability of it-hMSC treatment","timeFrame":"In 12 months"},{"measure":"Rate of abnormal neurological physical examination results","description":"Safety and tolerability of it-hMSC treatment","timeFrame":"In 12 months"},{"measure":"Rate of imaging changes","description":"Safety and tolerability of it-hMSC treatment","timeFrame":"In 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of NIHSS scores","description":"The improvement of neurological function was evaluated by neurological","timeFrame":"1、3、6、9、12 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Change of BI scores","description":"The improvement of neurological function was evaluated by neurological","timeFrame":"1、3、6、9、12 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Change of mRS scores","description":"The improvement of neurological function was evaluated by neurological","timeFrame":"1、3、6、9、12 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Change of MMSE scores","description":"The improvement of neurological function was evaluated by neurological","timeFrame":"1、3、6、9、12 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Change of GDS scores","description":"The improvement of neurological function was evaluated by neurological","timeFrame":"1、3、6、9、12 months after treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
