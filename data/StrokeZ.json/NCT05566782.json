Participants will be measured with accelerometers, tests in relation to physical function and qualitative interviews.","detailedDescription":"During and after hospitalization, patients with stroke are subjected to early rehabilitation starting at the hospital stay and continuing after discharge to a municipality. However, the continuity and adherence across sectors is challenged by different locations for the rehabilitation and time gaps from discharge to start in municipality.\n\nThis project focuses on the physical activity of patients with stroke measured with 3D accelerometry, the physical performance of the patients measured using the 30 second Chair Stand Test, balance measured with Bergs Balance Scale and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured with the 5-level version of European Quality of Life (EQ5D-5L). Furthermore, the patient perspectives and experiences with the rehabilitation plans are explored in semi-structured interviews at the end of the project.\n\nThe municipalities in Nordsjælland have been informed regarding the project and all their approvals have been collected prior to expected start in fall 2022. The heads of rehabilitation in the municipalities have approved participation in the research project with regards to follow-up of patients. The municipalities will support the data collection process with a therapist from each municipality working with quality control of the rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Neurological Rehabilitation","Patient Involvement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":117,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CRES-participants","description":"The participants in this cohort will start rehabilitation during their inhospital stay and continue the rehabilitation course during discharge to municipality.\n\nThe rehabilitation will consist of physical exercise and measurements in relation to accelerometry, physical function and qualitative interviews regarding goal for rehabilitation."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Physical activity measured by step counts and intensity minutes during the day (raw acceleration per time cycle)","description":"3D Accelerometers able to capture the daily physical activity performed by the participants in terms of intensity minutes and daily step counts (physiological parameter)","timeFrame":"10-14 days from hospital discharge til start of rehabilitation in municipality"},{"measure":"Change in physical function (30 second chair stand test)","description":"Tests performed during in hospital stay and at discharge and at start/end of rehabilitation","timeFrame":"At four timepoints during rehabilitation.
