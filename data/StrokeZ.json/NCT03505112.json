Radical cystectomy is a complex surgical procedure in which the bladder is removed, followed by urinary diversion. It is an extensive and time-consuming intervention and has high probability of fluid imbalance and bleeding during surgery. We hypothesized that the application of GDT in these patients would improve clinical postoperative outcomes. Therefore, we will attempt to evaluate improvement of postoperative outcomes after applying GDT protocol based on changes in stroke volume index, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure in radical cystectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bladder Cancer","Radical Cystectomy"],"keywords":["Goal-directed therapy","stroke volume index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":82,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Goal-directed therapy group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in goal-directed therapy (GDT) group will be managed according to the goal-directed therapy protocol during the surgery.","interventionNames":["Other: Goal-directed therapy"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The patients in control group will be managed according to standard perioperative care."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Goal-directed therapy","description":"The patients in GDT group will receive intravenous crystalloid fluid or vasopressor or inotropic agent according to the goal-directed therapy protocol utilizing FloTrac / EV1000 clinical platform (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA).\n\nAfter induction of anesthesia, the baseline stroke volume index (SVI) is measured and then 200-250 ml of crystalloid is administered over 5-10 minutes.
