The absolute change in Systolic blood pressure from baseline will also be calculated.\n\nThis study also aims in the evaluation of Framingham stroke risk profile score of patients treated with eprosartan under standard clinical practice conditions during the observation period. Besides the primary and the secondary objective of the study, the assessment of the percentage of patients who experienced Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADRs) (overall and per observed event) and the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment prematurely before the advent of the 6-month observation period due to toxicity to the study medication constitutes another important objective that is related to the safety of the treatment.","detailedDescription":"This is an open, non-interventional, non-comparative study. Therefore, there is no control group, randomization, or blinding involved. The target subject population is hypertensive patients who are being treated with eprosartan under standard clinical conditions and the locally approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs). Treatment selection is independent of the study conduct according to the local requirements of the Health Authorities for the definition of non-interventional studies being conducted in Greece. Therefore, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study follow the clinical decision of the participating physician, when prescribing the study medication(s) under standard clinical practice. The study plans to enroll 600 patients from 100 participating centers (hospitals and private physicians). This number includes an additional 25% cushion compared to the required sample size to ensure that sufficient data is collected for the subsequent statistical analysis. The study has been designed to be non-interventional and subsequently follows the per center standard practice of treatment, medical care and visits. As a result a rigid visit schedule could not be imposed. However, when taking into account the overall local standard practice, an overview of the visit schedule is indicated per subject:\n\n* A baseline visit at the beginning of the 6-month observation period where the investigator will check the eligibility of the subject and will record the baseline data provided that the subject is eligible and has given the signed and dated informed consent.\n* A final visit at the end of the 6-month treatment period (also observation period), and\n* At least one interim visit (according to the standard clinical practice, within baseline and final visit)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":533,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hypertensive patients","description":"All eligible hypertensive patients treated with eprosartan"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Percentage of Hypertensive Patients Who Achieve Regulated BP Levels According to the ESC/ESH Guidelines, After They Have Been Treated With Eprosartan for 6 Months Under Standard Daily Medical Practice Conditions.","description":"The percentage of hypertensive patients who achieve regulated BP levels according to the ESC/ESH (European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension) Guidelines, after they have been treated with eprosartan for 6 months under standard daily medical practice conditions.\n\nRate of responders (%) who reach the ESH/ESC Guidelines BP levels of \\<140 mmHg/90 mmHg \\[systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP)\\] for the general population of hypertensive patients OR of \\<130 mmHg/80 mmHg in case of diabetics and high or very high risk patients such as those with associated clinical conditions \\[stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease (CAD)\\]","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 6 months"},{"measure":"The Absolute Change in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline","description":"The absolute change in systolic Blood Pressure from baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Framingham Stroke Risk Profile Scores of the Participating Patients","description":"The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile assesses the Probability of Stroke Within 10 Years separately for a) Women Aged 55-84 Years and Free of Previous Stroke AND b) for Men Aged 55-85 Years and Free of Previous Stroke.\n\nFirst the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile Score is calculated as the sum of points obtained from each of the following factors: age, treated or untreated SBP, presence of diabetes, cigarette smoking, cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy according to the gender-specific tables provided by D'Agostino et al (Stroke 1994: 40-43).
