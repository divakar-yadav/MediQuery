Participants will be 1:1 randomized into anticoagulation alone or anticoagulation combined with antiplatelet therapy. The primary endpoint is composite events 3 months after enrollment.","detailedDescription":"Concomitant NVAF and extracranial/intracranial artery stenosis will greatly increase the risk of stroke, even with standard anticoagulation. However, clinicians may be concerned with the high risk of bleeding complications of anticoagulation combined with antiplatelet therapy. The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anticoagulation combined with antiplatelet therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with concomitant non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and extracranial/intracranial artery stenosis. Participants will be 1:1 randomized into anticoagulation alone or anticoagulation combined with antiplatelet therapy.
