The prismatic adaptation involves to pointing movements toward visual targets wearing prismatic glasses. These prismatic glasses induce a shift to the right visual field for improving symptoms in short term.\n\nTranscranial direct stimulation (tDCS) has been evaluated for different types of deficiency resulting from stroke with encouraging results. The hypothesis of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of brain stimulation as an adjunctive intervention to optimize and increase the rehabilitation of unilateral neglect to long-term.\n\nThus, the main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of standard treatment with prismatic adaptation with anodal tDCS or sham tDCS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Neglect Syndrome"],"keywords":["Neurologic neglect syndrome","post stroke","transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","prismatic adaptation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A Anodal tDCS and prismatic adaptation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex : stimulation intensity of 1mA during 20 minutes (5 consecutive sessions during one week).","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"Arm B: control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Prismatic adaptation with placebo stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: Control: placebo stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","description":"Anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex.
