The protocol includes a pre-test of the Italian version on ten patients, a final revision, and a validation on a sample of 60 stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study is aimed at providing an Italian version of two tools to assess participation in stroke patients, the Frenchay Activity Index (FAI) and the Walking Handicap Classification (WHC). These tools have been recently indicated for the assessment of participation in Stroke patients by the Italian Association of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (Minimal Stroke Assessment Protocol - PMIC2); they are currently used in Italian research and clinical settings, but no official translation exists. The process requires a standardized translation protocol, including forward and backward translation, using a multistep revision structure, to ensure conceptual and semantic equivalence. The validation process includes a pilot evaluation of on 10 individuals post-stroke admitted to the Neurological Rehabilitation Unit, Foundation Don Gnocchi Scientific Institute, and a validation on a sample of 60 stroke patients including reliability, internal consistency and concurrent validity assessment of the translated version against the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) - Italian version and the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) - Italian version, respectively"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae"],"keywords":["participation","Frenchay Activity Index","Walking Handicap Classification","Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"pre-test Group","description":"Consecutive recruitment of 10 post-stroke patients undergoing intensive rehabilitation treatment at the Neurological Rehabilitation Unit, Foundation don Gnocchi Scientific Institute.\n\nInclusion criteria: age 18-90, stroke occurred within 3 months from enrollment; clinical stability (SIC = 0).
