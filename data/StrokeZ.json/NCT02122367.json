Values derived from respiratory changes in arterial pressure waveform or plethysmographic waveform such as stroke volume variation and pleth variability index have been demonstrated to be able to predict fluid responsiveness in surgical or critically ill patients. Their ability to predict fluid responsiveness can be affected by factors that influence the arterial tone or the compliance of the respiratory system by position change. The aim of this prospective trial is to investigate the ability of stroke volume variation and pleth variability index to predict fluid responsiveness in the reverse trendelenberg position."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thyroidectomy","Fluid Responsiveness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke volume variation, pleth variability index","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke volume variation: recorded using the FloTrac/Vigileo system (Edwards Lifesciences)\n\npleth variability index: recorded using the Masimo Radical-7 monitor (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA)","interventionNames":["Other: HES 130/0.4 (VolulyteⓇ, Fresenius Kabi, Canada)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"HES 130/0.4 (VolulyteⓇ, Fresenius Kabi, Canada)","description":"HES 130/0.4 (VolulyteⓇ, Fresenius Kabi, Canada) 6ml/kg of ideal body weight loading","armGroupLabels":["stroke volume variation, pleth variability index"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke volume variation","timeFrame":"5 minutes after volume replacement"},{"measure":"pleth variability index","timeFrame":"5 minutes after volume replacement"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
