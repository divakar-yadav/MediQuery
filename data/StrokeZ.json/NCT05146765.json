For this study, participants will be instructed to use the speech therapy app for 30 minutes to 1 hour per day over a 4-week period.","detailedDescription":"A total of 40 patients with post-stroke dysarthria will be recruited and randomly divided into intervention and control groups.\n\nPatients in the intervention group will be instructed to receive speech treatments including oro-motor exercise, phonation, articulation, resonance, syllable repetition, and reading exercise (App on mobile devices). Daily sessions will be provided during a 4-week period. Both groups will also receive treatment as usual. The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of mobile-based speech therapy in patients with dysarthria in the acute phase following stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysarthria as Late Effect of Stroke"],"keywords":["Dysarthria","Stroke","digital therapeutics","Speech Disorders","Language Disorders","speech rehabilitation","application","Post-stroke dysarthria"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome Assessor","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will receive treatment as usual along with the speech therapy app.","interventionNames":["Device: Mobile application","Other: Treatment as usual"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group will receive treatment as usual only."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Mobile application","description":"Device: Use of mobile application Participants will be instructed to use the speech therapy app for 30 minutes to one hour per day over a 4-week period.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Treatment as usual","description":"The patients will follow the treatment as usual, including conventional stroke therapy if needed based on the medical guidelines.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Speech intelligibility","description":"Speech intelligibility is evaluated with a score of 0 (normal), 1 (intelligible, some differences noticeable), 2 (intelligible, noticeably different), 3 (intelligible with careful listening, some unintelligible), 4 (difficult to understand, many words unintelligible), 5 (usually unintelligible), or 6 (unintelligible).","timeFrame":"Baseline, 4weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The percent change in score on the Urimal Test of Articulation and Phonology 2 (UTAP2)","description":"he UTAP2, an essential tool for determining articulatory proficiency, will be employed to evaluate the Percentage of Consonants Correct (PCC), a crucial metric for identifying irregularities in articulation. Study participants will be instructed to read all 30 words from the UTAP2 word-level test. Following this, evaluators will calculate the PCC, expressed as a percentage, using the 94 consonants included in these words.
