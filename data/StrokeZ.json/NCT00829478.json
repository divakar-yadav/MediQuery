Different options carry with them different profiles of risks and benefits, and choosing the \"right\" therapy depends upon the patient's understanding of these risks and benefits and a consideration of the risks and benefits according to the patient's values and preferences. Studies have shown that patients' preferred therapy frequently disagrees with what is recommended by disease management guidelines.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine an intervention to improve the quality of decision-making for NVAF compared to usual care. The intervention has several components, including: a) educating the patient about why values and preferences are important to the decision-making process, b) providing an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits of each of the treatment options, c) exploring patients' values and preferences as they relate to the risks and benefits of each of the treatment options, d) preparing the patient to discuss his/her preferences with the physician."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","Cerebrovascular accident","Anticoagulation","Decision-making"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":135,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual Care","interventionNames":["Other: Usual Care"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Decision Aid for Atrial Fibrillation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Decision Aid for Atrial Fibrillation","description":"Single contact educational session","armGroupLabels":["2"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual Care","description":"Usual Care","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Decisional conflict","timeFrame":"Immediately following and 1-month post-intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Knowledge regarding atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"Immediately following study intervention and 1 month post-intervention"},{"measure":"Anxiety","timeFrame":"Immediately following intervention and 1 month post-intervention"},{"measure":"Changes in treatment plan for atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"Within 30 days post-intervention"},{"measure":"Quality of clinician-patient communication","timeFrame":"Clinician visit immediately post-intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 45 years or older\n* Be scheduled to see primary Doctor at VA\n* Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation\n* English speaking\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have valvular disease as the cause of Afib\n* Be on warfarin for a condition other than NVAF\n* Have a contraindication to warfin\n* Have a contraindication to ASA\n* Life expectancy of less than 12 months\n* Cognitive impairment\n* Receiving anti-platelet agent other than aspirin\n* Receiving care in a supervised resident clinic or from an attending physician who refuses participation in the study\n* Bleed with identified source in the last 12 months\n* Bleed with an unidentified source\n* History of intracerebral hemorrhage\n* Severe hearing impairment\n* Severe visual impairment","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Terri R Fried, M.D.","affiliation":"VA Connecticut HS","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System - West Haven Campus","city":"West Haven","state":"Connecticut","zip":"06516","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.27065,"lon":-72.94705}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
