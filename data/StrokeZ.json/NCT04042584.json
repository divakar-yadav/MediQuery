Clinical identification of type of treatment is needed is pre-hospital triage of these patients.","detailedDescription":"The outcome of ischemic stroke (IS) with large artery occlusion (LVO) is related to the volume of infarcted brain witch is related to the delay of arterial recanalisation. IVT is available in multiple stroke units in France but, in case of LVO, the association with TM is needed. The availability of endovascular capable centers is limited to tertiary care hospitals. As a result, pre-hospital identification of these patients is a priority and the optimization of the triage can be done by a clinical algorithm carried out by a neurological tele-evaluation.\n\nOPTIC-AVC is a multi-phase study. This phase is about the evaluation of accuracy of our algorithm performed by a quick and standardized neurological tele-evaluation to predict the eligibility for recanalisation treatment (IVT and/or TM) of patients suspected of acute stroke in the emergency setting. The effective therapeutic decision for each patient, performed by another neurologist, will be blind to the theoretical therapeutic decision resulting from the algorithm.\n\nTheoretical and effective therapeutic decision will be compared a posteriori"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Stroke","Mechanical thrombectomy","Tele-evaluation","Emergency medical service","Pre hospital"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":215,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Visio conference device evaluation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neurological tele-evaluation by a neurologist","interventionNames":["Procedure: Visio conference device evaluation (DVCM)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Visio conference device evaluation (DVCM)","description":"Standard neurological tele-evaluation (limited to 15minutes) remotely carried out by a first neurologist via a tablet (DVCM) and an operator.
