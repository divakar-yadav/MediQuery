Different tracking techniques are used to locate a proper injection spot. Palpatory technique is barely effective and induces a high risk of error. Localization by electro stimulation is frequently used in adults, but often requires multiple painful repositioning of the needle. Ultrasound tracking is sometimes used in children but not much in adults.\n\nThe advantages of ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin injections are a painless localization and greater injection accuracy. Safety is therefore enhanced since intravascular injection is easily avoided.\n\nThe few existing publications on the subject are essentially case reports. Few studies have focused on comparing different injection techniques and so far, no well-conducted study has highlighted superior efficiency of ultrasound-guided injections.","detailedDescription":"Objectives:\n\nThe main objective is to compare the efficiency of botulinum toxin injections depending on the localization technique: ultrasound vs. electrical stimulation.\n\nThe secondary objective is to demonstrate less painful localization associated to ultrasound-guidance.\n\nEvaluations:\n\nThe primary endpoint is the variation of passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion at slow speed and high speed (\"Tardieu scale\") while keeping knee straight.\n\nThe secondary endpoints are:\n\n* The other components of the \"Tardieu scale\": quality of muscle reaction (X) at slow speed and fast speed, angle of apparition of the muscle reaction (Y) at slow speed and fast speed.\n* Assessment of spasticity of the triceps surae on the modified Ashworth scale.\n* The walking speed.\n* The extent of pain at the injection site by visual analogue scale.\n* The duration of tracking and injection.\n\nMethodology:\n\nThis prospective, randomized, single-center, single-blind, cross-over, study will be conducted in chronic stroke patients with spasticity of the triceps surae.\n\nPatients will receive two injections during the protocol, each with a different technique of localization. Randomization will determine which technique will be used in the first and the second place.\n\nPatients will be selected from the cohort of patients supported by consultation of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand. Injections of botulinum toxin and assessments will take place in the same department.\n\nThe study period is five months for each patient. This study does not present a major risk for the subjects. The main inconvenience is injection pain or side effects of botulinum toxin (increase of motor deficits or dysphagia)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Botulinum Toxin","Ultrasound-guidance","Stroke","Spasticity","Ultrasonography","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"botulinum toxin injections","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The main objective is to compare the efficiency of botulinum toxin injections depending on the localization technique: ultrasound vs. electrical stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: Botulinum toxin injection"]},{"label":"ultrasound guidance","type":"OTHER","description":"The secondary objective is to demonstrate less painful localization associated to ultrasound-guidance","interventionNames":["Device: Botulinum toxin injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Botulinum toxin injection","armGroupLabels":["botulinum toxin injections","ultrasound guidance"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion (Tardieu scale) while keeping knee straight","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion (Tardieu scale) while keeping knee straight","timeFrame":"at day 1 (first injection)"},{"measure":"Passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion (Tardieu scale) while keeping knee straight","timeFrame":"at day 60"},{"measure":"Passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion (Tardieu scale) while keeping knee straight","timeFrame":"at day 120 (second injection)"},{"measure":"Passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion (Tardieu scale) while keeping knee straight","timeFrame":"at day 150"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tardieu scale: quality of muscle reaction at slow speed and fast speed","timeFrame":"at Inclusion, D1, D60, D120 and D150"},{"measure":"Angle of apparition of the muscle reaction at slow speed and fast speed","timeFrame":"at Inclusion, D1, D60, D120 and D150"},{"measure":"Spasticity of the triceps surae on the modified Ashworth scale","timeFrame":"at Inclusion, D1, D60, D120 and D150"},{"measure":"Walking speed","timeFrame":"at Inclusion, D1, D60, D120 and D150"},{"measure":"Extent of pain at the injection site by visual analogue scale","timeFrame":"at D1, D120"},{"measure":"Duration of tracking and injection","timeFrame":"at D1, D120"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 to 80 years.\n* Hemiplegia sequelae of stroke\n* Spasticity of the triceps surae listed at least 1 + / 4 on the modified Ashworth scale\n* Ability to give written consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Injection of botulinum toxin older than 3 months\n* Patient who has already received ultrasound-guided injection of botulinum toxin\n* Indication of botulinum toxin injection in other muscle groups in the lower limb than triceps surae\n* Swallowing impairment\n* Ongoing AVK anticoagulation treatment with INR greater than 3 during one week before randomization.\n* Ongoing treatment by aminoglycosides\n* General anesthesia with injection of curare planned during the participation in the protocol\n* Wearing a pacemaker\n* History of ankle arthrodesis\n* Other cons-indication for botulinum toxin injection: myasthenia gravis, pregnancy, lactation.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Isabelle HAURET","affiliation":"University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Clermont-Ferrand","city":"Clermont-Ferrand","zip":"63003","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.77966,"lon":3.08628}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"27852706","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Morel C, Hauret I, Andant N, Bonnin A, Pereira B, Coudeyre E.
