These last years, it has been proven that the solicitation of a muscle using vibrations may lead to positive effects on the neuromuscular function. Thus, the aim of the current study is to assess if the addition to a standard rehabilitation program of local vibrations sessions of the dorsiflexor muscles of the paretic limb of stroke patients may allow a better recovery of walking speed (primary outcome). One group using vibrations (i.e. experimental group) and one group with sham vibration (i.e. control group) will take part to this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Local vibration","Stroke","Motor recovery","Walking speed","Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vibration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke patients in subacute rehabilitation phase will be included.
