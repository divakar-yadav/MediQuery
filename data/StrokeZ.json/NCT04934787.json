With the assistance of the ENMS-BSF the foot drop and foot inversion could be corrected with improved muscle coordination in the paretic lower limb. The device is wearable and light-in-weight for unilateral application during walking. It is hypothesized that with the intervention of the ENMS-BSF the gait pattern of persons after stroke can be improved with long-term rehabilitative effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke","Foot Drop","Foot Inversion Deformity"],"keywords":["Robot","Stroke","Lower limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ENMS-BSF assisted gait training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will receive the full assistance of the ENMS-BSF during a 20-session gait rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Device: ENMS-BSF assisted gait training"]},{"label":"Partial ENMS-BSF assisted gait training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The participants will receive a partial assistance of the ENMS-BSF during a 20-session gait rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Device: ENMS-BSF assisted gait training"]},{"label":"Sham ENMS-BSF assisted gait training","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The participants will only wear the device without assistance during a 20-session gait rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Device: ENMS-BSF assisted gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ENMS-BSF assisted gait training","description":"1.
