Alfimeprase acts to degrade fibrin directly and is inactivated locally by circulating alpha-2 macroglobulin. This study will determine whether treatment with alfimeprase facilitates rapid restoration of arterial blood flow with avoidance of symptomatic hemorrhagic conversion in subjects with AIS within 3 to 9 hours of symptom onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["AIS","acute ischemic stroke","stroke","alfimeprase","blood clot","brain","thrombus","thrombolytic","thrombosis","plasminogen activator","arterial flow","neurology","intra-arterial","intra-thrombus","catheter-directed","symptomatic ICH","ICH","AOL","arterial occlusive lesion","recanalization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"2 stages","type":"OTHER","description":"This is a two-stage study.
