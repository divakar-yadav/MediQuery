These results have the potential to:\n\n1. Change care delivery\n2. Improve health outcomes\n3. Improve the experiences of young adult transition to adult care","detailedDescription":"Transition is the purposeful, planned movement of adolescent and young adults with chronic health conditions from child-centered to adult-oriented health systems. Transition includes, but is not limited to transfer to adult care. Transfer of care, which occurs during a vulnerable developmental period around age 18 introduces gaps in continuity of care that can lead to detrimental health outcomes in young adults. Therefore, provision of coordinated and developmentally appropriate care during the transition period is necessary to maintain health and to sustain investments made in pediatric health care.\n\nClinical practice guidelines for transition to adult care recommend the use of patient navigators to coordinate the entry of patients into a complex and unfamiliar adult health care system. Patient navigators provide individualized supports to facilitate medical follow-up and adherence. A limited number of studies have shown that access to a patient navigator during transition decreases drop-out from medical care and disease specific adverse events. No study to date has evaluated the benefits of a patient navigator to improve patient and or health system outcomes, when implemented across multiple chronic disease settings.\n\nObjectives/Methods\n\n1. to evaluate the impact of a patient navigator intervention compared to treatment as usual for 16 to 21 year olds living with chronic health conditions who are transferring to adult care with respect to healthcare utilization and patient reported outcomes\n2. to obtain perceptions of stakeholders regarding the role of patient navigators in reducing barriers to adult-oriented ambulatory care\n3. to determine the net health care cost impact attributable to the navigator intervention\n\nA qualitative study sampling participants randomized into the intervention arm at the beginning and end of the trial will also be undertaken to understand the patient experience."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Endocrine System Diseases","Gastro-Intestinal Disorder","Neuro-Degenerative Disease","Epilepsy","Autoimmune Diseases","Renal Disease","Cardiac Disease","Metabolic Disease","Genetic Diseases, Inborn","Respiratory Disease","Hematologic Diseases","Autism Spectrum Disorder","Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["transition, young adults, transfer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups of participants will be randomized by primary clinical area","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":337,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient Navigator Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient Navigator (Social Worker) will assist youth adapt and attach to adult delivered healthcare for up to 24 months.\n\nParticipants will receive 5 issues of a provincial generic newsletter on topics around transition.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete a health questionnaire at baseline and 4 more times during 24 months.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete a transition readiness questionnaire at baseline and 4 more times during 24 months.\n\nParticipants will be provided the opportunity to journal online about their experiences.\n\nUp to 100 participants will be provided the opportunity to be interviewed at baseline and end of study about their transition experience.","interventionNames":["Other: Patient Navigator"]},{"label":"Usual Care Arm","type":"OTHER","description":"Youth will receive usual care from their pediatric clinics in preparation and transfer to adult care.\n\nParticipants will receive 5 issues of a provincial generic newsletter on topics around transition.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete a health questionnaire at baseline and 4 more times during 24 months.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete a transition readiness questionnaire at baseline and 4 more times during 24 months.\n\nParticipants will be provided the opportunity to journal online about their experiences.","interventionNames":["Other: Usual Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Patient Navigator","description":"Social worker/Patient Navigator will be assigned to follow youth in adult care for up to 24 months to assist youth adapt and attach to adult delivered healthcare","armGroupLabels":["Patient Navigator Arm"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual Care","description":"Whatever processes are in place in a variety of clinics to support transfer from pediatric to adult care in the pediatric clinics","armGroupLabels":["Usual Care Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Health services utilization","description":"verification of health services utilized by up to 600 participants collected via personal health numbers (e.g. National Ambulatory Care Reporting System;
