In the recent years, endovascular therapy is demonstrated to be effective to treat ischemic with big vessel occlusion. However, only a minority of patients can get intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular therapy due to the restricted time window and strict indications. Dual antiplatelet has been demonstrated to be effective in the patients with high risk of TIA or minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS\\<4). But there is still stroke progression although dual antiplatelet. The ischemic stroke patients with NIHSS \\> 3 has been recommended to give aspirin in most guidelines. Of those patients, mild to moderate stroke patients (3\\<NIHSS\\<10) will result in the poor outcomes if the progression occurs. In addition, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke is prone to progress. So, we argue that the mild to moderate stroke with LAA should be give more intensive antiplatelet. In the present study, argatroban combined with antiplatelet therapy (3-5 days) is used to treat the proposed patients to investigate the safety and effectiveness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Argatroban combined with antiplatelet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Argatroban plus dual antiplatelet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Argatroban plus dual antiplatelet","description":"A continuous argatroban infusion of 1.0 ug/kg per minute for 2-5 days adjusted to a target activated partial thromboplastin time of 1.75 X baseline (about 10%).
