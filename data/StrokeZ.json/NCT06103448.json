Putting acquired data in correlation to their work habits, type of employment, work demands, job type, activity levels. Trying to find common predictors of cardiovascular disease. All assessed subjects must understand written and spoken Czech, must be employed in a company that consents with our data collections, must be older than 18 year old, doesn't have any bleeding disorder, doesn't have deep vein thrombosis (as it produces inaccurate data with ankle brachial index). Study will be conducted in Ustecky Region in the Czech Republic on approximately 200 subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Morbidity","Stroke","Embolism","Cardiac Arrest"],"keywords":["ankle-brachial index","cardiovascular mortality","prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Ankle-brachial index - system 100","description":"Measurement of ankle brachial index on all four limbs, drawing three blood drops for point of care (POC) cholesterol meter and one drop of blood for POC glucometer","otherNames":["Point of care cholesterol meter by Lux and point of care Glucometers"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of glycemia, HDL, LDL and triacylglyceride levels","description":"Glycemia, HDL, LDL and triacylglyceride levels (mmol/l) will be measured from drops of blood by point-of-care analysers","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"Body composition","description":"Using body composition scale the following markers will be counted: bone mass, body fat, muscle mass, water levels.
