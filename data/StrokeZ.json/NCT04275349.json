Xingnaojing injection is the only essential traditional chinese medicine on emergency ambulance used for acute stroke.The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Xingnaojing used for acute stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset on ambulance will improve the Early neurological deterioration of acute stroke at 3 days. All suspected acute stroke participants will be registered once they are taken on the ambulance. The primary outcome will be determined at 3 days.Besides, there will be a quantitative interview with emergency doctors about their knowledge and attitude on Xingnaojing for acute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Registry","Cohort study","Mixed methods","Prehospital","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exposure group(continuously)","description":"xingnaojing injection will be intravenously administered within 24 hours of symptom onset until to third day (from prehospital ambulance to hospital or at hospital)","interventionNames":["Drug: Xingnaojing injection within 24 hours of symptom onset"]},{"label":"Exposure group(uncontinuously)","description":"xingnaojing injection will be intravenously administered within 24 hours of symptom onset for once (on prehospital ambulance )","interventionNames":["Drug: Xingnaojing injection within 24 hours of symptom onset"]},{"label":"Completely unexposed group","description":"xingnaojing injection will not be intravenously administered within 24 hours of symptom onset until to third day (from prehospital ambulance to hospital)"},{"label":"Incompletely unexposed group","description":"xingnaojing injection will not be intravenously administered on ambulance but administered more than 24 hours of symptom onset at hospital"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Xingnaojing injection within 24 hours of symptom onset","description":"intravenously administered Xingnaojing injection within 24 hours of symptom onset on ambulance or at hospital","armGroupLabels":["Exposure group(continuously)","Exposure group(uncontinuously)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early neurological deterioration（change between baseline and 3 days)","description":"The early neurologic deterioration is defined as an increase of 1 points or more in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score between baseline and 3 days.
