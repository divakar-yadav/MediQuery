Blood flow measurement is critical for vasospasm, stroke, and embolism monitoring on patients in the ICU or understanding the neurovascular coupling on different subjects. Currently, A conventional transcranial Doppler (TCD) probe is widely used for these applications. A headset design must be applied and fixed on the participants to obtain stable blood flow spectra. However, the TCD headset is operator dependent. The operator needs to be a trained expert and hold the ultrasound probe to get accurate blood flow velocity information. The stretchable and wearable non-invasive ultrasonic patch can not only free the operator's hands but can also provide long-term continuous monitoring, which is not possible by using the current operator-dependent ultrasound machine. The device can be conformal to the skin and attached to the skin surface."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Medical Device Complication","Brain Injuries","Brain Diseases","Stroke","Vasospasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Blood flow monitoring in the brain","description":"A group/cohort of 60 participants will be recruited.
