The study will be a prospective randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design). 150 patients will be randomized to nVNS with the gammaCore Sapphire™ device on top of best medical practice versus best medical practice alone (including intravenous thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy if indicated). If patients are randomized to nVNS, two stimulations of two minutes each will be applied in the neck every 15 minutes in the first 3 hours. Thereafter two stimulations will be applied every 8 hours over the next 5 days or until discharge, whichever occurs first. The stimulation side in the neck will be the radiological side of the stroke. The primary endpoint will be the final infarct volume on MRI scan on day 5 of patients treated with nVNS compared with those of patients not treated with VNS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Brain infarction","Brain ischemia","Vagus nerve stimulation","Penumbra"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"PROBE design","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation on top of best medical practice","interventionNames":["Device: non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulator"]},{"label":"Standard Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Best medical practice alone"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulator","description":"Two stimulations of two minutes each will be applied in the neck every 15 minutes in the first 3 hours.
