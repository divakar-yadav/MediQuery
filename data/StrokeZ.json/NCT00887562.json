Seizures, cognitive deterioration, and neurobehavioral abnormalities are frequent features of this disease which typically shortens life expectancy. Idebenone, an ATP production modulator and antioxidant, improves neurological function in Friedreich's ataxia, a disease also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nGiven that there is no effective treatment for MELAS, the investigators propose a Phase II proof of concept trial of idebenone to study its preliminary efficacy in patients with MELAS and the A3243G mtDNA mutation, and to study its safety and tolerability in this patient group.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate 21 patients with the A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation and MELAS (defined by a history of either seizures or stroke). Patients will receive idebenone (900 mg/day or 2250 mg/day) or matching placebo for one month. The primary outcome measure is cerebral lactate levels measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), a biomarker associated with disease worsening. This study will help the investigators to determine if there is sufficient signal to proceed to efficacy studies. Also it will provide additional information on the safety and tolerability of two different doses of idebenone in MELAS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["MELAS Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Idebenone 900 mg/day","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Idebenone 900 mg/day","interventionNames":["Drug: Idebenone"]},{"label":"Idebenone 2250 mg/day","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Idebenone 2250 mg/day","interventionNames":["Drug: Idebenone"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Idebenone","description":"900 mg/day for 1 month","armGroupLabels":["Idebenone 900 mg/day"],"otherNames":["active drug"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Idebenone","description":"2250 mg/day for 1 month","armGroupLabels":["Idebenone 2250 mg/day"],"otherNames":["active drug"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo - No idebenone","armGroupLabels":["placebo"],"otherNames":["No active drug"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Change in Cerebral Lactate Concentration (as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy)","description":"To compare the efficacy of 1 month treatment with 2 different doses of idebenone with that of placebo on cerebral lactate concentration as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)","timeFrame":"Up to 4 weeks from baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Change in Venous Lactate Concentration","description":"To compare the efficacy of 1 month treatment with 2 different doses of idebenone with that of placebo on venous lactate concentration","timeFrame":"Up to 4 weeks from baseline"},{"measure":"Mean Change in Score on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)","description":"To assess changes following 1 month treatment with 2 different doses of idebenone with that of placebo in fatigue as assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).\n\nScale score minimum is 9 (least fatigue) and maximum is 63 (maximum fatigue).
