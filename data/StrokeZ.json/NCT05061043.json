Add up the score for each of the twenty-one questions by counting the number to the right of each question you marked. The highest possible total for the whole test would be sixty-three. This would mean you circled number three on all twenty-one questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the lowest possible score for the test would be zero. This would mean you circles zero on each question.\n\nLevels of Depression scoring criteria:\n\n1-10 (These ups and downs are considered normal) 11-16 (Mild mood disturbance) 17-20 (Borderline clinical depression) 21-30 (Moderate depression) 31-40 (Severe depression) over 40 (Extreme depression)","timeFrame":"120 days"},{"measure":"Overall self-sufficiency","description":"Overallself-sufficiency will be assessed via questionnaire by barthel with determination of barthel index23. The Barthel Scale/Index is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living .\n\nTen variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge.Time taken and physical assistance required to perform each item are used in determining the assigned value of each item. The Barthel Index measures the degree of assistance required by an individual on 10 items of mobility and self care ADL. The Barthel includes 10 personal activities: feeding, personal toileting, bathing, dressing and undressing, getting on and off a toilet, controlling bladder, controlling bowel, moving from wheelchair to bed and returning, walking on level surface (or propelling a wheelchair if unable to walk) and ascending and descending stairs.","timeFrame":"120 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Both Gender\n* Age (Years) 40-70\n* Subacute stage of a strok\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- Trauma (e.g., temporal bone fracture)\n\n* Infection\n* Herpes zoster (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)\n* Borreliosis (Lyme disease)\n* HSV reactivation\n* HIV\n* Tumors (esp. parotid gland tumors)\n* Pregnancy\n* Diabetes mellitus\n* Guillain-Barr√© syndrome\n* Sarcoidosis\n* Amyloidosis\n* Stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"MANAHIL ZARAR, MS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03244250061","email":"manahilzrar52@gmail.com"},{"name":"Janat zarar","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03224947914","email":"manahilzrar52@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Manahil zarar, MS","affiliation":"University of Lahore","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Physiotherapy department Wapda Hospital complex, Lahore","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Lahore","state":"Punjab","zip":"54770","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":31.558,"lon":74.35071}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21174055","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Konecny P, Elfmark M, Urbanek K.
