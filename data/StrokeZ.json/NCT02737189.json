This has led to a broad adoption of these techniques which are now considered standard of care in many institutions despite the lack of adequate evidence to prove their benefit. Indeed, the rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in these studies have consistently been around 5% which raises the question as to whether patients could actually be harmed as opposed to helped by these procedures. This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, open, blinded-endpoint trial, with the aim to evaluate the hypothesis that mechanical embolectomy with the Solitaire device is superior to medical management alone in achieving better outcomes in subjects presenting with an acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the basilar artery within 6-24 hours from symptom onset.","detailedDescription":"Study Objective: To evaluate the hypothesis that mechanical embolectomy with the Solitaire device is superior to medical management alone in achieving favourable outcomes defined as modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-3 at 90 days in subjects presenting with ischemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion up to 24 hours from symptom onset.\n\nSubject Population: Subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 6-24 hours from symptom onset/last seen well and whose strokes are attributable to an occlusion of the basilar artery. Subjects are either ineligible for IV alteplase or have received IV alteplase therapy without recanalization. The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of mechanical embolectomy with Solitaire stentriever in conjunction with manual aspiration versus medical management alone. Randomization will be done under a stratification process using age, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and therapeutic window. For the primary endpoint, subjects will be followed for 90 days post-randomization.Sample size is projected to be 318 patients.\n\nCare providers: Vascular neurologists and trained interventional neuroradiologists or neurologists in certified comprehensive stroke centers that treat more than 500 acute stroke patients and perform more than 30 acute mechanical thrombectomies every year will treat patients. Neurointerventionalists have to have previously performed at least 10 thrombectomies with Solitaire device in acute ischemic stroke patients.\n\nInterventions: Patients in both arms will be admitted at acute stroke units (or Intensive Care Unit if needed) and treated following the Chinese Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke. Concomitant medications and non-pharmacological therapies will be recorded. If a decision of stopping support life measures is adopted, this will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).A maximum of six attempts to retrieve the thrombus in a single vessel can be made with any Solitaire device or aspiration. In case an atherosclerotic lesion is found underlying the occlusive lesion angioplasty/stenting through detachment of the Solitaire device will be allowed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Occlusion","Ischemic Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Basilar Artery Occlusion","Ischemic Stroke","Mechanical Embolectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":217,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical embolectomy with Solitaire stentriever in conjunction with manual aspiration\n\nBest Medical Treatment and maximum supportive care","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical embolectomy","Drug: Medical Treatment"]},{"label":"Control Arm","type":"OTHER","description":"Best Medical Treatment and maximum supportive care, not including mechanical thrombectomy, no intra arterial treatment","interventionNames":["Drug: Medical Treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mechanical embolectomy","description":"Mechanical embolectomy with Solitaire stentriever in conjunction with manual aspiration","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular Arm"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Medical Treatment","description":"Best Medical Treatment and maximum supportive care, not including mechanical thrombectomy, no intra arterial treatment","armGroupLabels":["Control Arm","Endovascular Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"proportion of patients achieving favourable outcomes defined as mRS 0-3 at 90 days","description":"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that mechanical embolectomy with the Solitaire device is superior to medical management alone in achieving favourable outcomes (mRS ≤ 3) at 90 days in subjects presenting with an acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the basilar artery within 6-24 hours from symptom onset.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dramatic early favorable response","description":"Dramatic early favorable response as determined by an National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) of 0-2 or NIHSS improvement ≥ 8 points at 24 (-2/+12) hours.","timeFrame":"24 (-2/+12) hours"},{"measure":"Dichotomized mRS score (0-2 versus 3-6 and 0-4 versus 5-6 )","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients achieving meaningful outcomes defined as mRS 0-4 at 12 months.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Final infarct volume and the change of infarct volume compared with baseline","description":"Infarct volume evaluated on Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) at 24 hours (-2/+12 hours)","timeFrame":"24 hours (-2/+12 hours)"},{"measure":"Vessel recanalization with Arterial Occlusive Lesion (AOL) grades","description":"Vessel recanalization at 24 hours (-2/+12 hours) in both treatment groups assessed by using Arterial Occlusive Lesion (AOL) grades","timeFrame":"24 hours (-2/+12 hours)"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Score (mRS)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Barthel Index","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"NIHSS","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Quality of life analysis","description":"Quality of life analysis as measured by EuroQol/EQ5D and SF-36 at 3 month, 6 months and 1 year, between interventional therapy vs medical therapy alone","timeFrame":"3 month, 6 months and 1 year"},{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"at 90 days"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage （SICH）","timeFrame":"24 (-2/+12) hours"},{"measure":"Serious Adverse Events","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognition Test (MOCA)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Immediate Post-Endovascular Treatment Recanalization (for the Solitaire arm only)","description":"Successful recanalization is defined as TICI (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) 2b or 3 in the post-procedure angiography.","timeFrame":"Immediate Post-Endovascular Treatment"},{"measure":"Procedural related complications","description":"arterial perforation, arterial dissection, embolization in a previously uninvolved vascular territory and so on.","timeFrame":"Perioperative period"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
