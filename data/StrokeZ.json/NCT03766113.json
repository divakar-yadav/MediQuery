Recent studies have revealed the potential of combining EEG and fMRI to achieve a more efficient and specific self-regulation, which may be critical in clinical applications.\n\nThe aim of this study is to optimize the neurofeedback method coupling EEG and fMRI in healthy subjects then to evaluate the effect of an EEG-NF and a neurofeedback coupling EEG and fMRI versus motor imagery on recovery in the early and chronic stage after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Neurofeedback ;
