The study will be unicentric however there is the possibility of incorporating new stroke centers with previous experience of at least 50 DTAS cases.\n\nThe RACE scale (Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation) will be used as a prehospital screening tool to identify acute stroke patients with suspicion of LVO. Once prenotifying the imminent arrival and the verified inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Neurologist at arrival, the patient will be randomized by an app in one of both study protocols.\n\nSubjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Endovascular treatment","Large Vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":174,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Direct Transfer to Angio Suite","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"After a fast neurological evaluation, patient will be direct transferred to angiography suite where endovascular treatment (EVT) team will be waiting for it.
