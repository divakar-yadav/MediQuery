The study will enroll approximately 52 subjects and will be followed through 12 months.","detailedDescription":"Standard intraprocedural guidance for transcatheter left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) employs a multi-modality integrated approach combining fluoroscopy for guiding the delivery system, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for intracardiac characterization to guide device selection and monitor procedural complications. Successful implantation of the device is confirmed with contrast-enhanced fluoroscopy and color doppler flow imaging on TEE. TEE is the current gold standard for procedural guidance but requires general anesthesia (GA) to avoid patient motion and discomfort during the procedure. General anesthesia, however, is associated with pulmonary complications and patient discomfort due to endotracheal intubation. Intraprocedural LAAC guidance under local anesthesia or conscious sedation might help mitigate these GA-related disadvantages and has motivated multiple clinical studies, establishing intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) as a safe and feasible alternative to TEE.\n\nThe new generation of NuVision ICE catheter offers a larger imaging volume of 90° x 90° with multiplanar reformatted (MPR) echo views for better visualization of anatomical landmarks and procedural guidance and aid in sizing of the device. This has a potential to improve outcomes and reduce procedure times while lowering healthcare costs.\n\nIn this study, Role of NuVision Intracardiac Echocardiographic (ICE) catheter with Tranesopheal echocardiography (TEE) in predicting intra-procedural outcomes and success of implantation in patients undergoing left atrial appendage occlusion will be assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1 - TEE Primary imaging guidance","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TEE is the primary imaging guidance with 4D ICE is the secondary","interventionNames":["Device: Imaging guidance with TEE and ICE for Left atrial appendage closure"]},{"label":"Arm 2 - ICE Primary Imaging Guidance","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"4D ICE is the primary imaging guidance and TEE is the secondary","interventionNames":["Device: Imaging guidance with TEE and ICE for Left atrial appendage closure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Imaging guidance with TEE and ICE for Left atrial appendage closure","description":"The occluder size for both LAAC devices will be selected based on the maximal diameter of the LAA orifice following the manufacturer guidelines and using the maximal length of the LAA measured on Echocardiogram.
