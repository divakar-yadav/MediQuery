The randomized controlled trial will recruit the stroke patients will be selected and randomly divided into two groups: Group A (unilateral training group (UTG)) and Group B (bilateral training group (BTG)).\n\nPatients in Group A will undergo approach-oriented training using the motor relearning program (MRP) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) for the affected side, while those in Group B underwent strength training for the lower-limb muscles using Delorme's principle for the unaffected side and approach-oriented training using the MRP and PNF for the affected side for a period of six weeks, five days per week. A strengthening regimen will designed for the unaffected side, considering the frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITTs) principle provided by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The static and dynamic balance along with gait parameters will measure using the functional reach test (FRT), one-leg stance test (OLST), Berg balance scale (BBS) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), gait parameters (stride length, gait velocity, and cadence), and Brunnstrom recovery stages (BRS) at the baseline and post rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Balance; Distorted","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["Stroke, Ischemic","Balance; Distorted","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"patients will be allocated to intervention groups by randomization Patients in group A will be given MRP and PNF techniques to involve side Patients In group B will be given exercises same as above but on unaffected side.The strengthening exercises also given to this group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In this group stroke patients will be undergone task-oriented approach using motor relearning program (MRP) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) for the hemi-paretic side","interventionNames":["Other: Unilateral training group (UTG)"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this group stroke patients will be undergone strength training using frequency, intensity, type, time (FITT) principle to non-hemi-paretic side and task-oriented approach using motor relearning program (MRP) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) to hemi-paretic side","interventionNames":["Other: Bilateral training group (BTG)."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Unilateral training group (UTG)","description":"stroke patients will be undergone task-oriented approach using motor relearning program (MRP) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) for the hemi-paretic side","armGroupLabels":["experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bilateral training group (BTG).","description":"stroke patients will be undergone strength training using frequency, intensity, type, time (FITT) principle to non-hemi-paretic side and task-oriented approach using motor relearning program (MRP) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) to hemi-paretic side","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional reach test (FRT):","description":"Functional reach test (FRT):\n\nIt is clinical outcome measure tool for ascertaining dynamic balance in one task.
