It is considered that stroke may be related to altered hemodynamics, blood stasis and fibrin-based clot embolization mechanisms in the distal carotid web. Radiologically, in DSA and CTA, there is a thin membrane-like intraluminal filling defect extending along the posterior carotid wall in oblique-sagittal sections and a corresponding defect in axial sections.\n\nIt is seen as a thin septum; There is no study on its classification in the literature. Determination of the incidence of carotid web, determination of its relationship with ischemic stroke / TİA, Facilitating distinctions such as dissection etc. by making radiological classification is important in terms of increasing awareness on this issue and early diagnosis. Demonstrating the relationship between carotid webs, which are shown as a cryptogenic cause of stroke, and vascular risk factors and taking protective measures against them will be effective in preventing strokes. In our research, we aim to increase awareness on this issue by classifying the frequency of carotid webs and their radiological classification; We aimed to evaluate the clinical data and vascular risk factors of carotid web cases, determine their relationship with ischemic stroke, and determine the precautions that can be taken to contribute to future optimal treatment approaches."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Carotid Artery Diseases"],"keywords":["carotid web","ischemic stroke","transient ischemic atack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with carotid web detected","description":"Patients in whom carotid web was detected by examining carotid CTA images","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: CT angiography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"CT angiography","description":"No intervention was made","armGroupLabels":["Patients with carotid web detected"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ischemic stroke","description":"dysarthria, weakness, facial paralysis","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"transient ischemic atack","description":"temporary weakness and slurred speech","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being over 18 years old\n\n  * Having a preliminary diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease\n  * Having carotid CTA and/or DSA imaging performed\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being under 18 years of age\n* Patients who cannot undergo CTA and/or DSA imaging due to the risk of contrast material allergy or renal failure.\n* Patients for whom consent for imaging cannot be obtained by the patient and their relatives and for whom CTA/DSA examination is not required in terms of etiology","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients over 18 years of age who underwent carotid CTA and/or DSA imaging with the preliminary diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease and a carotid web was detected.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"ekin EB baylam yirmibeş","affiliation":"Suleyman Demirel University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Suleyman Demirel University","city":"Isparta","zip":"32260","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":37.76444,"lon":30.55222}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"},{"id":"D000002340","term":"Carotid Artery Diseases"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5284","name":"Carotid Artery Diseases","asFound":"Carotid Artery Diseases","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
