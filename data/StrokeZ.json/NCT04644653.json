While transcatheter endovascular therapy is widely accepted as an effective method for targeted blood vessels via a catheter to elicit ischemic necrosis.\n\nTo improve targeting accuracy administrated tPA and avoiding collateral tissue damage, we developed a magnetic nanorobotic system to active system to active intravenous delivery of tPA for targeted thrombus removal. Here human placenta will be used as an ex vivo model for human cerebral vascular system in our ex vivo thrombolysis study. Our magnetic nanorobotic system encapsulated with tPA overcomes the limitations of passive thrombolytic therapy with tPA alone and will be a promising approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke and other thrombotic diseases"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Thrombolysis performance","description":"Size of thrombus by angiography, mm","timeFrame":"1 -2 hours"},{"measure":"Time for recanalization","description":"Time for recanalization of occluded vessels, mins","timeFrame":"1 -2 hours"},{"measure":"Damage to vessels","description":"Histological damage evaluation.
