The MDBP is one of the world's largest leukodystrophy biorepositories, having enrolled nearly 2,000 affected individuals since it was launched over a decade ago.\n\nResearchers working in the biorepository hope to use these materials to uncover new genetic etiologies for various leukodystrophies, develop biomarkers for use in future clinical trials, and better understand the natural history of these disorders. The knowledge gained from these efforts may help improve the diagnostic tools and treatment options available to patients in the future.","detailedDescription":"Genetic white matter disorders (leukodystrophies) are estimated to have an incidence of approximately 1:7000 live births. In the past, patients with white matter disease of unknown cause evaluated by the investigator achieved a diagnosis in fewer than 46% of cases after extensive conventional clinical testing. Even when a diagnosis is achieved, the diagnosis takes an average of eight years and this \"odyssey\" results in testing charges to patients and insurers in excess of $8,000 on average per patient, including patients who never achieve a diagnosis at all. With next generation approaches such as whole exome sequencing, the diagnostic efficacy is closer to 70%, but approximately a third of individuals do not achieve a specific etiologic diagnosis. These diagnostic challenges represent an urgent and unresolved gap in knowledge and disease characterization, as obtaining a definitive diagnosis is of paramount importance for leukodystrophy patients.\n\nMoreover, the mechanisms of disease in many leukodystrophies of known cause are very poorly understood, with little known about the best symptomatic management and, thus, limited standards of care are available for the management of these patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to: (Aim 1) Define novel homogeneous groups of patients with unclassified leukodystrophy and work toward finding the cause of these disorders; (Aim 2) assess the validity and utility of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of leukodystrophies; (Aim 3) establish disease mechanisms in selected known leukodystrophies; (Aim 4) track current care and natural history of these patients to define the longitudinal course and determinants of outcomes in these disorders; (Aim 5) contact subjects for future research studies and/or clinical programs.\n\nThis biorepository will use available basic science and clinical research approaches to establish novel diagnoses, biomarkers, and outcome measures for future clinical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukodystrophy","White Matter Disease","Leukoencephalopathies","4H Syndrome","Adrenoleukodystrophy","AMN","ALD","ALD Gene Mutation","ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy)","X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy","X-ALD","Adrenomyeloneuropathy","Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome","AGS","Alexander Disease","Alexanders Leukodystrophy","AxD","ADLD","Canavan Disease","CTX","Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatoses","Krabbe Disease","GALC Deficiency","Globoid Leukodystrophy","TUBB4A-Related Leukodystrophy","H-ABC - Hypomyelination, Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum","HBSL","HBSL - Hypomyelination, Brain Stem, Spinal Cord, Leg Spasticity","LBSL","Leukoencephalopathy With Brain Stem and Spinal Cord Involvement and High Lactate Syndrome (Disorder)","Leukoencephalopathy With Brainstem and Spinal Cord Involvement and Lactate Elevation","ALSP","CSF1R Gene Mutation","HCC - Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract","MLC1","Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy With Subcortical Cysts","MLD","Metachromatic Leukodystrophy","PMD","Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease","PLP1 Null Syndrome","PLP1 Gene Duplication &#X7C; Blood or Tissue &#X7C; Mutations","Pelizaeus Merzbacher Like Disease","Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorder","Zellweger Syndrome","Refsum Disease","Salla Disease","Sialic Storage Disease","Sj√∂gren","Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome","Van Der Knapp Disease","Vanishing White Matter Disease","Charcot-Marie-Tooth","CMT","Mct8 (Slc16A2)-Specific Thyroid Hormone Cell Transporter Deficiency","Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome","Cadasil","Cockayne Syndrome","Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency","Gangliosidoses","GM2 Gangliosidosis","BPAN","Labrune Syndrome","LCC","Mucopolysaccharidoses","TBCK-Related Intellectual Disability Syndrome"],"keywords":["leukodystrophy","white matter disease","leukoencephalopathy","myelin","demyelinating","mdbp"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Samples may be collected from affected subjects, as well as healthy controls.
