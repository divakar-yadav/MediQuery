Purpose of the study is to learn more about the safety and how well the drugs rivaroxaban, apixaban and warfarin work in patients appropriately and inappropriately receiving standard and reduced doses of each drug for reducing the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation. Real world data from routine general practice stored in the primary care database in the UK, The Health Improvement Network (THIN), will be used for investigation.","detailedDescription":"Primary objectives are to assess the safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban, apixaban and warfarin based on the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhagic strokes (safety) and ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and myocardial infarction (effectiveness). Secondary objectives comprise the assessment of the mentioned risks in subpopulations of patients with renal impairment or diabetes, mortality rates, and drug utilisation as well as patient characteristics before and after the first intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Oral
