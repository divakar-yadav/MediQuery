Data will be abstracted from the patient chart using methodologies developed and validated in the Registry of the Ontario Stroke Network. The investigators have REB approval to collect this data and to link with administrative datasets through the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences (ICES). The investigators will use regression models to determine whether DOC screen scores add to baseline clinical and demographic data to predict the main negative outcomes. The investigators hope to identify which patients presenting to TIA/stroke prevention clinics are at highest risk of adverse long-term events so focused interventions can be developed to improve survival, outcomes and function of stroke prevention clinic patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Depression","Obstructive Sleep Apnea","Cognitive
