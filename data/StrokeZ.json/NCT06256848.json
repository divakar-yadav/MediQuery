The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n• Can Myofascial Release Therapy improve swallowing function in Stroke Survivors? Patients will be randomly allocated into the control group or the experimental group, all under rehabilitation treatment, the experimental group will be given Myofascial Release Therapy. The study lasts 21 days for each patient. Researchers will compare the Functional Oral Intake Scale, Penetration-Aspiration Scale, Swallowing Quality of Life to see if the Myofascial Release Therapy can help improve the situation.","detailedDescription":"Myofascial release, also known as fascial release or fascial manipulation, is a physical therapy used to treat muscle and fascial tissue tension or pain. It involves applying appropriate pressure and stretching to release tight fascia and soft tissues, improving blood circulation, alleviating pain, and promoting rehabilitation.\n\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to explore Clinical Effect of Myofascial Release Therapy in Dysphagic Stroke Survivors.

The Functional Oral Intake Scale assessment form includes seven levels of scoring, ranging from level 1 to level 7, indicating a progressive improvement in the patient's oral intake ability. In general, the result below level 6 indicates unsafe for oral intake while level 6 and above indicates that eating via mouth can be safely conducted.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 21"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age ≥ 18 years;\n* meeting the diagnostic criteria of stroke;\n* any degree of dysphagia at admission;\n* steady vital signs, without severe cognitive impairment or sensory aphasia, able to cooperate with the assessment.\n* transferred out within three weeks of hospitalization in the neurology department.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* complicated with other neurological diseases;\n* damaged mucosa or incomplete structure in nasopharynx;\n* tracheostomy tube plugged;\n* unfeasible to Myofascial Release;\n* simultaneously suffering from liver, kidney failure, tumors, or hematological diseases.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Zhefeng Wang, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"19501376864","email":"zhengzhouzhj@qq.com"},{"name":"Weiji Zhao, Master","role":"CONTACT","phone":"17839973473","email":"zwjww2009@163.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nieto Luis, Master","affiliation":"Site Coordinator of United Medical Group located in Miami","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Mianyang Central Hospital","city":"Mianyang","state":"Henan","zip":"450000","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":31.46784,"lon":104.68168}},{"facility":"Zhengda Yi Hospital","city":"Zhengzhou","state":"Henan","zip":"450000","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":34.75778,"lon":113.64861}},{"facility":"Guanghan People's Hospital","city":"Guanghan","state":"Sichuan","zip":"618300","country":"China"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003680","term":"Deglutition Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000004935","term":"Esophageal Diseases"},{"id":"D000005767","term":"Gastrointestinal Diseases"},{"id":"D000004066","term":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"id":"D000010608","term":"Pharyngeal Diseases"},{"id":"D000010038","term":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6572","name":"Deglutition Disorders","asFound":"Dysphagia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7775","name":"Esophageal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8573","name":"Gastrointestinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6945","name":"Digestive System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13205","name":"Pharyngeal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12651","name":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC09","name":"Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
