As a leading center for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease in the Midwest as well as being one of the first Comprehensive Stroke Centers in the United States we have a large potential patient group to assess.\n\nThe pilot plan is to compare conventional CT/CTA/CTP acquired during the clinical work up with C-arm CBCT/CTA/CTP acquired in the angiography suite at initiation of therapy. The C-arm CBCT acquisition provides whole brain coverage (compared to only 8 cm brain coverage with conventional CT) with less radiation and higher resolution; the CT perfusion maps obtained using C-arm CBCT and new reconstruction algorithms provides better perfusion maps."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single center, open label, single-arm, pilot study","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"C-ARM CBCT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A C-arm CBCT evaluation with SMART RECON novel software for the rapid assessment of time-resolved CT angiogram and CT perfusion.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: C-Arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"C-Arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography","description":"C-ARM CBCT angiogram and CBCT perfusion imaging using prototype software (SMART-RECON) can rapidly and accurately assess the cerebral blood flow maps in the setting of decreased blood flow to the brain (ischemic cerebrovascular events).
