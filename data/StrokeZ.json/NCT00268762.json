Follow up CT scanning and TCD every 30 minutes for 2 hours and then daily will determine the incidence of hemorrhage, recanalization and reocclusion, and serial neurological exam will determine the clinical outcome. For patients without temporal windows, a baseline CT-Angiogram (CTA) demonstrating arterial occlusion can also be enrolled. In those patients, a follow-up CTA (24-36 hours) will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","thrombin inhibition","thrombolysis","bleeding","outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Argatroban IV Infusion 1 mcg/kg/min for 48 hours","interventionNames":["Drug: argatroban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"argatroban","description":"Argatroban IV Infusion at 1mcg/kg/min for 48 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic and Radiographic Intracerebral Hemorrhage","description":"Significant intracerebral hemorrhage as defined by either:\n\n1.
