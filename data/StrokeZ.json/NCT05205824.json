Stroke subjects will be measured while performing tasks like walking, sitting and standing while wearing light-weight inertial measurements units (IMUs) incorporating 3D accelerometers, 3D gyroscopes and surface electromyography. During the measurements subjects will be recorded on video that serves as ground truth when validating the implemented algorithms for movement analysis. A face blurring program will be used for all video footage.","detailedDescription":"Subjects will perform the following tasks: 30 sec stationary sitting/standing/lying; 10m walk test; L-test; 8-figure walking test; daily life task; stepping over small obstacles; walk in the corridor. During the measurments IMU will be placed at: sternum; sacrum; bilateral wrists; bilateral shanks; bilateral upper legs; both feet. Surface EMG of bilateral rectus femoris; vastus lateralis; medial gastrocnemius and soleus will be measured."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Algorithm validation","type":"OTHER","description":"all subjects will be measured with inertial measurement units while performing tasks like walking, standing and sitting.","interventionNames":["Other: algorithm validation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"algorithm validation","description":"stroke subjects are measured to validate algorithms previously developed after including healthy subjects","armGroupLabels":["Algorithm validation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Inertial measurement unit data","description":"Activity data of the sensors attached to various body parts","timeFrame":"1-2 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"surface EMG-data","description":"rectus femoris/vastus lateralis/gastrocnemius/soleus data","timeFrame":"1-2 hours"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"anonymized video data","description":"Video data of the measurements performed","timeFrame":"1-2 hours"},{"measure":"Age","description":"Age (in years)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Height","description":"Height (in cm)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Leg length","description":"Leg length (in cm)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Time since stroke","description":"time since stroke (in years)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Type of stroke","description":"type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Body side","description":"Affected and dominant body side (left or right)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"FAC-score","description":"Functional Ambulation Categories score (0-5 points) to assess independence of walking","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Motricity Index","description":"Motricity index lower limb (0-33 points)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* min 18 yrs of age; history of previous stroke; unilateral affected;able to walk without supervision (FAC-score min 4);able to perform activities of daily living without assistance (self-reported); written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* subjects with neurological or motor disorders that could interfere with the measurements (other than stroke) or severe deficits in communication, memory and understanding.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"C Nikamp, PhD","affiliation":"Roessingh Research and Development","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Roessingh Research and Development","city":"Enschede","zip":"7522AH","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.21833,"lon":6.89583}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"not decided within the consortium yet"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
