It is estimated that less than 50% of stroke survivors will recover arm function, which will exert a great economic, social and personal toll.\n\nNeuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is one of the techniques suggested for upper limb recovery in stroke patients. However, after considering the bibliographic background, more studies are required in order to test its effectiveness, to establish the most efficient NMES protocols and to assess the characteristics of the patients who can benefit the most from this treatment. With this regard, the parameters of the stimulation are currently subject to debate, and more data are needed to optimize the application of this treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two neuromuscular electrical stimulation protocols with different stimulation frequencies on motor impairment, kinaesthetic sensation, functional motor ability, activities of daily living, and quality of life in older adults with spastic hemiparesis suffering a stroke.\n\nTo cope with the objective of the present study, RCT was conducted. Subjects who met inclusion criteria were recruited from a hospital rehabilitation unit. After the screening and signed consent, participants were randomly allocated to the control group or one of both experimental groups. NMES was applied on wrist and finger extensors for 30 minutes, 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. The electrostimulation protocols were only differentiated in the parameter of the stimulation frequency, 35 Hz or 50 Hz, depending on the experimental group to which the patient belonged to. Outcome measures were collected at the beginning, after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and after a follow-up period (4 weeks)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Electric stimulation","Upper limb","Aging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":69,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"50 Hz NMES group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was applied on wrist and finger extensors for 30 minutes, 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks.

The RNSA includes three subscales: tactile sensation, kinesthetic sensation, and stereognosis. For kinesthetic sensation, all three aspects of the movement were tested: appreciation of movement, its direction, and accurate joint position sense. The limb on the affected side of the body was supported and moved by the examiner in various directions but the movement is only at one joint at a time. The patients were asked to mirror the change of movement with the other limb. This subscale ranges from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate better kinaesthetic sensation.","timeFrame":"The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention."},{"measure":"Change in activities of daily living","description":"A score of the Barthel Index ranging from 0 to 100 was collected where 0 is the minimum (worst outcome) and 100 is the maximum (best outcome).","timeFrame":"The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention."},{"measure":"Change in health-related quality of life","description":"COOP/WONCA charts were used.
