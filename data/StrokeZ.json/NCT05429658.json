The consent process has been completed with the subject, Legally Authorized Representative, or two physician best interest and consent is documented\n2. Age \\>18 years\n3. Clinical signs consistent with an acute ischemic stroke\n4. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score \\>= 6\n5. Pre-stroke modified Rankin Score (mRS) \\<= 2\n6. Acute occlusion of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), vertebral or basilar arteries confirmed via computed tomography angiography (CTA) and/or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)\n7.

Known pregnancy or breast feeding\n2. Known comorbidity that may complicate treatment or prevent improvement or follow-up\n3. Known life expectancy \\< 12 months\n4. Known history of severe allergy to contrast medium\n5. Subject known to have suffered a stroke in the past 90 days\n6. Subject participating in another study involving an investigational device or drug.\n7. Known connective tissue disorder affecting the arteries (e.g. Marfan syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)\n8. Any known pre-existing hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency\n9.
