The hypotheses are that the treatments are not only extremely safe, but also statistically beneficial for all conditions. Outcomes will be determined by numerous valid outcome instruments that compile general quality of life information along with condition-specific information as well.","detailedDescription":"The study will be ongoing for patient inclusion and data acquisition. Patients who have Orthopedic, Neurologic, Urologic, Autoimmune, Renal, Cardiac and Pulmonary Conditions will be included.\n\nThe study has been approved by an Alion accredited Institutional Review Board, Solutions IRB, as of March 2019.\n\nDepending on the condition, patients may receive a series of therapies via one or more of the following methods: intravenous, injection, intra-nasal and/or nebulizer. R3 has several \"best practice\" therapy protocols that participating practices will follow. Should a patient have conditions that fall into more than one condition category, he or she can still be included with the protocols being received for each condition(s).\n\nHere is a specific administration for each condition category:\n\n1. Orthopedic Condition = Injection\n2. Neurologic Disease = IV Infusion and Intranasal Procedure. The exception is with Peripheral Neuropathy, where participants receive a series of injections along with an IV Infusion Procedure.\n3. Urologic = Injection\n4. Autoimmune = IV Infusion\n5. Cardiac = IV Infusion\n6. Pulmonary = IV Infusion plus Nebulizer\n7. Renal = IV Infusion\n\nPre, Intra and Post procedure data acquisition will occur at various time frames up to 10 years. Follow up time-frames will measure changes occurring from baseline post procedure at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months and then on average each year, up to 10 years. Patients will pay for procedures, and no randomization will occur."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Orthopedic Disorder","Neurologic Disorder","Urologic Diseases","Erectile Dysfunction","Autoimmune Diseases","Renal Failure","Renal Insufficiency","Kidney Diseases","Cardiac Event","Cardiomyopathies","CHF","Pulmonary Disease","COPD","Alzheimer Disease","Stroke","Neuropathy;Peripheral","Arthritis"],"keywords":["stem cell therapy","umbilical stem cells","amniotic stem cells","stem cells","regenerative medicine","r3 stem cell","perinatal tissue","placenta stem cell"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study will be ongoing for patient inclusion and data acquisition.
