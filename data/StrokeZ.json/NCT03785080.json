These patients are at increased risk for devastating future thromboembolic events including stroke if NOAC is not resumed promptly, whilst premature resumption of anticoagulants can result in recurrent GIB, haemorrhage, anaemia, myocardial ischaemia and infarction in those with ischaemic heart disease, and even death. However, the question as to how early a NOAC can be safely restarted after acute GIB has not been previously answered, and there remains an important knowledge gap.","detailedDescription":"The effectiveness and relative safety of NOACs have been demonstrated in large international studies where reductions in the incidence of stroke in patients with AF have been reported. However, the benefits of an anticoagulant are offset by increased incident rates of bleeding including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, less commonly, intracranial bleeding, warranting careful anticoagulation management during periods when patients are susceptible to the risks for bleeding, stroke and thromboembolism.\n\nThe exact duration for withholding NOAC after acute GIB is unknown and in general, current clinical society guidelines and statements are non-specific and relatively open-ended regarding the optimal timing to restart non-warfarin oral anticoagulant (NOAC) after gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who require the prophylactic medication for stroke prevention. These patients are at increased risk for devastating future thromboembolic events including stroke if NOAC is not resumed, whilst premature resumption of anticoagulants can result in recurrent GIB, haemorrhage, anaemia, myocardial ischaemia and infarction in those with ischaemic heart disease, and even death.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if restarting NOAC very early after endoscopic haemostasis of bleeding peptic ulcer lesions is equivalent to early resumption in AF patients in terms of safety and efficacy for prevention of recurrent bleeding freedom from GIB recurrence, while maintaining undiminished benefits in reducing incident rates of systemic thromboembolism."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding"],"keywords":["gastrointestinal bleeding","stroke","thromboembolism","atrial fibrillation","NOAC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":552,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"restart NOAC very early","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"restart NOAC within 24 hours","interventionNames":["Other: restart NOAC very early"]},{"label":"restart NOAC early","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"restart NOAC at 72 - 84 hours","interventionNames":["Other: restart NOAC early"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"restart NOAC very early","description":"withhold NOAC less than 24 hours Post OGD","armGroupLabels":["restart NOAC very early"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"restart NOAC early","description":"withhold NOAC for 72 to 84 hours Post OGD","armGroupLabels":["restart NOAC early"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding","description":"melaena and/or haematemesis with drop in Hb \\>2g/dL and confirmation of bleeding by endoscopy.","timeFrame":"30 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding","description":"melaena and/or haematemesis with drop in Hb \\>2g/dL and confirmation of bleeding by endoscopy.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Ischemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack","description":"an acute episode of neurologic deficit of presumed vascular or cardioembolic origin;
