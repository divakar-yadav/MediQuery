At the same time, all admissions to the hospital is also recorded with diagnosis in a separate database. We intend to make a nation-wide complete follow up of all TAVR/TAVI patients in swede that has received the diagnosis of stroke after the implantation. In addition data will also be collected from the national stroke database for detailed information of the cases"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["TAVR","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4600,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient suffering a late stroke after TAVR","description":"All patients suffering a stroke after TAVR will be studied","interventionNames":["Device: TAVR"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"TAVR","description":"Patient recieving a TAVR","armGroupLabels":["Patient suffering a late stroke after TAVR"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke","description":"Stroke as defined by the national stroke database","timeFrame":"5 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAll patients that has under TAVR/TAVI in Sweden between 2008 and 2018 Exclusion Criteria: Patients unable to follow up due to emigration or missing social security number\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPeriprocedural stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All pateints recieving a TAVR device in Sweden during study period","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Skane University Hospital","city":"Lund","zip":"22185","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":55.70584,"lon":13.19321}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14","submissionTracking":{"estimatedResultsFirstSubmitDate":"2022-10-25","submissionInfos":[{"releaseDate":"2022-10-25","resetDate":"2022-11-17","mcpReleaseN":3},{"releaseDate":"2023-11-16","resetDate":"2023-12-04","mcpReleaseN":4}]}},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000082862","term":"Aortic Valve Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000006349","term":"Heart Valve Diseases"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2380","name":"Aortic Valve Disease","asFound":"Aortic Valve Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9127","name":"Heart Valve Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
