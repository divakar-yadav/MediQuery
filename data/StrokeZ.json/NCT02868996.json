Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age (inclusive);\n2. Healthy with no clinically significant medical problems;\n3. BMI between 18 to 30 kg/m2 with a weight between 50 to 100 kg (both inclusive);\n4. No history of alcohol or drug abuse (Paracetamol, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Methadone, Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, Opiates, Phencyclidine, Tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabis), Tricyclic Antidepressants). Subjects should be enrolled only after passing the urine drug screen (positive test for paracetamol will be allowed);\n5. Non-smokers or light smokers (Less than 5 cigarettes per day) by history and planned during the study;\n6. No history of significant allergic diathesis such as urticaria, angioedema or anaphylaxis;\n7. Receiving no chronic medications that affect blood pressure control, the bradykinin or angiotensin system including angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB);\n8. Willing and able to sign written, informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any significant past or current cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal or other medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make participation of the subject in this study medically unsafe or compromise the accuracy of assessment of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of the study;\n2. Subjects who have abnormal safety labs outside the local lab ranges will be excluded at PI's discretion based on his/her assessment of clinical significance (can be repeated once at screening at PI's discretion);\n3. Subjects with past medical history of malignancy except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin who have had curative surgical treatment and at least 6 months have elapsed since the procedure;\n4. A value outside the specified range of 90 mm Hg - 140 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 50 mm Hg - 90 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (both inclusive) at screening (can be repeated once at screening as per PI's discretion);\n5. Subjects using angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) to control blood pressure;\n6. History of clinically significant acute bacterial, viral, or fungal systemic infections in the last 4 weeks prior to screening;\n7. Clinical or laboratory evidence of an active infection at the time of screening;\n8. Known alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (Î±1-antitrypsin deficiency);\n9. Serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or anti-hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV) at screening;\n10. Vaccination within 3 months of screening for the study or requiring vaccination during the study or within 3 months after completion of the study;\n11. Females who are pregnant or nursing;\n12. Females of childbearing potential (i.e., any woman who is not surgically sterile e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or \\>1-year postmenopause status confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels as defined by established lab ranges) and all men who, if participating in heterosexual sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy are unable or unwilling to practice medically effective contraception during the study. They should agree to use two reliable methods of contraception (e.g., double-barrier condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus a stable dose of hormonal contraception) throughout the study period and until 3 months after receiving study drug. Women of childbearing potential will require compulsory pregnancy testing. A negative pregnancy test (serum and urine) will be documented during screening and at Day -1 respectively;\n13. Participation in any other drug study within 8 weeks or 5 half-lives of the study drug, whichever is longer;\n14. Unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol requirements for study visits and procedures;\n15.
