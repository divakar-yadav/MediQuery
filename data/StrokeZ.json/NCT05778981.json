After non-cardiac surgery, cardiovascular events correlate with surgical outcomes. Understanding the role of endothelial function in these events is crucial.\n\nThis research aims to study endothelial function and its association with cardiovascular events.","detailedDescription":"To study the presence of endothelial damage and its association with cardiac events, the investigators will perform an observational study to evaluate flow-induced dilatation of the brachial artery in patients scheduled for non-cardiac surgery.\n\nAfter ethical review board approval, the investigators will select 200 patients admitted for non-cardiac surgery. After the patient written consent, the investigators will perform an ultrasound evaluation of the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. This will be performed before, during, and after surgery. A basal troponin level will be obtained and repeatedly measured in the three days after surgery.\n\nThe investigators will observe clinical outcomes one, 3, and 6 months after the hospitalization.\n\nTo observe 8% of events, for a 5% alpha and 80% power, 161 patients are needed for our study. The authors considered that to account for a loss of 10% of patients, a sample of 177 patients will be required. Considering no national or local incidence of cardiovascular events, we aim to complete a 200-patient selection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Surgery","Cardiac Death","Stroke","Myocardial Injury"],"keywords":["FMD","Flow-Mediated Dilatation","Troponin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"FMD - Troponin measurement","description":"Echographic FMD evaluation.
