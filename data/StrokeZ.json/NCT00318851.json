Approximately 75% of strokes occur in the distribution of the carotid arteries. Among those, a thrombotic etiology (carotid occlusive disease) is one of the most common causes. Recently published studies have shown that patients who underwent carotid stenting in combination with a cerebral protection device had better overall outcomes as related to stroke, death and MI as opposed to carotid endarterectomy. What is not known is whether protection devices which allow some particles (100 micron particle size or less) to pass through the filter or particles that embolize during placement or removal of the protection device, will have any delayed abnormal outcomes as determined by neuropsychological testing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Stenosis"],"keywords":["Carotid Artery stenting","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carotid Artery Stenting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Carotid Stent with Distal Protection Device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Carotid Stent with Distal Protection Device","description":"Carotid Stent Placement with Distal Protection","armGroupLabels":["Carotid Artery Stenting"],"otherNames":["Carotid Artery Stenting","Neurocognitive evaluation in Carotid Artery Stenting"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of new diffusion weighted abnormalities post-procedure","timeFrame":"24 hours post stent placement"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neuropsychological stability or deterioration","timeFrame":"3 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Neuropsychological stability or deterioration","timeFrame":"6 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Neuropsychological stability or deterioration","timeFrame":"12 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Acute versus delayed neuropsychological changes","timeFrame":"1-7 days post procedure"},{"measure":"Acute versus delayed neuropsychological changes","timeFrame":"3 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Acute versus delayed neuropsychological changes","timeFrame":"6 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Acute versus delayed neuropsychological changes","timeFrame":"12 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Stroke and death","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Stroke and death","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Stroke and death","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"NIH stroke scale changes","timeFrame":"24 hours post procedure"},{"measure":"NIH stroke scale changes","timeFrame":"1 month post procedure"},{"measure":"NIH stroke scale changes","timeFrame":"6 months post procedure"},{"measure":"NIH stroke scale changes","timeFrame":"12 months post procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age greater than 18 and less than 90\n* Symptomatic as evidenced by transient ischemic attack or non-disabling stroke in the hemisphere supplied by the target vessel within 180 days of procedure.
