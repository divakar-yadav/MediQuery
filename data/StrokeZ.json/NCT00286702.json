A contracture is often treated by therapists who use hand splinting to prevent it occurring or slow down its progression. Despite their wide use, there has not been research completed to investigate whether or not splinting prevents contracture in people following stroke. In fact, this project will be the first of its kind in the world and is therefore vital to stroke rehabilitation.\n\nThe study is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial that will measure the effect of hand-splinting in two positions on the prevention of contracture, functional use of the hand, and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["splints","Occupational Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"enrollmentInfo":{"count":63}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"hand splint"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* first ever stroke\n* score of \\<1 on Motor Assessment Scale item 6\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* comorbidity resulting in previous contracture of the wrist/hand","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Natasha Lannin, BSc(OT)","affiliation":"University of Western Sydney","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Anne Cusick, PhD","affiliation":"University of Western Sydney","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6200","name":"Contracture","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
