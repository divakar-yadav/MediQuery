At pharmacologic concentrations however, pro-urokinase is converted to urokinase - a non specific thrombolytic, limiting its therapeutic use. Mutant pro-urokinase (M5) is more stable and its conversion to urokinase is inhibited by C1-inhibitor.\n\nThe primary objectives of the study are:\n\n* To assess the overall safety and tolerability related to systemic plasminogen activation of single doses of M5 over a wide dose range (study part I).\n* To assess the effect of single doses of C1-inhibitor on the overall safety and tolerability of single doses of M5 and its effect on M5-induced coagulation changes (study part II).","detailedDescription":"Mutant proUK, M5, was specifically designed to improve the plasma stability of single-chain proUK by reducing its intrinsic catalytic activity and allowing it to retain its proenzyme form until it encounters a thrombus. As an additional consequence of the mutation, its two-chain enzymatic form (tcM5) is sensitive to inhibition by C1-inhibitor (C1INH) a relatively abundant plasma inhibitor.\n\nWhile it has a negligible effect on urokinase (UK), C1INH inhibits tcM5 irreversibly, preventing non-specific plasminogen activation, responsible for bleeding complications. The effect of endogenous C1INH can be augmented by the addition of exogenous C1INH. In vitro studies in rats and dogs indicated that adding C1INH to plasma prior to clot lysis by M5 prevented bleeding, fibrinogenolysis and plasminogen depletion but did not affect the rate of fibrinolysis. In a recent pilot rat stroke study, at similarly effective doses, M5, preceded by C1INH adjunctive therapy, was equivalent to tPA alone but caused significantly less ICH, was much more effective than tPA preceded by adjunctive C1INH, and was the only group with a significant functional improvement at 24h.\n\nDose restrictions which limit efficacy of tPA-based thrombolysis are expected to be circumvented by M5 preceded by adjunctive C1INH. C1INH is a commercially available plasma derived product with a well-established safety and efficacy profile and is currently indicated and available for routine prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema (HAE)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","TS01","Mutant pro-urokinase","M5","C1 inhibitor","Safety","Stroke","Tolerability","Ischemia","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Fibrinolytic Agents","Thrombolytic Agents","Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action","Pharmacologic Actions","Cardiovascular Agents","Therapeutic Uses","Hematologic Agents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The trial consists of two study parts in which healthy male volunteers will randomly and in a double-blinded manner receive a single dose of M5 or M5-placebo intravenously, with (part II) or without (part I) a preceding single dose of C1-inhibitor.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double-blinded study.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mutant pro-urokinase (M5) alone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the first study part subjects in cohorts of 4 will receive ascending doses of either M5 (3 subjects) or M5-placebo (1 subject) without C1-inhibitor.","interventionNames":["Drug: M5"]},{"label":"Mutant pro-urokinase (M5) and its inhibitor, C1 inhibitor","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the second study part subjects in cohorts of 5 will receive ascending doses of either M5 or M5-placebo, preceded by a single intravenous dose of C1-inhibitor or C1-inhibitor-placebo.
