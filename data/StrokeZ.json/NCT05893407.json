More precisely, it aims :\n\n* to evaluate the heterogeneity of brain perfusion and thus diagnose brain tissue hypoperfusion with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.\n* to correlate contrast-enhanced ultrasound with perfusion measurements by usual multimodal monitoring.","detailedDescription":"The main aim is to evaluate the heterogeneity of brain perfusion, thus diagnosing brain tissue hypoperfusion with PerCEUS, then to correlate it with the usual multimodal monitoring.\n\nEarlier after hospitalization in neurointensive care, when the study physician needs to realize a contrast ultrasound imaging and without delaying any emergency procedure, a PerCEUS will be performed in patients with an acute brain injury. After acquisition, data from PerCEUS will be transferred to an external evaluation unit and analysed offline, using commercially available software Qlab (Philips ®). According to the localization of acute brain injuries with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT), several regions-of-interest (ROI, at least three in each area) will be chosen :\n\n* Area 1 : in the core of the lesion (supposed non perfused)\n* Area 2 : just next to the lesion (supposed hypoperfused)\n* Area 3 : in the saner hemisphere, symmetrically to area 2 each time it's possible (supposed well-perfused).\n\nEvery parameters of multimodal monitoring used at the moment of PerCEUS will be relieved :\n\n* intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP)\n* mean flow velocity (MFV) by transcranial doppler (TCD)\n* regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) by Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)\n* jugular venous oximetry (SjvO2).\n\nThe actual PerCEUS measurement takes place at the bedside, is performed by the study physician, and takes about 5 minutes.\n\nThe trial duration per patient is 30 minutes, ending after 25 minutes of oversight"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Hemorrhage","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Ischemic Stroke","Cerebrovascular Circulation","Perfusion"],"keywords":["Brain perfusion","Cerebral blood flow","Diagnostic imaging","Ultrasonography Doppler","Doppler ultrasound","Transcranial Doppler","Contrast enhanced ultrasound","Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography","Contrast ultrasound","Ultrasound perfusion imaging","Ultrasound contrast agent","Intra-cranial pressure","Intracerebral hematoma","Neurocritical care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with acute brain injuries when a contrast ultrasound imaging is requested by the physician","description":"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging (PerCEUS)","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Measuring contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion with phase inversion harmonic imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Measuring contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion with phase inversion harmonic imaging","description":"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging (PerCEUS) will be performed by a dedicated study team.

The imaging plane will be then tilted to the diencephalic, in which the frontal horns of the side ventricles and the third ventricle serve as landmarks and where the anterior and posterior middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and the basal ganglia (BG) as region of interest could be identified without artefacts from major vessels.
