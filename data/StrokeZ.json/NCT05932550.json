Current treatment options are limited and there is an unmet need for specific and effective therapeutic options.\n\nObjective: To examine the safety and efficacy of Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, as a possible add-on treatment option for PSD, in an open-labeled proof-of-concept clinical trial.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: A 10-week trial of daily oral 300 mg Maraviroc in ten patients with subcortical stroke suffering from PSD. Follow-up: eight weeks after completing treatment.\n\nMain Outcome Measure: A change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Maraviroc 300 mg/day","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Open-label study","interventionNames":["Drug: Maraviroc 300 mg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Maraviroc 300 mg","description":"10 week treatment as add-on therapy to anti-depressants","armGroupLabels":["Maraviroc 300 mg/day"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)","description":"depression score","timeFrame":"10 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"16-item quick inventory of depressive symptoms- self-report, QIDS-SR16","description":"self-report depression score","timeFrame":"10 weeks"},{"measure":"clinical global impression scale (CGI)","description":"Clinician impression","timeFrame":"10 weeks"},{"measure":"7-item patient-reported generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale- GAD-7","description":"Anxiety score","timeFrame":"10 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 1.
