Aims will evaluate the effects of short-term changes on each of the semantic or phonological language process of interest in isolation and changes in the interaction between language sub-processes and their interaction with other cognitive domains that directly or indirectly affect language functions. The brain targets for TMS application will be informed by existing evidence on (correlational but not causal) associations between language regions and specific language processes from numerous prior neuroimaging (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI) and neuropsychological studies. Healthy individuals and/or stroke survivors with aphasia will be recruited to address these aims."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia","Language"],"keywords":["TMS","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Aphasia","Semantic processing","Phonological processing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Multiple studies will be conducted in parallel.
