In addition, rhPro-UK does not form covalent complexes with protease inhibitors in plasma, so the concentrations of rhpro-UK and protease inhibitors in the blood do not decrease compared with alteplase. Therefore, rhPro-UK therapies have a potential advantage of less systemic bleeding in treated subjects. Data from several previous studies suggest that rhPro-UK is efficacious when used to treat patients with acute myocardial infarction. On April 2, 2011, rhPro-UK injection was approved by the National Medical Products Administration to treat acute myocardial infarction. Since then, rhPro-UK has been widely used to treat myocardial infarction in China.\n\nSince 2016, a phase 2 clinical trial was carried to explore the dosing of rhPro-UK in patients with acute ischemic stroke, followed by another study with a sample size of 680 patients to initially validate the efficacy and safety of the proposed dose of 35mg. The results of these studies suggested that rhPro-UK was effective, and there were no safety concerns. To further prove the efficacy and safety of rhPro-UK in patients with acute ischemic stroke, investigators conducted this phase 3 study (PROST-2)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1552,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rhPro-UK","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Recombinant Human Pro-urokinase (rhPro-UK)","interventionNames":["Drug: rhPro-UK"]},{"label":"rt-PA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Alteplase(rt-PA)","interventionNames":["Drug: rt-PA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"rhPro-UK","description":"35 mg, administered intravenously with a bolus of 15 mg within 3 minutes and the remainder by continuous infusion within 30 minutes","armGroupLabels":["rhPro-UK"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"rt-PA","description":"0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), with 10% administered intravenously as a bolus, followed by 90% infusion within 1 hour","armGroupLabels":["rt-PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome at 90 days","description":"A score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale(which ranges from 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) at 90 days indicated an excellent functional outcome.","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of patients with independent functional outcome at 90 days","description":"A score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin scale(which ranges from 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) at 90 days indicated an independent functional outcome.","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"Functional handicap","description":"The distribution of the modified Rankin scale(which ranges from 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) at 90 days","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"The proportion of patients with neurological improvement at 24 hours","description":"A reduction in NIHSS score of ≥4 or a score of 0-1 indicated neurological improvement.
