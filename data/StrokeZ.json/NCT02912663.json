This trial represents the first time that magnesium sulfate will be evaluated in human subjects as a superselectively administered neuroprotective agent administered in an acute time frame as an adjunct to intra-arterial thrombectomy. Furthermore, it will represent the first trial to evaluate combinational therapy for acute stroke neuroprotection.","detailedDescription":"Participants will be recruited from patients evaluated at University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital for acute ischemic stroke. Participants with impaired capacity may be included, as the pathology to be studied (stroke) may impair their capacity. Initial contact will be made by the sub-investigators approved to obtain consent; all sub-investigators are practitioners who would make contact with potential participants in a clinical manner under standard clinical procedures. All sub-investigators will have access to stroke patients' medical information under normal circumstances. No special outreach is necessary to recruit particular populations. Enrollment goal will be 15 patients in each group.\n\nParticipants will not be compensated or provided any incentives for study participation.\n\nThe following describes all study procedures and evaluations that are to be done as part of the study.\n\nVisit 1-Baseline (Day 0):\n\n* Obtain consent.\n* Medical history taken from medical record, participant and family to determine eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria (Standard of Care)\n* Medication history (Standard of Care)\n* Physical examination to include vital signs (Standard of Care)\n* Pregnancy Testing (Standard of Care)\n* NIH Stroke Scale (Standard of Care)\n* Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria\n* Randomization\n* Cerebral angiogram with Endovascular Thrombectomy (Standard of Care)\n* Study Drug administration\n* Adverse event (AE) collection\n\nImmediately following the thrombectomy and study procedure all participants will be transferred to the Neuro-Intenstive care Unit (ICU) or other similar ICU for at least 24 hours for monitoring and care. Vital signs and neurological assessments will be assessed every hour. Evaluations of the groin access site will be performed every every 15 minutes for the first hour, then 30 minutes for the second hour, and finally every hour for the next 4 hours. Thereafter, groin site will be will performed at every shift.\n\nVisit 2 - Within 48 hours of admission\n\nâ€¢ Non-contrast Postoperative MRI or CT (Standard of Care) The choice of one or the other will be determined by clinical criteria; CT or MRI may be preferable for different reasons depending upon the patient's clinical scenario.\n\nVisit 3 - ( By Discharge)\n\n* NIH Stroke Scale (Standard of Care)\n* Discharge Destination (Standard of Care)\n* Cognitive Assessment (Standard of Care)\n* Radiographic assessment of primary and secondary radiologic endpoints\n\nVisit 4 - End of Study (90 Days) (+/- 30 days)\n\n* UBACC assessment will be used to assess consent capacity at follow-up.\n* Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)\n* Modified Rankin Score (mRS; Standard of Care)\n\nThe visit may be conducted over the phone with the participant or their legally authorized representative.\n\nUnscheduled Visits. It is unexpected that Unscheduled Visits will be common, especially with the follow-up within 90 days after the procedure. However, subjects readmitted to the hospital for any reason will be tracked to determine if an AE occurred.\n\nProhibited Medications, Treatments and Procedures: Participants on therapeutic anticoagulation will be excluded from the study. If medically necessary for underlying conditions, therapeutic anticoagulation may be started 72 hours the study drug administration.\n\nParticipants should not use disopyramide within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil and intravenous beta-block.\n\nFollowing successful completion of the baseline visit, participants will be randomized into the study. The randomization number will be assigned by the PI/neurointerventionalist.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to receive 10mg of verapamil in 10 cc of normal saline and 1000mg of magnesium sulfate in 20cc of normal saline or matching placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Verapamil and Magnesium Sulfate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10mg of verapamil in 10 cc of normal saline and 1000mg of magnesium sulfate in 20cc of normal saline will be administered over 20 minutes (1cc/minute) through the microcatheter and into the vessel previously obstructed by clot to the treatment group","interventionNames":["Drug: Verapamil and Magnesium Sulfate"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group will receive saline only","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Verapamil and Magnesium Sulfate","description":"Single dose strategy will be used","armGroupLabels":["Verapamil and Magnesium Sulfate"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Single matching dosing strategy will be used","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["0.9% sodium chloride"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants having no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Defined as a hemorrhage occurring within 48 hours after study inclusion, temporally related to the intervention, and occurring with worsening neurological status as documented in the clinical exam.","timeFrame":"within 48 hours after treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants who had no systemic side effects from verapamil and magnesium sulfate","description":"At any point during study treatment","timeFrame":"within 90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed and dated informed consent and HIPAA form.
