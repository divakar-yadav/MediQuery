Observational follow-up of participants is currently ongoing. The current study is being conducted among participants in VITAL who experience a stroke event during follow-up and will examine whether vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation impact post-stroke outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide and is expected to become an even more prevalent cause of disability in the future as the population ages. Understanding risk factors which may prospectively influence stroke outcomes may help to reduce the morbidity burden of stroke.\n\nThe VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) examined the impact of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid \\[EPA\\] + docosahexaenoic acid \\[DHA\\]) on stroke incidence. However, the parent trial did not examine the impact of these supplements on stroke outcomes. Even if they do not significantly reduce stroke incidence, these supplements may still reduce stroke severity and improve outcomes post-stroke. Given the high morbidity burden of stroke, the impact of these supplements on stroke outcomes is of substantial scientific and public health importance.\n\nThe first aim of this study is to test whether vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the risk of poor functional outcomes as measured at hospital discharge and 6- and 12-months post-stroke. The second aim is to determine whether chronic cerebrovascular changes (white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral microbleeds) mediate the effect of vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on stroke outcomes.\n\nIndividuals enrolled in VITAL who experience a non-fatal stroke event will be mailed additional questionnaires assessing functional limitations, physical disability, and social disability. Responses from these questionnaires will be used to determine the effect of vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on post-stroke outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Vitamin D"],"keywords":["stroke","stroke outcomes","vitamin D","omega-3 fatty acid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":290,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vitamin D + fish oil","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Vitamin D","Drug: Fish oil"]},{"label":"Vitamin D + fish oil placebo","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Vitamin D","Drug: Fish oil placebo"]},{"label":"Vitamin D placebo + fish oil","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Fish oil","Dietary Supplement: Vitamin D placebo"]},{"label":"Vitamin D placebo + fish oil placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Vitamin D placebo","Drug: Fish oil placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Vitamin D","description":"Dietary Supplement: Vitamin D-3 (cholecalciferol), 2000 IU Other Name: cholecalciferol","armGroupLabels":["Vitamin D + fish oil","Vitamin D + fish oil placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fish oil","description":"Drug: Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) Omacor, 1 capsule per day.
