A database will be established including age, gender, smoking history, blood pressure, blood glucose, previous history (such as coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, stroke history, etc.), history of antiplatelet drugs, onset to treatment time, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score before treatment.\n\nIndications for endovascular therapy refer to the current guidelines. All patients will receive endovascular therapy, including direct endovascular therapy or intravenous thrombolysis with endovascular therapy. The effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke will be analyzed.\n\nThis study will enroll up at least 1,000 patients in 70 centers in China.
