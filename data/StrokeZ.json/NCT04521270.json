All over the world, stroke prevalence varies between 1.9% and 4.3%among adults older than 20 years. The incidence of a stroke increases rapidly with age, double every decade after 55 years old. After a stroke, survivors may experience several issues (i.e. rehabilitation) that increase their direct costs. Stroke survivors and their families may face considerable stroke-related financial burden. To evaluate the total amount or costs use for formal and informal care and the equipment or materials needed for care. This study will be conducted to evaluate the Financial Burden associated with stroke Survivors rehabilitation during their first post stroke year and to analyze the basic predictors of these financial expenses. Data will be collected from Sheikh Zayed hospital Lahore. A cross sectional Longitudinal study will be conducted. The Study will be conducted within 6 months of time period. Post stroke patients who discharge from hospital, after this disease had directly impacts on the survivors' and their family's lives and requires a long rehabilitation process, so they faces many challenges which will be studied. The Barthel Index Scale and Modified Charlson Co-morbidity Index is used to examine the participants autonomy in everyday life activities and their co-morbidities were administered in Stroke Survivors. Stroke Survivors who willing to participate will join in this study and the signed informed consent form will be taken from all participants. After getting approval from research committee data will be collected from the participants and SPSS V 25 will be used for data entry and analysis. The results of this study will help to explore the total amount of cost which use in stroke survivors rehabilitation process.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a clinical syndrome characterized by the rapid onset of focal neurological signs, lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with a presumed vascular cause. The main causes of stroke is it occur due to infarction and due to hemorrhage. In the U.S, approximately 40 percent of people who die from stroke are male, with 60 percent of deaths occurring in females. Worldwide, cerebro-vascular accidents (stroke) are the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability. Stroke, the sudden death of some brain cells due to lack of oxygen when the blood flow to the brain is lost by blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain, is also a leading cause of dementia and depression. Globally, 70% of strokes and 87% of both stroke-related deaths and disability-adjusted life years occur in low- and middle-income countries. Over the last four decades, the stroke incidence in low- and middle-income countries has more than doubled. During these decades stroke incidence has declined by 42% in high-income countries.\n\nThe incidence of a stroke increases rapidly with age, doubling every decade after 55 years old. There are various risk factors for stroke, including both modifiable (e.g., diet, co-morbid conditions) and non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., age, race).Other risk factors which is short-term risks or triggers (e.g., infectious events, sepsis, stress), intermediate- term risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and long-term risk factors for stroke (e.g., sex, race). Risk factors for stroke in the young also likely differ from those in older patients. Recovery and rehabilitation is the most important aspects of stroke treatment. In most strokes cases the patient recover quickly, and sometimes patient recovery is variable. Rehabilitation process includes physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. Physical therapy involves using exercise and other physical means (e.g., massage, heat) and may help patients to regain their ROM and use of their arms and legs and prevent muscle stiffness in patients or with permanent paralysis. Speech therapy may help patients regain the ability to speak. Occupational therapy may help patients regain independent function and re-learn basic skills (e.g., Getting dressed, preparing a meal and bathing). Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling global health-care problem, and rehabilitation is a major part of patient care.Potentially beneficial treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced movement therapy and robotics. Most favorable interventions that could be beneficial to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and repetitive-task training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Financial Burden","Stroke","Longitudinal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Structured Questionnaire","description":"A questionnaire that consisted of three sections:\n\n1. the patient's sociodemographic data (i.e. age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, education level and income level), and the caregiver's job, education level and income level;\n2. stroke characteristics, including type of stroke (i.e. ischaemic or haemorrhagic), severity of stroke (measured using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale \\[NIHSS\\]), length of hospital stay and stroke risk factors\n3. stroke-related costs incurred by the patients.
