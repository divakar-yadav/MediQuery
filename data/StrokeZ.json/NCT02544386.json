Rare studies have shown the relationship between some micro-architectural parameters and severity of neurological deficit. There is no study in humans on the evolution of the parameters of the microarchitecture assessed by 3D micro-tomography in the early phase of the installation of neurological deficits after stroke, in terms of a bearing bone, tibia, that a non-load bearing bones, radius.","detailedDescription":"Each patient must answer several questionnaires about their calcium intake and its ability to perform everyday tasks. They will also have 3 blood samples (15 ml each time), 3 measure of bone by 3D micro-tomography and 2 MRI examination. These examinations and sampling will take place after 30 days after stroke onset (except for MRI) and again after three months and six months after the stroke (the same day as the medical follow-up visit)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["bone microarchitecture","hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"blood sample"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients","description":"Patients who have experienced a vascular hemiplegia and accept bone measure by MRI and 3D CT scan","interventionNames":["Procedure: MRI and 3D CT scan"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"MRI and 3D CT scan","description":"Measurement of bone microarchitecture at the legs and wrists by 3D CT Scan and measuring the proportion of fat in the imaging leg bone (MRI)","armGroupLabels":["Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bone volume / tissue volume","description":"Measure of Bone volume / tissue volume by the 3D CT scan","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bone volume / tissue volume","description":"Measure of Bone volume / tissue volume by the 3D CT scan","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"intraosseous fat","description":"Measure the percentage of the intraosseous fat by MRI","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria\n\n* at least 30 years\n* vascular hemiplegia\n* National Institute of Health Stroke Score equal 4 or greater with a motor of upper limb score greater than or equal 2 and a motor score of greater than or equal legs 2\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* Concomitant bone disease\n* Endocrinopathies\n* Phasic disorders understanding\n* Contra-indication to MRI","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient aged at least 30 who have experienced a vascular hemiplegia within 30 days before enrollment","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thierry THOMAS, MD-PhD","affiliation":"CHU SAINT-ETIENNE","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000006429","term":"Hemiplegia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010243","term":"Paralysis"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","asFound":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12847","name":"Paralysis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
