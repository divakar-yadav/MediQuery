Stroke survivors and their caregivers often experience an overwhelming sense of social isolation and experience a wide range of participation restrictions after stroke, leading to frustration and adverse health outcomes. To address both the survivor and caregiver needs, dyad-focused interventions are necessary to be implemented in the transitioning process. However, very few interventions were designed to address the needs of the dyad and place an equal emphasis on both survivors' and caregivers' outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a newly developed dyad-focused strategy training intervention on enhancing participation of stroke survivors and their caregivers.\n\nTo address this purpose, a single-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be implemented to assess the efficacy of the dyad-focused strategy training intervention in comparison to the control group. An expected sample of 110 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads will be recruited from our collaborative hospitals in Northern Taiwan. These participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. Outcome measures including the Participation Measure- 3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC), and other standardized assessment tools and questionnaires will be administered to the participants at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 3-month (T3), 6-month (T4), and 12-month (T5) follow-ups. Data will be analyzed using multiple linear regression models and mixed-effects regression models.\n\nQualitative in-depth interviews with participants, caregivers, and therapists will be conducted following the intervention. Data regarding the interviewees' experiences, satisfaction, and their perceived effectiveness of the intervention will be collected. Transcribed data will be coded by two independent coders and analyzed with thematic analysis method.\n\nFindings of this study will provide important evidence on whether this newly-developed program has immediate and long-term effect on improving and maintaining participation for both stroke survivors and their caregivers. The mechanism of whether and how this intervention program impacts the dyad's self-efficacy and the functions of stroke survivors in addition to participation will also be identified. These findings will together support the application of the dyad-focused strategy training intervention in rehabilitation practice and inform future study development."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":138,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The dyad-focused strategy training intervention will be delivered to the treatment group.
