Usual care comprises oral anticoagulation and rate control. However, it is unclear, whether early rhythm control therapy reduces the risk of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular outcomes in stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. The Early treatment of Atrial fibrillation for Stroke prevention Trial in acute STROKE (EAST-STROKE) will be an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, blinded outcome assessment (PROBE) interventional multi-center trial to test whether early, comprehensive, rhythm control therapy prevents adverse cardiovascular outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. Primary outcome is a composite of recurrent stroke, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization due to worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome. Secondary outcomes will involve a comprehensive array of clinical and safety parameters, health and socio-economic outcomes including patient reported outcome measures. In an adaptive design, up to 1,746 patients will be enrolled to demonstrate the expected treatment effect with 90% power."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Atrial fibrillation","Rhythm control","Ablation","Antiarrhythmic drugs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1746,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early rhythm control therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF will receive either catheter ablation (mainly pulmonary vein isolation), or adequate antiarrhythmic drug therapy at an early time point.
