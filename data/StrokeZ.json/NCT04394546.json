Lack of resolution of related clinical sequelae or planned and pending interventions to resolve bleeding/bleeding source, are a further exclusion regardless of timing of the bleeding event\n* The subject has an active bleed\n* The subject has a reversible cause of AF or transient AF\n* The subject is absent of a left atrial appendage (LAA) or the LAA is surgically ligated\n* The subject has

enrollment\n* The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an atrial septal device (ASD)/patent foramen ovale (PFO) device\n* The subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position\n* The subject has a known contraindication to percutaneous catheterization procedure\n* The subject has a known contraindication to transesophageal echo (TEE)\n* The subject has a cardiac tumor\n* The subject has signs/symptoms of acute or chronic pericarditis.\n* The subject has an active infection\n* There is evidence of tamponade physiology\n* The subject has New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure at the time of enrollment\n* The subject is of childbearing potential and is, or plans to become, pregnant during the time of the study (method of assessment upon study physician's discretion)\n* The subject has a documented life expectancy of less than 3 years\n\nTransthoracic Echo Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* The subject has left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) \\< 30%\n* The subject has an existing pericardial effusion with a circumferential echo-free space \\> 5mm\n* The subject has a high-risk PFO with an atrial septal aneurysm excursion \\> 15mm or length \\> 15mm\n* The subject has significant mitral valve (MV) stenosis (i.e., MV area \\<1.5 cm2)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
