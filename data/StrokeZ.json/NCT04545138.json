Cognitive function is related to walking ability. The dual task walking is required for daily activities, however, such ability is even more challenging than single walking for people with stroke. The purpose of present study is to investigate the effects of combining cognitive and treadmill training on cognitive function and dual task walking performance in chronic stroke patients with cognitive impairment.","detailedDescription":"This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-measurements. 24 subjects will be recruited, and randomly assigned to one of two groups: cognitive training during treadmill training group (experimental group) and treadmill training group (control group). The intervention for both group will be 30 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week for a total of 4 weeks. Statistical data analysis will use the SPSS 25.0. Baseline characteristics will be analyzed using independent t-test or Chi-square test. Repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc analysis will be used to compare between time and groups. The significant level is set at 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Cognitive and treadmill training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cognitive training during treadmill training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cognitive training combine treadmill training is an intervention that can challenge participants by practicing different tasks simultaneously.","interventionNames":["Other: cognitive training combine treadmill training"]},{"label":"treadmill training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Treadmill training as an active control.","interventionNames":["Other: Treadmill training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"cognitive training combine treadmill training","description":"Treadmill training includes warming up for 3 minutes, training for 25 minutes, and relaxing for 2 minutes.
