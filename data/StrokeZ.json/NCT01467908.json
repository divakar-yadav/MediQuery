Aim of the study: using the navigated brain stimulation system create a new diagnostic model for the differential diagnostics between the vegetative state and the minimally conscious state. If the investigators could get from patient the efferent motor response after a verbal command, his level of conscious should not be defined less than the minimally conscious state."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vegetative State","Stroke","Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Diagnosed vegetative state after stroke or traumatic brain injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vegetative state","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with the diagnosis of the vegetative state","interventionNames":["Device: Navigated transcranial magnetic brain stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Navigated transcranial magnetic brain stimulation","description":"Standard NBS motor mapping using the Eximia TMS stimulator, Nexstim Ltd., Finland.","armGroupLabels":["Vegetative state"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MEP(motor evoked potential) parameter: latency","timeFrame":"within the first minute after a verbal command"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MEP(motor evoked potential) parameter: amplitude","timeFrame":"within the first minute after a verbal command"},{"measure":"MEP(motor evoked potential) parameter: motor threshold","timeFrame":"within the first minute after a verbal command"},{"measure":"conscious state","timeFrame":"within the first 6 months after NBS mapping"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosed vegetative state\n* age 20-85\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* oncological history\n* cardiac pacemakers and other metal implants\n* Modified Ashford Scale scores 3 and more\n* predisposing disease with motor neurologic impairment","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Andrey A Belkin, Prof., MD, Phd","affiliation":"Clinical Institute of Brain, Ural State Medical Academy","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Clinical Institute of Brain","city":"Ekaterinburg","state":"Sverdlovsk region","zip":"620102","country":"Russian Federation","geoPoint":{"lat":56.8519,"lon":60.6122}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Clinical Institute of Brain.
