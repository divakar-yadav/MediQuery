Robots became a promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitation training.","detailedDescription":"The exoskeleton robot ARMin was further developed and software components adapted accordingly to offer a unique intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training of the arm. The goal is to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is meaningful for the individual patient. The study objective is to compare ARMin therapy and a form of conventional occupational therapy that involves both arms regarding change in motor function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Lots will be drawn that assign to either robotic therapy or occupational therapy","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ARMin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Therapy with the arm therapy robot ARMin","interventionNames":["Device: ARMin"]},{"label":"Arm+ occupational therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"a form of conventional occupational therapy that involves both arms","interventionNames":["Other: Occupational Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ARMin","description":"arm therapy robot","armGroupLabels":["ARMin"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Occupational Therapy","description":"bilateral arm training","armGroupLabels":["Arm+ occupational therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment, upper extremity motor function","description":"impairment based clinical test","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ARMin assessment time","description":"time","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"},{"measure":"ARMin assessment torques","description":"torques","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"},{"measure":"ARMin assessment positions","description":"positions","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"},{"measure":"Intrinsic Motivation Inventory","description":"questionnaire","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"},{"measure":"Motor Activity Log","description":"questionnaire","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"},{"measure":"handheld dynamometer","description":"isometric strength","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 3 post-training"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* -
