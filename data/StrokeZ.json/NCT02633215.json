The central hypothesis is that stroke patients with severe motor deficit receiving hand nerve stimulation and intensive task-oriented therapy will have improved motor function compared to patients receiving sham nerve stimulation and task-oriented therapy.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the most devastating and prevalent diseases, but efforts to limit the amount of tissue damaged in the acute phase have been disappointing, highlighting the need for effective therapeutic interventions after neurologic damage has occurred. Data from animal and human models have suggested that sensory input plays an important role in motor output, possibly by influencing cortical plasticity. However, in spite of the advances to date, little is known about the extent to which sensory input in the form of peripheral nerve stimulation can be successfully combined to physical training especially in poorly recovered stroke patients. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sustained peripheral nerve stimulation coupled with functional motor training, to improve hand motor function in stroke patients with severe motor deficit. The central hypothesis is that stroke patients with severe motor deficit receiving hand nerve stimulation and intensive task-oriented therapy will have improved motor function compared to patients receiving sham nerve stimulation and task-oriented therapy, and the degree of this behaviorally-measured effect will correlate with the neurophysiological effect measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["motor recovery","neuroplasticity","chronic","human","sensory"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active stimulation with motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 hours of active peripheral nerve stimulation (intervention) paired with 4 hours of intensive task-oriented upper extremity training.
