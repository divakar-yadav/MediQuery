To address this, stroke patients need a rehabilitation method they can use on their own, without direct clinical supervision, and for activities of daily living.

The Upper Extremity component (UEFM) consists of 33 items with a score range of 0-66.

The UEFM assesses capacity of the arm primarily through gross motor tasks, and comparatively few grasping and pinching tasks. Thus, it was presumed that robotic assistance would have minimal influence on UEFM scores.
