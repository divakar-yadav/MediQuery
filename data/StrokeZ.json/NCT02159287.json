Oral anticoagulation (Warfarin) is recommended for prevention of recurrent embolic stroke but it takes several days to reach a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR : 2.5) so bridging therapy with a short acting intravenous anticoagulant is recommended until therapeutic INR level is reached. A common strategy is to use intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) until a standard activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is reached and then initiating warfarin. Another strategy is to use subcutaneous (SQ) injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) eg. Enoxaparin.\n\nThe investigators will compare LMWH and UFH, focusing on risk of new stroke and mortality rate.\n\nMETHOD: This study is randomized controlled trial that will be performed in 80 patients ages between 18 and 75 with confirmed acute ischemic stroke purely due to AF who will be hospitalized in Shiraz Medical University affiliated teaching hospitals. Patients will be randomly assigned in two groups. A brain CT will be done to confirm the absence of intracranial hemorrhage and to assess the size of cerebral ischemia.\n\nFirst group will receive 1 mg of enoxaparin (Clexane, Sanofi, Paris) per kilogram of body weight SQ every 12 hour with warfarin 5mg orally everyday and both drugs will be continued until the target INR level (2.5) is reached then clexane will be discontinued.\n\nThe second group will receive continuous UFH infusion 1000 unit per hour and then the dose will be adjusted to maintain a therapeutic aPTT (two times to baseline) level then warfarin will be started (5 mg everyday).\n\nThe investigators will follow patients in both groups until target INR will be achieved (2.5) and after that clexane and UFH will be discontinued. Adverse events will be assessed in both groups for three months.\n\nData will be analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15 and Chi-square statistics.\n\nMain outcome of our study will be evaluation of new stroke, mortality, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, major bleeding, drop out and other unwanted side effects in first week and three months after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Embolic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","atrial fibrillation","bridging therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low molecular-weight heparin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"these patients will receive 1 mg of enoxaparin (clexane) per kilogram of body weight subcutaneous every 12 hour with warfarin 5mg QD and both drugs will be continued until the target INR level (2.5) is reached then clexane will be discontinued.","interventionNames":["Drug: Enoxaparin"]},{"label":"unfractionated heparin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin sodium infusion 1000 unit per hour initially and then the dose will be adjusted to maintain a therapeutic aPTT level (two times to baseline) then warfarin will be started (5 mg QD).","interventionNames":["Drug: Heparin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Enoxaparin","description":"1 mg of enoxaparin per kilogram of body weight subcutaneous every 12 hour","armGroupLabels":["Low molecular-weight heparin"],"otherNames":["clexane (Clexane, Sanofi, Paris)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Heparin","description":"1000 unit per hour continuous intravenous infusion of heparin sodium","armGroupLabels":["unfractionated heparin"],"otherNames":["Heparin Sodium (Alborz Darou,Tehran)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mortality","description":"all death cases are included but only mortality due to cerebrovascular accident are considered.","timeFrame":"up to the 3 months of follow-up"},{"measure":"ischemic stroke","description":"Ischemic strokes are those that are caused by interruption of the blood supply","timeFrame":"up to the 3 months of follow-up"},{"measure":"hemorrhagic stroke","description":"hemorrhagic strokes are the ones which result from rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure.","timeFrame":"up to the 3 months of follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"symptomatic CNS hemorrhage","description":"Intracranial bleeding occurs when a blood vessel within the skull is ruptured or leaks that causes neurological symptoms.
