However, the mechanisms, and their specificity, by which fluoxetine improves motor function after stroke remain poorly understood.\n\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to better characterize the mechanisms of action of fluoxetine in motor recovery and more specifically to identify the neurophysiological substrate underlying fluoxetine-induced motor recovery in stroke.\n\nThe corticospinal system plays a key role in voluntary activation of upper limb muscles. Its integrity has been related to spontaneous (but incomplete) recovery after stroke. So far, the effect of fluoxetine on corticospinal excitability and integrity has been poorly explored although this drug appears promising to promote motor recovery.\n\nIn this study, the investigators propose to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess the effect of a chronic treatment of fluoxetine on corticospinal excitability and integrity. The investigators believe that this approach will be suitable to determine the mechanisms of action of this drug on motor recovery after stroke.\n\nThe investigators will assess in a double-blind, monocentric (Saint-Anne Hospital Stroke center), randomised, placebo-controlled study, the effect of a chronic treatment of fluoxetine on corticospinal excitability and integrity using TMS in 40 patients suffering from ischaemic stroke with hemiplegia or hemiparesis affecting motor hand functions.\n\nBy coupling TMS, visuomotor grip tracking task and several clinical scales, the investigators' results will allow a more system-specific assessment than the Fugl-Meyer motor scale of fluoxetine-induced motor hand recovery in stroke. We believe that this study will support the beneficial effect of fluoxetine to promote motor recovery in stroke and will open new vistas for treatment options using fluoxetine in patients with motor impairments. It is expected that this study will provide preliminary data that will be subsequently used to design new, more focused, clinical trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Motor recovery","Fluoxetine","Transcranial magnetic stimulation","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fluoxetine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoxetine"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo of fluoxetine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fluoxetine","description":"1 pill of 20mg / day, during 3 months","armGroupLabels":["Fluoxetine"],"otherNames":["Patients receiving fluoxetine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo of fluoxetine","description":"1 pill of 20mg/day, during 3 months","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Patients receiving placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Slope of the curve of recruitment of the PEMs","description":"Significant difference, between the treated group and the group control, of the slope of the curve of recruitment of the PEMs between the beginning (D0) and the end of the treatment (processing) (M3).","timeFrame":"M3"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Slope of recruitment of the PEMs","description":"Effect of a first dose of fluoxétine on the slope of recruitment of the PEMs.","timeFrame":"D0, M3, M6"},{"measure":"Slope of recruitment of the PEMs","description":"Persistence of fluoxétine effect on the slope of recruitment of the PEMs to M6.","timeFrame":"D0, M3, M6"},{"measure":"Index finger force control in paretic hand under time-course of treatment of Fluoxetine","description":"A visuomotor tracking task is used to measure accuracy of force control (NewtonSecond, Ns) and time taken to release force (release duration, ms).
