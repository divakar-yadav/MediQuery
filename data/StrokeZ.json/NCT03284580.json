Caregivers of post-stroke patients often have also problems with their quality of life because of the care that they must provide. These problems appear mainly during the support tasks in the activities performed at the patient's home.\n\nThe objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two home-based ergonomic intervention programs compared to a control group on the quality of life of caregivers of post-stroke patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Quality of Life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ergonomic intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ergonomic intervention program at home for caregivers","interventionNames":["Other: Ergonomic intervention"]},{"label":"Postural + kinesiotherapy intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A postural + kinesiotherapy intervention program at home for caregivers","interventionNames":["Other: Postural plus kinesiotherapy intervention program"]},{"label":"Control or conservative group","type":"OTHER","description":"A conservative intervention by general information for caregivers","interventionNames":["Other: Control or conservative intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ergonomic intervention","description":"An ergonomic intervention program focused to caregivers, including recommendation about how they should help themself and the patients activities at home.","armGroupLabels":["Ergonomic intervention group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Postural plus kinesiotherapy intervention program","description":"An ergonomic intervention program focused to caregivers, including recommendation about how they should help themself and the patients activities at home.","armGroupLabels":["Postural + kinesiotherapy intervention group"],"otherNames":["A postural plus kinesiotherapy intervention program, including excercises for caregivers"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control or conservative intervention","description":"A control or conservative intervention, including general information about stroke disease for the caregivers of these patients","armGroupLabels":["Control or conservative group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from WhoQol-Bref at 8 weeks","description":"This test measures quality of life","timeFrame":"Eight weeks"},{"measure":"Change from WhoQol-Bref at 16 weeks","description":"This test measures quality of life","timeFrame":"Sixteen weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from ergonomic evaluation of the domestic environment at 8 weeks","description":"This measurement evaluates if domestic environment is ergonomic","timeFrame":"Eight weeks"},{"measure":"Change from ergonomic evaluation of the domestic environment at 16 weeks","description":"This measurement evaluates if domestic environment is ergonomic","timeFrame":"Sixteen weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being caregivers of post-stroke patients\n* Being over 18 years old\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being caregiver of patients with other neurological patients","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"José Manuel Pérez Mármol","city":"Córdoba","zip":"18007","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":37.89155,"lon":-4.77275}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29452985","type":"DERIVED","citation":"de Araujo Freitas Moreira KL, Abalos-Medina GM, Villaverde-Gutierrez C, Gomes de Lucena NM, Belmont Correia de Oliveira A, Perez-Marmol JM.
