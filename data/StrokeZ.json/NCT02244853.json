CALIBER links patient records from four different data sources: Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), MINAP (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project registry) Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES), the Office for National Statistics (ONS).","detailedDescription":"This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stable Angina","Myocardial Infarction","Coronary Heart Disease","Heart Failure","Stroke","Death, Sudden, Cardiac","Peripheral Arterial Disease","Atrial Fibrillation","Bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51703,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with low and high heart rate and stable coronary artery disease","description":"Participants were followed until their first cardiovascular or complication event after their studyentry and after at least one previous cardiovascular event.
