Strategies that improve the blood pressure control of patients with hemorrhagic stroke during the first hours of hospitalization are determinant in controlling the hematoma expansion and determining factor in its prognosis. This study was designed with the objective of evaluating the beneficial effects of combining esmolol hydrochloride with sodium nitroprusside for the blood pressure control of participants with hemorrhagic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Participants with parenchymal intracranial hemorrhage (diagnosis confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and:\n\n* with systolic
