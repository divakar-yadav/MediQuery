Evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin taye 9 inhibitor, can significantly reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and has a positive effect on improving cardiovascular events. However, existing studies have focused almost exclusively on the long-term effects of Evolocumab, and the early effects of Evolocumab on AIS patients remains unclear.","detailedDescription":"Patients aged 18-80 years old admitted to the Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, with a definite diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and receiving lipid-lowering therapy with statins with or without evolocumab will be included in this study. Participants will be divided into two groups according to the lipid-lowering therapy they used: 1) statin-alone group: the participants receive statins alone (atorvastatin 20mg qn or rosuvastatin 10mg qn or pivastatin 2mg qn) for lipid reduction, and 2) PCSK9-i group: the participants receive statins (atorvastatin 20mg qn or rosuvastatin 10mg qn or pivastatin 2mg qn) and evolocumab (140mg twice a month) for lipid reduction. Most importantly, the lipid-lowering therapy of participants will be decided only by clinicians not involved in the study, not by the investigators. The levels of blood lipid (TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, Apo AI and Apo B) and inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP and IL-6) of these participants at different time points (day 1, day 3, day 5, and month 3) will be recorded. The target level of LDL-C is the LDL-C reduction ≥50% from the baseline and LDL-C\\<1.4mmol/L (55mg/dL). In addition, the cardiovascular events and adverse drug reactions of these participants during follow-up will also be recorded. During the follow-up period (3 months), participants who changed their lipid-lowering regimen, including the type, dosage and frequency of statins and evolocumab, will be excluded from the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Evolocumab","PCSK9
