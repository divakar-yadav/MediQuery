Community rehabilitation programs for stroke individuals in the chronic stage are often difficult to be implement. Consequently, many individuals remain without structured interventional programs. Self-training programs, where individuals can independently continue to exercise at home, might answer this challenge. However, since exercising alone is boring and not motivating, individuals often stop the prescribed exercises and remain inactive. The use of video-games for self-training might answer this challenge.\n\nTherefore, the investigators aimed to assess the feasibility of using video-games for self-training after stroke. Specifically the investigators aim to compare the (1) training time, (2) satisfaction and (3) effectiveness of a self-training program using video-games compared to a traditional self-training program.","detailedDescription":"This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial with four assessments; two before and two following the 5-week self training intervention.\n\nIndividuals are requested to perform the self training (video-games or traditional exercises) 60 minutes a day for 5 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"self-training using video-games","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive a video-game console and will be asked to play video-games for one hour a day X 6 days a week for 5 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: self-training using video-games"]},{"label":"traditional self-training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive a manual and kit of a traditional self-training program and will be asked to perform the program one hour a day X 6 days a week for 5 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: traditional self-training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"self-training using video-games","description":"Individuals will receive a video-game console and will be taught how to play the games.\n\nThey will be requested to play 60 minutes a day for 5 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["self-training using video-games"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"traditional self-training","description":"Individuals will receive a manual and equipment and will be taught how to perform the exercises.
