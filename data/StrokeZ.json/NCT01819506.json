This study will investigate the effects of a challenging 4-week physical rehabilitation therapy program that is targeted at specific movement impairments and systematically progressed to assure an ongoing \"just right\" level of rigor. The investigators anticipate that therapy targeted to address specific movement impairments will improve recovery of arm/hand movement in people who have had a stroke.","detailedDescription":"The overwhelming majority of individuals who survive stroke have persistent upper extremity (UE) motor deficits which interfere with re-engagement in meaningful activities. While advances from neuroscience are spurring development of new rehabilitation strategies, the development of novel measurement methods has not kept pace. Currently, there is no comprehensive measurement framework to objectively quantify impairment, match a rehabilitation therapy program to a patient's impairment level, and measure specific therapy effects. Therefore there has not been a rehabilitation trial where a measurement framework is the basis for designing the treatment as well as defining the outcome. The investigators redesigned the Fugl-Meyer UE Assessment (FMA-UE) using item response theory Rasch analysis and developed a first of its kind measurement framework that locates a patient along a continuum of impairment and directs a personalized therapy program tailored to patients' specific impairments and ability levels. The purpose of this proposed research is to empirically test this framework.\n\nThe objective of this project is to empirically test the FMA-UE measurement framework.\n\nThis study hypothesizes that therapeutic task practice at the just-right challenge of difficulty will maximize post-stroke motor skill reacquisition. It is expected that \"targeted task-practice\", will increase UE motor ability because task goal difficulty will be matched and systematically progressed according to patients' initial and evolving levels of ability.\n\nThis is a single-blinded study with parallel arm design, stratified sampling and blocked randomization. 120 individuals with post-stroke UE hemiparesis will be enrolled; 40 participants per 3 UE impairment levels as defined by the investigators' measurement framework. Participants will engage in 12 sessions (3x/wk for 4 weeks, 2 hrs/session) of reach-to-grasp task-practice. Within each impairment level, subjects will be randomized to a treatment group; 20 to targeted task-practice and 20 to non-targeted task-practice. Targeted task-practice is personalized to patient-specific UE motor deficits with initial targets (goals) defined according to baseline measures and targets continually progressed after every 3 therapy sessions so that the goals match the patient's evolving level of ability. Non-targeted task practice is defined as a standard of care task-practice intervention intended to increase UE use but not alter specific impairments. Data analyses will include (1) ANOVA to test the effects of targeted vs. non-targeted therapy on UE motor ability, (2) multiple regression to model the relationship between therapy and movement adaptions occurring pre- to post-rehabilitation, and (3) growth mixture modeling to define responders and non-responders.\n\nThis project is significant because there is a pressing need for a comprehensive measurement framework to guide novel interventions designed to improve post-stroke UE motor function and define their effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","occupational therapy","upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":103,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Targeted Task Practice","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Targeted task practice is defined as a therapy program aimed at patient-specific upper extremity motor impairment levels and systematically progressed to assure an ongoing \"just right\" match between task-difficulty and patient-ability.
