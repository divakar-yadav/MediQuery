Movement impairments are typically treated with intensive, hands-on physical and occupational therapy for several weeks after the initial brain injury. Unfortunately, due to economic pressure on the U.S. health care system, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home sooner. Our goal for this study is to develop an upper extremity robotic training system for both acute and chronic stroke population to improve movement ability with intensive and repetitive movement in the clinic without continuous supervision from a therapist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["stroke","cerebrovascular accident","robot"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic group (Type I)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Type I Robotic Therapy (Functional activities first) Participants in this group will participate in functional/task-oriented multi-joint training with the BONES robot first, followed by individual joint training with the BONES robot.
