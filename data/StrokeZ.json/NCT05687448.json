Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are currently the only oral anticoagulants approved for mechanical prosthetic valve-implanted patients. As effective as these anticoagulants are, they have major drawbacks: narrow therapeutic window, variable dose-response in individuals, interaction with several foods and drugs. Achieved INR is frequently outside the target range and INR instability is a predictor of bleeding and late mortality in patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis. Despite multiple studies that show that tissue valves have a limited durability, many patients sometimes even young choose this type of valve to avoid VKAs.\n\nIn randomized studies and registries, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have demonstrated their superiority to reduce bleeding in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation compared to VKAs with similar efficacy and are recommended as first choice in the guidelines. Apixaban has demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile to reduce bleeding in the different indications (ranging from 25-50%). So far, DOACs are currently contra-indicated or not indicated in patients with a mechanical prosthesis. The results of a single small-sized phase II randomized trial testing an anti-IIa drug were disappointing and anti-Xa drugs have not been appropriately evaluated in patients with a mechanical prosthesis. Only small observational series suggest encouraging results with anti-Xa DOACs.\n\nOngoing randomized trials are conducted with DOACs compared to warfarin but the studies only include one type of mechanical aortic valve or mechanical valve in mitral position. Moreover, these studies are underpowered to completely answer the question about clinical ischemic and bleeding outcomes.\n\nThen, there is an unmet clinical need for an alternative to VKAs, such as an anti-Xa DOAC like apixaban, as anticoagulation in patients with a mechanical aortic prosthetic valve. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with mechanical prosthetic valve in the aortic position at least 7 days after cardiac surgery can be maintained effectively with a better safety (net clinical benefit) on apixaban compared to warfarin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Disease"],"keywords":["Anticoagulant","Aortic valve","Warfarine","Apixaban","Stroke","Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study is a national, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, open label study in patients (aged ≥18 years) with mechanical aortic valve at least 7 days after cardiac surgery.\n\nExperimental group:\n\nPatients treated with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (BID)\n\nActive Comparator group:\n\nPatients treated with warfarin with an objective of INR target of 2.5 (range: 2.0-3.0)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The Outcomes adjudication will be performed blinded of patients treatment"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1044,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients treated with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (BID)","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban 5 MG Oral Tablet"]},{"label":"Active Comparator group:","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients treated with warfarin with an objective of INR target of 2.5 (range: 2.0-3.0)","interventionNames":["Drug: warfarin with an objective of INR target of 2.5 (range: 2.0-3.0)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban 5 MG Oral Tablet","description":"Patients treated with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (BID)","armGroupLabels":["Experimental Group"],"otherNames":["Experimental Group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"warfarin with an objective of INR target of 2.5 (range: 2.0-3.0)","description":"Patients treated with warfarin with an objective of INR target of 2.5 (range: 2.0-3.0)","armGroupLabels":["Active Comparator group:"],"otherNames":["Active Comparator"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Net Adverse Clinical Events (NACE)","description":"The primary composite endpoint is a net clinical endpoint including a composite ischemic endpoint (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism and valve thrombosis) and bleeding (ISTH major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding)","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bleeding","description":"Bleeding (ISTH major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding)","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"},{"measure":"MACE","description":"Ischemic endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism and valve thrombosis)","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"},{"measure":"Death","description":"All cause-death","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"},{"measure":"Valve thrombosis","description":"Aortic Valve thrombosis adapted from VARC-3 definition","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"},{"measure":"Echographic parameter of aortic valve","description":"Mean aortic gradient (mmHg) during follow-up","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"},{"measure":"Echographic parameter of aortic valve","description":"Peak velocity (m/s) during follow-up","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"},{"measure":"Quality-of-life questionary","description":"Quality of life measured with the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) scaled from 0 to 100","timeFrame":"Up to 48 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
