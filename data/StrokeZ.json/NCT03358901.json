A neuroprotectant, YC-6, showed therapeutic effects in preclinical animal models of AIS, indicating its potential as alternative or combined treatment against human AIS.\n\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to explore safety and tolerability in healthy Chinese adult volunteers with dose-escalating intravenous infusion of YC-6 for 7 consecutive days. 6 subjects for YC-6 and 2 for placebo will be allocated in each level. Blood and urine samples of each subject will be used in determination of pharmacokinetic properties of the investigational drug."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"YC-6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"6 volunteers in each level will be infused 100, 200, 400, or 600 mg of YC-6 over 7 consecutive days: BID within 30 minutes for the first 6 days and QD on the 7th day.","interventionNames":["Drug: YC-6"]},{"label":"Vehicle","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"2 volunteers in each level will be infused 2, 4, 8, or 12 g of vehicle over 7 consecutive days: BID within 30 minutes for the first 6 days and QD on the 7th day.","interventionNames":["Drug: Vehicle"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"YC-6","armGroupLabels":["YC-6"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vehicle","armGroupLabels":["Vehicle"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants who experience treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)","description":"Any untoward medical events during this study were categorized as severe, moderate, or mild, and related or not related to study treatment.","timeFrame":"Day 0 to Day 11"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Plasma Concentration of YC-6","description":"Concentration of YC-6 in plasma of every subject will be measured during day 0 to day 8.","timeFrame":"Day 0 to Day 8"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18\\~55 years old healthy subjects\n2.
