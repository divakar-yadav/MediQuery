BNP is of high sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of cardiac function. SVV and CVP are dynamic and static indices to predict fluid responsiveness. TTE is a good indicator of volume and cardiac function.Thus, we conducted the trial to assess the perioperative circulatory function in patients undergoing LPC. We hypothesized that long term pneumoperitoneum and steep trendelenburg in LPC for bladder cancer would increase perioperative blood volume and influence cardiac function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Circulatory Function","Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy for Bladder Cancer"],"keywords":["brain natriuretic peptide","pneumoperitoneum","Trendelenburg","circulatory function","laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer","central venous pressure","stroke volume variation","transthoracic echocardiography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":186,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain Natriuretic Peptide(BNP)","description":"To observe the change of BNP perioperatively.","timeFrame":"before induction (T1), at the end of operation(T2), at 12 hours (T3) and 24 hours (T4) postoperatively"},{"measure":"Central Venous Pressure(CVP)","description":"To observe the change of CVP perioperatively.","timeFrame":"before induction (T1),at the end of operation (T2), at 12 hours (T3) and 24 hours (T4) postoperatively"},{"measure":"Stroke Volume Variation(SVV)","description":"To observe the change of SVV perioperatively.","timeFrame":"before induction (T1), at the end of operation (T2)"},{"measure":"Transthoracic Echocardiography","description":"To observe the change of End-diastolic volume(EDV) perioperatively","timeFrame":"before induction (T1),at the end of operation (T2), at 12 hours (T3) and 24 hours (T4) postoperatively"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* undergoing laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer\n* ASA I-II\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cardiac insufficiency\n* Hepatic insufficiency\n* Renal insufficiency","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients who undergo laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in Renji Hospital","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jie Chen, MS","affiliation":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China","city":"Shanghai","state":"Shanghai","zip":"200127","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":31.22222,"lon":121.45806}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001749","term":"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014571","term":"Urologic Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000014565","term":"Urogenital Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000052776","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000001745","term":"Urinary Bladder Diseases"},{"id":"D000014570","term":"Urologic Diseases"},{"id":"D000052801","term":"Male Urogenital Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4720","name":"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms","asFound":"Bladder Cancer","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13607","name":"Pneumoperitoneum","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17010","name":"Urologic Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17005","name":"Urogenital Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2876","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26783","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13817","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8089","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4716","name":"Urinary Bladder Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17009","name":"Urologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26785","name":"Male Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21625","name":"Natriuretic Peptide, Brain","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"NaAg","name":"Natriuretic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
