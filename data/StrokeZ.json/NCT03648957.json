This study will evaluate the feasibility and effect of an early initiated counselling intervention targeting smoking, physical activity, and adherence to preventive medication, with regular follow-up sessions, in patients with acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack who are discharged home.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and loss of independence worldwide. In Denmark 12,000 people have a stroke per year. About one fourth of patients admitted with a stroke have had previous strokes or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The risk of recurrent stroke is highest in the first weeks and decreasing with time.\n\nIn the last decades there has been an increased focus on the importance of health behaviour in the public and among patients in relations to prevention of vascular diseases. There is solid scientific evidence of the harmful effects of lifestyle factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity, and alcohol overuse.\n\nHypertension is one of the leading risk factors for vascular diseases, including stroke and TIA. Lowering of the blood pressure is therefore an essential part of stroke treatment. Smoking cessation, physical activity, and adherence to antihypertensive and antithrombotic medication is highly recommended in patients with minor stroke and TIA.\n\nThere is still a lack of knowledge about how to support patients in making suitable choices to prevent recurrence and progression of their disease. Previous research has shown varying results and it is therefore difficult to point out any specific intervention or element of interventions which would be feasible to implement in clinical practice.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that early client-centred patient counselling with repeated follow-up sessions after discharge can reduce the blood pressure through smoking cessation, physical activity, and improved adherence to preventive medication in patients with minor stroke and transient ischemic attacks compared to simple encouragement to lifestyle change.\n\nThe overall purpose of our research is to develop effective and clinically feasible interventions to prevent recurrent strokes in patients with minor stroke and transient ischemic attacks, and identify unmet needs in the newly discharged patients and their relatives.\n\nThe PhD study will comprise of 1) a randomized feasibility trial (n=40) aiming to test a combined behavioural and clinical intervention with follow-up sessions post-discharge with 3-4 weeks intervals in 12 weeks on reducing blood pressure in patients with minor stroke and transient ischemic attack 2) a qualitative study to explore the patients attitudes and experiences towards medicine adherence, lifestyle changes, social support, and self-efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Behavioral intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Usual stroke service care plus additional lifestyle counselling focusing on smoking cessation, physical activity, and adherence to preventive medication.
