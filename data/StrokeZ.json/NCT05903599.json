Damage to the motor cortex and the pyramidal tract due to a stroke leads to a motor control disorders and co-contraction of trunk muscles due to abnormal levels of abdominal muscle tension and voluntary movement.","detailedDescription":"TDCS is known to modulate motor excitability in humans and motor performance is crucial in postural control. Studies reports that applying anodal TDCS to the ipsilesional motor cortex improved motor functioning in which the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation may have stimulated preserved areas of the motor cortex to enhance synaptic efficiency along the corticospinal tract.\n\nAnodal TDCS has been shown to have immediate and short-term effects in stroke but its long-term effects in stroke are still unclear. Additionally, the available literature focuses on acute and chronic stages of stroke so we will target subacute stage of stroke. Therefore, this study is designed to investigate the short and long-term effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on postural stability in subacute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"anodal Transcranial direct current stimulation with saline soaked sponges will be used on electrodes, for 20 mins in addition to the 60 mins of conventional treatment.","interventionNames":["Other: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"A sham stimulation will be given.

The patients are asked to stand up from chair, walk to a line of 3 meters length at a normal pace, turn and walk back to the chair at your normal pace and sit down.

The patient is instructed to stand next to but not touching a wall and position the arm that is closer to the wall at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with a closed fist. The assessor records the starting position at the third metacarpal head on the yardstick. Instruct the patient to reach as far as you can forward without taking a step. The location of the third metacarpal is recorded. Scores are determined by assessing the difference between the start and end positions in the reach distance usually measured in inches. Three trials should be done and the average of the last two is noted.

It contains 49 items in 12 domains: mobility, energy, upper extremity function (5 items), work/productivity (3 items ), mood (5 items), social roles (5 items),family roles (3 items ), language (5 items ), thinking (3 items), personality (3 items) higher scores indicate better functioning.
