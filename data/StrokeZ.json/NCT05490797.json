Data will be collected from Jinnah hospital Lahore and Riphah Rehabilitation center Lahore. All 22 patients will be taken using random sampling. Both study groups will be given common treatment of conventional hand function. The subjects will randomly assign to the experiment group with mobile apps training and the control group without mobile app training. Mobile applications like Dexteria, ScribbleKid, PegLight and Bowling game will be used for the purpose of training and success rate will be considered as outcome measure. Test and tools include the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), the Fugl-Meyer Motor assessment (FMA), The Box \\&amp; Block Test (BBT), and Grip strength will be assessed using a hand dynamometer. SPSS 25 version will be used for data entry and analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Skill, Social","Occlusion"],"keywords":["Stroke, Ischemic","Skill, Social","Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"total 22 participants will be enrolled.
