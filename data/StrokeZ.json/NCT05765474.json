Participants will be randomized into two groups. Experimental and control groups will differ by one practice variable that will not be disclosed until completion of testing procedures. Participants will practice a motor task using both their more and less affected arms for two consecutive days. A Pre-Test will be administered on Day 1 before the training begins. Immediate Transfer of Learning will be administered on Day 2 after the completion of training. Delayed (24-hour) Retention and Transfer Tests will be administered on Day 3.","detailedDescription":"Stroke involves loss of blood flow to the brain and can cause impaired upper limb motor function, resulting in long term disability. Targeted motor learning interventions can improve skill acquisition and functional upper limb use after stroke. For example, repetitive practice of a motor task has been shown to improve motor learning outcomes. However, more research is currently needed to identify important active ingredients in complex motor learning interventions and determine the most effective approaches for improving upper limb recovery after stroke. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a specific practice variable on motor learning for individuals with upper limb hemiparesis after stroke. This research will inform the development of future stroke rehabilitation interventions aimed at improving skill acquisition and motor learning."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Rehabilitation","Motor Learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Research participants will be blinded to the overall purpose of the study and will not be informed of the difference between the groups.
