The perturbation based training focuses on challenging patients with unexpected movements to improve their balance and stability. While the Bobath method, concentrating on facilitating normal movement patterns. The study aims to determine which approach yields better outcomes in terms of trunk control, balance, and functional recovery for stroke patients. This study will also enable the individual to be more independent and minimize their falls.","detailedDescription":"Cerebrovascular is a leading cause of physical impairment and long-term disability in the globe. The complication of stroke is mobility impairment like balance, gait, and posture disorders. This impairment leads to a higher risk of falls, reduced ability in daily activities, and difficulty restoring the overall health and quality of life. Cerebrovascular accident is the second cause of fatality.Hence, one of the primary objectives in stroke rehabilitation is to restore postural stability and functional balance, which is a combination of dynamic, static and reactive balance. For improving postural stability and balance one such technique is the utilization of a rocker board, where a platform positioned on an unstable surface is used to challenge balance. Whilst rocker boards have been used effectively for, postural stability, injury prevention, rehabilitation and balance enhancement. Improvements in rocker board performance may be attributable to one or more of the following: muscle strengthening, enhanced intersegmental coordination, increase in brain activity in the supplementary motor area and/or enhanced feed-forward and feed-backward postural control mechanisms. Postural instability limits lower limb functional activities, hence; rapid and optimal improvement of postural control in stroke patients is essential for their independence, social participation and general health. Improvement in postural stability have a great impact upon balance and gait. Rocker board training is also effective for gait and trunk balance in stroke patients.Several approaches have been utilized to improve these impairments, including perturbation-based training and Bobath-based trunk techniques. Perturbation-based training involves exposing patients to external disturbances that challenge their balance and require them to actively respond and adjust their movements. The goal of this training is to improve patients' ability to recover from balance perturbations and reduce their risk of falling. This training aims to activate the adaptive response to external forces, thereby improving motor function and balance control. Bobath-based trunk techniques, on the other hand, focus on modifying the posture and alignment of the trunk and pelvis to enhance the patient's movement patterns and functional goals.Through this study we want to improve postural stability through rocker based training as well from bobath based training and ultimately patient's dynamic balance and gait so functional capability of stroke patients can be enhanced."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"participants and outcome assessors will be kept blinded about the intervention which the patients will be going to recieve.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":58,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"perturbation based training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
