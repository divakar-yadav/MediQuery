A group of 700 patients and a group of 100 healthy volunteers will be participating.","detailedDescription":"In the Netherlands an estimated 650.000 people live with the daily consequences of an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). A substantial amount of these patients acquired their brain injury (traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage or cerebrovascular accident) at a relatively young age: between 18 and 50 years old. The chain-of-care for ABI aims for recovery in the subacute phase, usually within a period of one year after injury. After an adaptation period, the patients reach a new balance, with stabilization of complaints and reintegration, sometimes with the necessity of modifications. The group of patients who acquired a brain injury at a young age, have to face the effects of aging like decreased cognitive functions, which can cause the participation level to drop. This is called the ABI-effect in the current study. At this moment, insufficient information is available about the functioning of people who suffered ABI multiple years ago and have established a new balance, and now make the transition to an older phase of live.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nExplore the prevalence of the ABI-effect, by mapping the participation level.\n\nSecondary objective:\n\nSubstantiate the occurence of the ABI-effect, by mapping cognitive functions of patients and compare these to healthy controls.\n\nTertiary objective:\n\nGain insight in the need of care for patients, to enhance regular care after ABI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acquired Brain Injury","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Traumatic Brain Injury","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":800,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acquired Brain Injury Patients","description":"Questionnaire and, if the requirements are met, a neuropsychological assessment."},{"label":"Healthy volunteers","description":"Questionnaire and, if the requirements are met, a neuropsychological assessment."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of the ABI-effect","description":"The percentage of patients experiencing the ABI-effect.
