To identify correlations between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments in stroke.\n2. To identify possible patterns between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments that might increase our understanding in stroke recovery and guide further tailor-based neuro-rehabilitation","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to investigate arm and hand function after stroke and how the location of the brain lesion affects arm and hand function. We are hoping to collect data in the form of assessments what you feel and how your arm moves, surveys about activities in daily life and well-being, and we will perform 1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. MRI scans are loud but painless; nothing is injected. With MRI, we collect images from the brain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"20 patients who are at least 6 months post stroke.
