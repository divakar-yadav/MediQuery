Since the treatment should be initiated between 8 and 24 hours from stroke onset, the screening window is limited and all procedures should be performed as soon as possible. All screened patients will be identified by patient number and will sign the informed consent prior to any study procedure initiation.\n\nPeriod 1: Day 1-5\n\nDay 1- Eligible subjects will be randomized to:\n\n* Group 1: Implantation and ISS Stimulation during five consecutive days \\& Standard of Care\n* Group 2: Sham Implantation and Sham Stimulation during five consecutive days \\& Standard of Care Subjects will be transferred to the implantation procedure facility and the implantation/sham implantation will be performed by a trained physician.\n\nAfter implantation, active/sham stimulation will be administered in daily 4-hour sessions, beginning immediately following the placement procedure and continuing for 5 consecutive days.\n\nDay 5 / Day of Discharge. Following the last ISS /Sham Stimulation, explantation will be performed and the patients will be evaluated for safety and effectiveness.\n\nSubjects will continue with Standard of Care as needed and will be released from the hospital upon investigator's judgment.\n\nPeriod 2: Day of Discharge - 89±7 days During this period both groups (ISS Stimulation and Sham Control) will be treated according to Standard of Care either at the hospital, rehabilitation center or at home.\n\nScheduled visits will be performed on day 30±7 and day 60 ±7, which will include safety and effectiveness assessments.\n\nFinal Visit Day 90±7 days: The final visit will be performed at the study site and will include safety and effectiveness evaluations.\n\nPatients will be contacted by study personnel via telephone on Day 180±7 and on Day 360±7 in order to assess their quality of life status."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","randomized clinical trial","effectiveness","safety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1078,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Implantation/ISS Stimulation during 5 consecutive days \\& Standard of Care (SoC).\n\nDay 1: First stimulation initiated within 24 hours from stroke onset, following implantation completion.
