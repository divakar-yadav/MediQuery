It includes the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Go4Life® Exercise \\& Physical Activity materials 3 and WHISH developed targeted materials based on Go4Life® to provide inspirational tips and recommendations about how to achieve nationally recommended levels of PA and overcome barriers to exercise, with a means for self-monitoring and setting personal goals. The intervention builds upon evidence-based behavioral science principles and intervention components that have proven to be effective in increasing PA in older women, with innovative adaptive approaches to tailoring the delivery to meet individual (personal) needs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Cardiovascular Mortality","Hip Fractures","Falls","Mortality","Venous Thromboembolic Event","Peripheral Artery Disease","Physical Function","Coronary Revascularization","Mobility and Independence","Clinical (Non-hip) Fractures","Sleep","Depressive Symptoms"],"keywords":["Physical Activity","National Institute of Aging Go4Life","Postmenopausal Women","Balance","Strength","Exercise","Cardiovascular Disease","Stroke","Mortality","Myocardial Infarction","Falls","Venous Thromboembolic Event","Peripheral Artery Disease","Physical Function","Mobility and Independence","Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)","Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)","Hip Fractures","Cardiovascular Mortality","Clinical (non-hip) Fractures","Sleep","Depressive Symptoms"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":49331,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Physical Activity Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Physical Activity Intervention Group will receive guidance on being physically active, including aerobics, flexibility, balance, strength, and decreased sedentary time.
