An association between patent foramen ovale and severe migraine headaches has also been reported. Several implantable devices are being used for percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale; we propose to use a non-implantable system to safely effect closure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Foramen Ovale, Patent"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"PFX Closure System"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PFO closure as measured by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) acutely post procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PFO closure as measured by TEE or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at 30 days, 3 or 6 months and 12 months post procedure"},{"measure":"Adverse event (AE) rates for all subjects"},{"measure":"New conduction abnormality rate through final follow-up"},{"measure":"Measurement of migraine severity or frequency at 6 and 12 months post procedure for subjects enrolled due to diagnosis of migraine"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject is between 18 and 65 years old\n* Documented patent foramen ovale as determined by positive micro bubble study demonstrating right to left shunt and/or anatomic detection and functional assessment by pre-operative transcranial Doppler (TCD) and peri-operative echocardiography or ultrasound.\n* Subjects with one or more of the following:\n\n  * history of cryptogenic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or embolism due to presumed paradoxical embolism through a PFO; or\n  * history of severe migraine headaches, despite attempted treatment with available migraine medications, for whom other specific causes of migraine headache, such as underlying disease or medications, have been ruled out; or\n  * history of severe decompression illness.\n* Negative pregnancy test in women who are of child-bearing potential\n* Signed Informed Consent form\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria for Migraine Subjects:\n\n* Onset of migraine before age of 50 years\n* History of migraine \\> 1 year\n* Migraine frequency greater than 1 migraine per month\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence of thrombus at the intended site of closure, in left atrial appendage, or documented evidence of venous thrombus in the vessels through which access to the PFO is gained.\n* Active endocarditis, or other infections producing a bacteremia\n* Presence of atrial septal defect(s) or fenestrations which allow shunting\n* Presence of implanted cardiac valves, pacemakers, cardioverters/defibrillators (ICDs) or vena cava filters.\n* Subjects with coagulation disorders or bleeding disorders including gastric ulcers, who are unable to take antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy\n* Subjects with an intra-cardiac mass, tumor, clots or vegetation\n* Large, redundant atrial septal aneurysm that would prohibit adequate device access to the PFO or closure of the PFO, in the judgment of the investigator.
