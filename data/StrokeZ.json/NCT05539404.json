Previous cohort studies results suggest that patients with an acute ischemic stroke with large core and substantial penumbra on perfusion imaging benefit from EVT while those with no salvageable ischemic tissue did not. The Investigator aim to demonstrate in a randomized controlled trials (RCT) that EVT (Endo Vascular Treatment) in addition to BMT (Best Medical Treatment) increases the rate of functional recovery (mRS 0-2) at 3 months in patients with a LVO-related AIS with a large core and substantial penumbra evolving for less than 24hrs","detailedDescription":"The reperfusion of salvageable ischemic tissue (penumbra) to improve functional recovery is the aim of the endovascular treatment (EVT) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) complicating large cerebral vessel occlusion (LVO). Downstream of an LVO, imaging profiles are highly variable ranging from a large completed infarction within 2 hrs to a small core and a large mismatch at 24 hrs after onset . A large core is typically associated with a poor prognosis and was a common exclusion criterion from the RCTs that demonstrated the efficacy of EVT for LVO related AIS . However the investigator recently reported that AIS with a large core 1- represent 20% of the LVO-related AIS scanned within 6 hours after onset 2- Up to 50% had a MM on perfusion imaging and 3- EVT increases the rate of functional recovery in patients with a large core over BMT only in the subgroup of patients with a MM (Mismatch) on baseline imaging .\n\nOne hundred and eighty patients experiencing an LVO-related AIS within 24 hours after last known well, with a documented large core (\\>70mL) and a MM on baseline imaging will be randomized (1:1) to undergo EVT+BMT vs. BMT in a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, in parallel groups with blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE design) superiority trial.\n\nStudy participants will be followed up for 6 months. Participants will be treated and managed in acute stroke units by certified stroke neurologists and neurointerventionists according to the current recommendations . Neurological deficit will be assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) by certified investigators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","large stroke","Multimodal brain imaging","Thrombectomy","endovascular treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Strategy Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"endovascular treatment in addition to best medical treatment","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular treatment in addition of best medical treatment."]},{"label":"Control Strategy Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"best medical treatment"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular treatment in addition of best medical treatment.","description":"Endovascular treatment (EVT) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) related to an anterior large cerebral vessel occlusion (LVO)","armGroupLabels":["Experimental Strategy Group"],"otherNames":["Mechanical thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of patients achieving a functional recovery defined by modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at 3 months","description":"Good functional outcome will be defined by a Modified Rankin Scale of 0-2, done by a certified rater, blinded of the arm of the randomization","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale","description":"Rate of patients with Modified Rankin Scale of 0-2 , rate of patients with Modified Rankin Scale 0-3 and Global disability assessed by overall distribution of the Modified Rankin Scale (shift analysis combining scores 5 and 6)","timeFrame":"3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"National Institute of Health Scale","description":"Rate of patients achieving an early neurological improvement National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) \\>or=8 reduction from baseline to day 1 or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) =0-1 at day 1","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score","description":"Rate of successful reperfusion in the EndoVascular Treatment+Best medical treatment arm defined by a mTICI ( Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) 2bc3 score","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"mortality rate","description":"Number of subject who die during the study participation in each arm.","timeFrame":"3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Symptomatic Hemorrhagic Transformation","description":"Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation is defined by an intra cerebral hemorrhage (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III classification \" ECASS III \") associated with a 4 or more point increase on the National Institute of Health \" NIH \" Stroke Scale by comparison with NIH Stroke Scale immediately predeterioration.","timeFrame":"36 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients experiencing an acute ischemic stroke related to an anterior proximal large vessel occlusion (ICA/M1/Tandem) on MR or CT-angiography evolving for less than 24 hours from last known to be well.
