These exercises can involve explicit or implicit motor learning. Explicit learning involves verbal knowledge of movement performance, while implicit learning involves minimal verbal knowledge and learning in a less conscious manner. The purpose of the study is to identify the efficacy and difference between implicit and explicit motor training in improving upper extremity functions in chronic stroke patients. The study will use laser pointer pattern tracking exercises and precise repositioning tasks for explicit motor training and a cognitive-motor dual-task training for implicit motor training. The laser-pointer assisted angle reproduction test, Wolf Motor Function Test and Arm Motor Ability Test will be used for evaluation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group A","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"will be treated by selected physical therapy program only for 60 minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: Selected physical therapy program"]},{"label":"Study group B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"will be treated by implicit motor training program for 30 minutes, in addition to the conventional physical therapy program for the lower extremity for 30 minutes ,total duration 60 minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: Implicit motor training program","Other: Selected physical therapy program"]},{"label":"Study group C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"will be treated by explicit motor training program for 30 minutes, in addition to the conventional physical therapy program for the lower extremity for 30 minutes, total duration 60 minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: Explicit motor training program","Other: Selected physical therapy program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Implicit motor training program","description":"The implicit motor training aims to create a learning situation in which the learner is not (or minimally) aware of the underlying rules of the practiced motor skill. Cognitive-motor dual-task training will be used, which involves practicing hand-reaching and grasping in different locations in space while performing cognitive tasks associated with attention, memory, and executive function. The cognitive tasks include naming words, counting backwards, counting tones, counting days and months backwards, listening to a number and counting backwards by twos and threes, telling daily stories, spelling words backward, continuous subtraction of 7 from 100, and the Stroop task. The training will be tailored to the participant's abilities.","armGroupLabels":["Study group B"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Explicit motor training program","description":"The explicit motor training aims to create a learning situation in which the learner is very aware of the learning process by providing detailed explicit instructions on each exercise. The Motion Guidance Shoulder Kit will be used for this intervention, which involves four exercises: \"Around the clock\" in flexion and abduction, \"Locate the Target\" in active range of motion, \"Butterfly\" in tracing small and large butterfly patterns, and \"Test your positional awareness\" in locating circles with eyes open and closed.
