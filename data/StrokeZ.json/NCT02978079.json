Dissection of the carotid artery is one of the etiologies for ischemic stroke in young patients.\n\nIn our current study, we will explore the diagnostic accuracy of automated binocular pupillometry in the diagnosis or HS, and its potential in identifying dissection of the carotid artery in patients of young age who suffer ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Horner's Syndrome","Stroke","Dissection Carotid Artery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":135,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pupillometry in stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All eligible patients will undergo pupillometry test for the finding of Horner's syndrome","interventionNames":["Device: Automated pupillometry"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Automated pupillometry","description":"Automated pupillometry will be performed in patients with acute stroke with the intention of diagnosing Horner's syndrome","armGroupLabels":["Pupillometry in stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Finding of pupillary dilation lag using pupillometry in patients with acute stroke due to carotid artery dissection","timeFrame":"1 day of initial visit"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults 60 years of age or younger\n* Acute stroke (less than 72 hours from admission)\n* Informed Consent as documented by signature (Appendix Informed Consent Form)\n* Ability to understand the study information and consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* known history of HS\n* Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems, psychological disorders, dementia, etc.\n* Medications affecting pupillary response\n* History of ocular surgery affecting the pupil","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Konrad P Weber, MD","affiliation":"Ophthalmology Department, University Hospital Zurich","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ophthalmology Department, University Hospital Zurich","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Zurich","zip":"CH-8091","country":"Switzerland","contacts":[{"name":"Konrad P Weber, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0041442555549","email":"KONRAD.WEBER@USZ.CH"},{"name":"Konrad P Weber, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.36667,"lon":8.54999}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006732","term":"Horner Syndrome"},{"id":"D000013577","term":"Syndrome"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000004194","term":"Disease"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000001342","term":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000015877","term":"Miosis"},{"id":"D000011681","term":"Pupil Disorders"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000005128","term":"Eye Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","asFound":"Syndrome","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9482","name":"Horner Syndrome","asFound":"Horner's Syndrome","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4333","name":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27669","name":"Primary Dysautonomias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18109","name":"Miosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14225","name":"Pupil Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7961","name":"Eye Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T2837","name":"Horner's Syndrome","asFound":"Horner's Syndrome","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC11","name":"Eye Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
