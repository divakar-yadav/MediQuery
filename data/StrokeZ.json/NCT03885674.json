The findings for this study may help develop evidence-based reminder protocols to reduce medication self-administration errors after brain injury.","detailedDescription":"The investigators are interested in studying how brain injury (TBI, stroke, etc.) survivors manage self-administering their medication once they return home, and are aiming to improve their medication adherence. In this six month long study, patients will be placed into one of three intervention groups 1) standard care received (usual care, no reminder provided), 2) receive a video call at time medication is to be taken, 3) receive an automated text message when medication is to be taken. The investigators aim to identify which intervention is best at helping brain injury survivors adhere to their medication schedule, with the future goal of implementing this type of reminder protocol into standard care.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that automated reminder text messages will result in MSA improvement comparable to video calls, maintained over the six month period.\n\nAllocation to groups: Patients will be randomized to receive video calls, automated text messages, or no intervention (standard care). The randomization schedule is by computer-generated number list."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Cognitive Impairment","Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Medication Adherence","Medication Compliance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be randomized to one of three intervention groups; video call reminders, automated text messages, or no intervention (standard care).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Reminder Interventions","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receive daily reminders from Kessler Foundation study personnel on when to take their medication.","interventionNames":["Other: Video Call Reminder Condition","Other: Automated Text Message Reminder Condition"]},{"label":"Standard Condition","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"This group will not receive reminders on when to take their medication from Kessler Foundation staff and will receive the usual and standard care."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Video Call Reminder Condition","description":"Receive daily video call reminders from Kessler Foundation research staff directly at the time of each medication dose and instructed to take the medication while on the video call.","armGroupLabels":["Reminder Interventions"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Automated Text Message Reminder Condition","description":"Receive daily automated text messages at the time of each medication dose and will be instructed to take the medication at that time.
