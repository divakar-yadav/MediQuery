Sessions will last 30 minutes, 3 times a week for 4 weeks.\n* TMT group: will receive mirror therapy using an acrylic mirror and perform finger, wrist, elbow exercises using their paralyzed limb. Sessions will last 30 minutes, 3 times a week for 4 weeks.\n* Control group: will receive conventional physical therapy consisting of exercises for the upper extremity, 60 minutes per day, 5 sessions a week, for 4 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Rehabilitation","Mirror Movement Therapy"],"keywords":["Stroke","Stroke Rehabilitation","Mirror Movement Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"360 Degrees Virtual Reality-based Mirror Therapy Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The group which will receive 360 Degrees Virtual Reality-based Mirror Therapy Group","interventionNames":["Procedure: 360 Degrees virtual reality-based mirror therapy","Procedure: Conventional Physical Therapy"]},{"label":"Traditional Mirror Therapy Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The group which will receive traditional mirror therapy using a conventional mirror","interventionNames":["Procedure: Traditional mirror therapy","Procedure: Conventional Physical Therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional Physical Therapy Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The group which will receive conventional rehabilitation for upper extremity","interventionNames":["Procedure: Conventional Physical Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"360 Degrees virtual reality-based mirror therapy","description":"Participants will receive mirror therapy using a virtual reality device (Pico G2 VR 4K, Pico, China).
