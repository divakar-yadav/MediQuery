This impaired acute stage BRS has been reported to be predictive of worsen outcome years after stroke in general. However, it is not very clear if the impaired acute stroke BRS would actually persist months after the acute stage. It is also not clear that such change, if any, would correlate with the functional outcome or prognosis after stroke.\n\nThe trial is to investigate the longitudinal time course of BRS after ischemic stroke up to the 6th month post stroke and to see if there is any correlation of the changes in BRS with the functional outcome parameters using NIHSS and mRS scores throughout this period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Baroreflexes","Autonomic Nervous System Diseases"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Baroreflex sensitivity","Prognosis","Cardiovascular autonomic regulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Baroreflex sensitivity can be done within 72 hours of onset of acute ischemic stroke\n* 50-80 years old\n* Must have either brain CT or brain MRI done\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* NIHSS score \\> 10\n* Patient could not cooperate\n* Unstable vital sign\n* Atrial fibrillation\n* Transient ischemic attack patient\n* Diabetic patient\n* Impaired renal function (Cr \\> 2.26 mg/dl)\n* Unstable angina, acute myocardiac infarction, cardiomyopathy patients\n* Patient who has known autonomic dysfunction","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Siupak Lee, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","email":"siupakmd@ms1.hinet.net"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Siupak Lee, M.D.","affiliation":"Far Eastern Memorial Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Far Eastern Memorial Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Panchiao City","state":"Taipei County","zip":"220","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Siupak Lee, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","email":"siupakmd@ms1.hinet.net"},{"name":"Siupak Lee, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Lung Chan, M.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Dong-feng Yeih, M.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}]}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000001342","term":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000054969","term":"Primary Dysautonomias"},{"id":"D000006967","term":"Hypersensitivity"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9708","name":"Hypersensitivity","asFound":"Sensitivity","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4333","name":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases","asFound":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M27669","name":"Primary Dysautonomias","asFound":"Autonomic Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9890","name":"Immune System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
