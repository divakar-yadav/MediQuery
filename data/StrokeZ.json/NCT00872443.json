Current survey of these patients after implantation of a prothesis in interauricular septum is defined by a consultation at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery for a clinical exam and an echocardiography. One year after implantation, the investigators systematically realized a control by MRI associated to a contrast echography.\n\nIn the aim of evaluating the investigators' medical practice, the investigators decided to do an observational study which will permit us to judge of the interest or lack of interest of our \"Good medical practice\" before the publication of prospective and randomised clinical studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Permeable Foramen Ovale","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FOP","description":"Patients who already have an occlusion of POF secondary to a cryptogenic CVA and younger than 55 years old and without characterized thromboembolic events.","interventionNames":["Other: Data collection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Data collection","description":"Collection of characteristics of interauricular septum, characteristics of the CVA, and headache history.\n\nCollection of anamnesis data, surgical past history, especially at the moment of the implement of prothesis, collection of dtat of transthoracic echography, transcranial echodoppler, holter ECG, cerebral MRI.","armGroupLabels":["FOP"]}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* less than 55 years old\n* occlusion of FOP after cryptogenic CVA\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* characterized thromboembolic event\n* patients who have a surgery after transitory ischemic accident","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patient who had an occlusion of POF after CVA, younger than 55 years and without thromboembolic events.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Nantes University Hospital","city":"Nantes","zip":"44093","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.21725,"lon":-1.55336}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
