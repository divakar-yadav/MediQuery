Stroke may occur in approximately one third of patients as a result of narrowing of the blood vessels around the brain, following aSAH.\n\nOne theory as to why this may happen is because bleeding around the base of the brain damages particular cells (neurons) that control blood flow around the rest of the brain. These neurons may control blood flow by releasing a neurotransmitter called Acetyl Choline (ACh). Our hypothesis is that damage to these neurons may prevent the production of ACh, which then causes reduced blood flow and stroke if left untreated.\n\nBy stimulating these neurons, we aim to investigate whether it is possible to improve the blood flow around brain and ultimately prevent strokes in patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage. Donepezil, a drug widely used in dementia, inhibits the brain's natural break down of ACh. We predict that by increasing the amount of Ach in these neurons, donepezil may improve blood flow to the brain, reducing the chance of developing stroke.\n\nTrial Protocol\n\nAll patients admitted to St George's hospital with a confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage between the ages of 18 and 85 years old will be invited to participate in the trial. The protocol has been designed to take place around the patients' aneurysm treatment, which is performed under general anesthesia (GA). Recruited participants will be anesthetized for their aneurysm treatment and then enter the study.\n\nAll trial participants will have a Xenon CT scan under GA to assess brain blood flow prior to having treatment of their aneurysm. Patients randomized to donepezil treatment will receive a loading dose of 20mg via a feeding tube immediately after their Xenon scan. Patients in the control group will not receive the drug.\n\nAll patients in the trial will undergo repeat Xenon perfusion scanning under GA between 3 and 4 hours after their first scan, which coincides with the completion of their aneurysm treatment. Those in the donepezil group will then receive a daily dose of 5 mg for a period of 21 days.\n\nAll aspects of care other than those related to the trial will be the same as for any other subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. Patients (or their legal representative for those unable to consent) will be able to decline participation in the trial or withdraw at any point."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Delayed Neurological Deficit","Delayed Cerebral Ischemia","Vasospasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Donepezil","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in the donepezil arm will receive the drug for 21 days as specified in the protocol in addition to current best medical treatment for aSAH patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Donepezil"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Control group participants will not receive a placebo drug but will undergo cerebral blood flow imaging in the same manner as the donepezil patients.
