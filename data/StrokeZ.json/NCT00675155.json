It is caused by the interruption of flow of blood to the brain (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of blood vessels in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function. The interruption of blood flow or the rupture of blood vessels causes brain cells (neurons) in the affected area to die. The effects of a stroke depend on where the brain was injured, as well as how much damage occurred. A stroke can impact any number of areas including your ability to move, see, remember, speak, reason and read and write.\n\nIt is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20 microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Apoplexy","Cerebral Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebrovascular Accident, Acute","Cerebrovascular Apoplexy","Cerebrovascular Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Radiation: Far Infrared Radiation (5μm to 20μm wavelength)","interventionNames":["Radiation: Far Infrared Radiation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Far Infrared Radiation","description":"Radiation: Far Infrared Radiation (5μm to 20μm wavelength) Far Infrared radiation for 30 to 40 minutes per treatment session.","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Management and Cure of Stroke","timeFrame":"2 Years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rehabilitation of the following: ability to move, see, remember, speak, reason and read and write.","timeFrame":"2 Years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* People with Stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ken Nedd, M.D.","affiliation":"GAAD Medical Research Institute Inc.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"The Centre for Incurable Diseases","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M4V 1L5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14","removedCountries":["United States"]},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
