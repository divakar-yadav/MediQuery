Patients received an intravenous infusion (i.v.) treatment within 24 hours of an ICH event and were up titrated for 7 days. Following the i.v. treatment, participants received 10 mg BAF312 or placebo in tablet form (taken daily orally) for an additional 7 days. Participants were followed for an additional 76 days after treatment for neurological and safety conditions during three clinic visits.\n\nRecruitment for the trial was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-two patients had been enrolled in the trial and completed the protocol as planned. After seven months of the trial being on hold, an Interim analysis was conducted and reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee. Novartis terminated the trial due to lack of potential efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke","Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)"],"keywords":["stroke","intracerebral hemorrhage","ICH","BAF312","siponimod","sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor","adult"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of BAF312 on top of standard-of-care for ICH, consisting of 3 epochs: Screening/Baseline, Treatment (Day 1-14), and Follow-Up (to Day 90)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BAF312","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Days 1 - 7, IV up titration; days 8 - 14, 10 mg (5 x 2 mg tablets) taken daily orally","interventionNames":["Drug: BAF312 solution","Drug: BAF312 tablet"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Days 1 - 7, IV up titration; days 8 - 14, 10 mg (5 x 2 mg tablets) taken daily orally - matching placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Matching Placebo for BAF312 solution","Drug: Matching Placebo for BAF312 tablet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"BAF312 solution","description":"Solution for intravenous (IV) infusion - 4.5mg/4.5mL","armGroupLabels":["BAF312"],"otherNames":["Siponimod"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Matching Placebo for BAF312 solution","description":"Solution for intravenous (IV) infusion - 0mg/4.5mL matching placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"BAF312 tablet","description":"2 mg film-coated tablet","armGroupLabels":["BAF312"],"otherNames":["Siponimod"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Matching Placebo for BAF312 tablet","description":"0 mg film-coated tablet matching placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Absolute Perihematoma Edema (aPHE) Volume Measured by Computed Tomography (CT) Scan After Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)","description":"Following the initial diagnostic CT, repeat CT images were obtained between 24-48 h after the diagnostic scan, and on Day 7 and Day 14 to capture the trajectory of PHE increase and plateau after ICH.

Male or female patients aged 18 to 85 years (inclusive).\n2. Written informed consent obtained before any study assessment is performed. If the patient is not able to give the informed consent personally, consent by a relative or legal representative is acceptable.\n3. Spontaneous, supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage in cerebral cortex or deep brain structures (putamen, thalamus, caudate, and associated deep white matter tracts) with a volume ≥ 10 mL but ≤ 60 mL (calculated by the ABC/2 method, after Kothari et al 1996) determined by routine clinical MRI or CT.\n4. Patients with the onset of ICH witnessed and/or last seen healthy no longer than 24 hrs previously.\n5. Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) best motor score no less than 5 (brings hands above clavicle on stimulus to head or neck).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nICH patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this study:\n\n1. Use of other investigational drugs within 5 half-lives of enrollment, or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline (for biologics), whichever is longer.\n2.

Current use of concomitant medications with potent CYP2C9/3A4 inhibitory or induction potential.\n4. Infratentorial (midbrain, pons, medulla, or cerebellum) ICH.\n5. Candidates for surgical hematoma evacuation or other urgent surgical intervention (i.e., surgical relief of increased intracranial pressure) on initial presentation. If during the treatment period surgical hematoma evacuation or surgical intervention to lower intracranial pressure becomes indicated, the investigational treatment should be stopped.\n6. Patients with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) having a Graeb score of \\>3 on initial presentation. Patients must not have blood in the 4th ventricle and may only have blood in the 3rd ventricle in the absence of ventricular expansion.
