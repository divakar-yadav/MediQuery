Due to stress ulcer and gastric reflux in acute stage, patients with severe ischemic stroke are always complicated with stomach bleeding and pulmonary infections, resulting in poor prognosis and even death. Reducing stomach acidity and avoiding gastric reflux play a pivotal role on controlling serious complications after austere ischemic attack. Gastrointestinal decompression is an cheap, safe, effective and acknowledgemented strategy for treating stomach bleeding and preventing gastric reflux in clinical settings. Early gastrointestinal decompression seems to be an available method to reduce stomach acidity and avoid gastric reflux after severe ischemic stroke. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early gastrointestinal decompression in patients with acute severe ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stomach Acidity","Pulmonary Infection","Gastrointestinal Decompression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gastrointestinal decompression group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: Gastrointestinal decompression"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Procedure: Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Gastrointestinal decompression","description":"Gastric tube is inserted within 24-hour severe ischemic stroke attack; gastrointestinal decompression is performed for 48 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Gastrointestinal decompression group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Control","description":"Gastric tube is inserted within 24-hour severe ischemic stroke attack.","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"90-day Death","description":"Death rate at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"90-day mRS","description":"mRS at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"90-day Barthel scores","description":"Barthel scores at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"30-day mRS","description":"mRS at 30 days","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"30-day Barthel scores","description":"Barthel scores at 30 days","timeFrame":"30 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18-80 years\n* severe AIS, including NIHSS score\\>20 in dominant hemisphere infarction, or NIHSS score\\>15 in non-dominant hemisphere infarction, or NIHSS consciousness score \\>1; · massive infarction, characterized by infarction area larger than 1/3 of the effected middle cerebral artery territory and/or the cerebellum territory presented in admitted computed tomography (CT) or MRI\n* onset-to-needle time within 24 hours\n* prestroke modified Ranking scales (mRS)≤1\n* sign the informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Recent respiratory infection and/or gastrointestinal bleeding\n* austere diseases such as tumors and dyscrasia\n* intention to undergo emergency thrombectomy\n* pregnant women or nursing mother\n* contraindication for gastric tubes\n* participating in other clinical trials within previous 3 months.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jiayue Ding","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+8618518347837","email":"sjnkzz2@163.com"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9973","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6058","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9134","name":"Heartburn","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
