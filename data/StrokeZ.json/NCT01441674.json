The investigators will also be collecting data regarding a child's heart rate and blood pressure prior to the session starting and ending to determine if having a therapy dog present also helps relax a child.","detailedDescription":"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a patient in the pediatric acute care setting receiving Occupational Therapy (OT) services in adjunct with animal assisted therapy (AAT) are more motivated to actively participate in the therapy session for a longer period of time.\n\nMethods:\n\nThirty inpatients will be recruited to participate in this study. This study will utilize a randomized crossover study design where the patients act as their own control. The treatment period for hospitalized patients will include an on off pattern of incorporating AAT into their OT session. Patients' participation of therapy will be assessed with a participation scale (see Figure 2) and the OT session time. Patients will be evaluated for OT and the therapist will determine goals based on functional status and needs of the particular patient. Goals will be determined by providing a functional evaluation based upon Occupational Therapists clinical observation, developmental standards and current functional level of the patient.\n\nPatients who are potential candidates for this study will be hospitalized at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota on the St. Paul campus. All inpatients stated to have decreased functional skills that have been referred by a physician to OT will be invited to participate this study.\n\nPatients have a difficult time participating in various therapies due to emotional stress, anxiety, and feeling uncomfortable with the hospital environment. Limited studies have demonstrated the value of AAT used in conjunction with OT for children, regardless of diagnosis within the hospital setting. Results of this study can justify the use of this valuable therapy not only for the selected population, but also for other disciplines such as physical and speech therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Developmental Delays","Global Developmental Delay","Stroke","Cancers","Seizures Disorders","Behavior Problems","Feeding Disorder","Developmental Delay in Feeding"],"keywords":["Occupational Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Animal Assisted Therapy Visit 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard OT Therapy with Animal Assisted Therapy at Visit 1 and Not at Visit 2","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Animal Assisted Therapy"]},{"label":"Animal Assisted Therapy at Visit 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard OT Therapy with Animal Assisted Therapy at Visit 2 and not Visit 1","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Animal Assisted Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Animal Assisted Therapy","description":"There will be a therapy dog and dog trainer present working with the patient for the AAT arm.","armGroupLabels":["Animal Assisted Therapy Visit 1","Animal Assisted Therapy at Visit 2"],"otherNames":["Group 1 and Group 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"OT Participation scale","description":"The patients response to therapy can be measures using the following behavior domains (cognition, fine motor, activities and daily living, feeding skills, active range of motion/activities, and functional Transfers).","timeFrame":"4 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Vital Signs (Blood Pressure and heart rate)","description":"Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured to assess if AAT minimizes stress and anxiety.","timeFrame":"4 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inpatient Occupational Therapy Referrals\n* Ages 0-21 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are uncomfortable with dogs\n* Patients who exhibits violent behavior\n* Animal Allergies\n* Patients are unable to work with a dog\n* Patients who exhibit severe cognitive delays","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nicole Iammatteo, OT","affiliation":"Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Children's Hopsitals and Clinics of Minnesota","city":"St. Paul","state":"Minnesota","zip":"55102","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":44.94441,"lon":-93.09327}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000012640","term":"Seizures"},{"id":"D000004827","term":"Epilepsy"},{"id":"D000066553","term":"Problem Behavior"},{"id":"D000001068","term":"Feeding and Eating Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000001526","term":"Behavioral Symptoms"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7673","name":"Epilepsy","asFound":"Seizure Disorder","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M85","name":"Problem Behavior","asFound":"Behavior Problem","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15142","name":"Seizures","asFound":"Seizures","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4070","name":"Feeding and Eating Disorders","asFound":"Feeding Disorder","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4508","name":"Behavioral Symptoms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
