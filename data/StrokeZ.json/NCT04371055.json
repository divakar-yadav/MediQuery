This risk of stroke is increased by atrial fibrillation, which often \"comes and goes\" (called paroxysmal) and hence escapes routine diagnostics. The hypothesis of Find-AF 2 is that enhanced (evaluation in a ECG core lab), prolonged (at least 7 days of rhythm monitoring annually) and intensified (continuous rhythm monitoring in high risk patients) not only finds atrial fibrillation more often, but that changes in therapeutic management (e. g. start of anticoagulation after detection of atrial fibrillation) results in a decrease of cardioembolism (which can be either recurrent stroke or systemic embolism).\n\nTo prove this hypothesis, patients will be randomised into two groups: the first group will receive the currently available standard care for patients with stroke. In the second group, cardiac rhythm monitoring adapted to the risk of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation is performed - either with a 7-day long-term ECG (at baseline, after 3 and 12 months and every 12 months thereafter) or with continuous monitoring using an implantable cardiac monitor. If atrial fibrillation is detected, this information will be given to the treating study physician. Any therapeutic decision is at the discretion of the treating physician, but should follow current guidelines.","detailedDescription":"The Find AF 2 study will investigate whether intensified rhythm monitoring in patients with recent ischemic stroke leads to a decrease in recurrent thromboembolism (defined as recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism). This will be achieved by identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and subsequently switching secondary prevention therapy from antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation. The intensity of heart rhythm monitoring will be risk-adjusted: Patients with an estimated low risk of atrial fibrillation receive a 7-day Holter ECG, which is repeated after 3 and 12 months and annually thereafter. Patients with a high risk of atrial fibrillation (defined by increased supraventricular ectopic activity) receive continuous ECG monitoring using an implanted loop recorder. The control arm is treated according to local standards, which includes cardiac rhythm monitoring for at least 24 hours according to current guidelines. Prior to randomization, a 24-hour Holter ECG is performed in both study arms, ensuring minimal ECG monitoring for patients in the control arm and allowing risk stratification in the intervention arm. Additional ECG monitoring using stroke telemetry and/or additional Holter ECGs is possible according to local standards, provided it does not exceed 7 days. Patients in both study arms will be followed up for at least 24 months.\n\nIt should be noted that this study only provides diagnostic information, the therapeutic decision is left to the treating physician."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Ischemic Stroke","ECG Monitoring","Secondary Prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised, parallel, multicenter interventional trial with blinded assessment of the primary endpoint","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Risk-adapted ECG monitoring for atrial fibrillation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention Group with high Risk for AF:\n\nContinuous Rhythm Monitoring using an implantable cardiac Monitor\n\nIntervention group with low risk for AF:\n\n7-day Holter ECG at baseline, after 3 and 12 months and then annually until the end of the study or the first occurrence of atrial Fibrillation","interventionNames":["Other: 7-day Holter ECG","Other: Implantable cardiac monitor"]},{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"OTHER","description":"Standard of care rhythm monitoring","interventionNames":["Other: Standard of care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"7-day Holter ECG","description":"7-day Holter ECG at baseline and after 3 and 12 months and then annually until the end of the study or the first (in patients with low risk of atrial fibrillation)","armGroupLabels":["Risk-adapted ECG monitoring for atrial fibrillation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Implantable cardiac monitor","description":"Continuous rhythm monitoring using an implantable cardiac monitor","armGroupLabels":["Risk-adapted ECG monitoring for atrial fibrillation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard of care","description":"Usual care according to current guidelines (in patients with low and high risk of atrial fibrillation)","armGroupLabels":["Standard of Care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary efficacy endpoint: Time until recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism","description":"The trial will be event driven.
