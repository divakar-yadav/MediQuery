Chalmers, Johnson, Tang and Titler developed the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) after modifying the Simple Oral Health Status Measurement Scale in 2004. This scale can be extended to assess the oral health of elderly people with daily living function dependence, and can be assisted by clinical nursing staff after guidance. The contents of the questionnaire were divided into eight items, including lips, tongue, gums, toothache, saliva, teeth, dentures and oral hygiene. The degree of oral health was divided by 0, 1 and 2 points for each item. The total score ranged from 0 to 16, the higher the score was, the worse the oral health was.","timeFrame":"to evaluate the seventh day after use green tea gargle"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The participants assess the patient's degree of halitosis by the portable breath meter.","description":"In this study, a portable breath meter (HC-150®, Tanita Co, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the concentration of volatile sulfide in the mouth of patients with a score ranging from 0 to 5. The higher the score, the more severe the halitosis. Manner to ensure that the portable measuring instrument measured the stability of the data, before the study, to perform 20 minutes five patients repeated measurement mouth sulfide values, the research process are made by same nurses within non-executive care plan for all the object of study manner using a portable measuring instrument for testing, in order to maintain consistency measurement.

In 1970, Turesky et al. improved the method. After staining with plaque stains, they scored according to the stained area. The scoring criteria were as follows: 0 was for plaque free; 1. There are scattered punctate dental plaque at the gingival margin of the tooth neck; 2: the width of dental plaque in the neck is less than 1mm(continuous); 3: dental plaque covering area of the tooth neck is more than 1mm, less than 1/3 of the tooth face; 4: the area covered by dental plaque is between 1/3 and 2/3 of the teeth; 5. The dental plaque covers more than 2/3 of the teeth. To distinguish the degree of dental plaque, the total score is 2 points. When the index is greater than 2, it is high; when the index is between 0 and 1, it is low.
