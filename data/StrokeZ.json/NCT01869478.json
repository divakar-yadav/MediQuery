A randomized trial is justified for the following reasons: 1) The high rate of death and disability associated with ischemic stroke despite treatment with intravenous rt-PA mandates critical analysis of alternate therapies with therapeutic potential, 2) endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke is expanding in North America without compelling evidence of safety and efficacy from well-designed clinical trials, 3) critical cost-effectiveness analysis cannot be done without acquiring pertinent outcomes data from controlled studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intravenous Thrombolysis","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"0.9mg/kg intravenous rt-PA (max dose 90mg) - 10% administered as a bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes.","interventionNames":["Drug: Intravenous Thrombolysis"]},{"label":"Endovascular Arterial Reperfusion","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Therapeutic options will include mechanical thrombectomy/clot disruption (Penumbra aspiration system, Solitaire device, and/or Reflex catheter) and/or intracranial stent deployment.","interventionNames":["Device: Endovascular Arterial Reperfusion"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intravenous Thrombolysis","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous Thrombolysis"],"otherNames":["Altelplase, rtPA"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Endovascular Arterial Reperfusion","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular Arterial Reperfusion"],"otherNames":["Penumbra, Solitaire"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recanalization Rate of Primary Intracranial Occlusion","description":"The degree of recanalization (none, partial, complete) will be assessed in a blinded fashion on the 24-hour computed tomographic angiogram (CTA).","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Score on Modified Rankin Scale at 90 Days","description":"Functional outcome at 90-days will be assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
