All patients participated for 2 months in the study. Group 1 received true tDCS in the first month followed by SHAM stimulation in the second month. Group 2 received SHAM in the first month and true stimulation in the following month. Four stimulations of 20minutes were provided during 4 weeks before before changing stimulation intensity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","TDCS","Gait","Balance","loss of postural balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SHAM TDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Application of Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS)"]},{"label":"True TDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Direct current stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Application of Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS)","description":"Application of TDCS for 20 minutes, 4 times a week for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["SHAM TDCS"],"otherNames":["tDCS device: CESta, Mind Alive Inc.,Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Direct current stimulation","description":"Application of true TDCS for 20min, 4 times a week for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["True TDCS"],"otherNames":["tDCS device: CESta, Mind Alive Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Trunk Impairment Scale (reporting a change on trunk performance at baseline, after 1 month and after two months)","description":"The static sitting balance subscale assesses whether a subject can sit independently and remain seated when the legs are either passively or actively crossed. The dynamic sitting balance subscale evaluates the ability to actively shorten each side of the trunk, first initiated from the shoulder and subsequently initiated from the pelvic girdle. Trunk coordination is evaluated by the possibility to independently rotate the upper and lower part of the trunk. The scoring range for the static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination subscales are 7, 10 and 6 points respectively.","timeFrame":"baseline, after 1 month, After 2 months"},{"measure":"Rivermead Motor Assessment Battery (RMAB) (reporting a change on motricity of gross function, arm, leg and trunk at baseline, after 1 month and after two months)","description":"The RMAB assesses the motor performance of patients with stroke.32 It consists of test items clustered in three sections that are ordered hierarchically.
