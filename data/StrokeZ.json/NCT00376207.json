It is known that physical exercise increases insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. Wether stroke patients can increase insulin sensitivity via physical exercise is not known.\n\nChronic low-grade inflammation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Physical exercise has shown to increase IL-6 directly after exercise in untrained subjects. When fitness is increased in each subject then the peak IL-6 concentration after exercise decreases and so does the basal level of IL-6. It is not known whether stroke patients can increase physical activity level to a degree where chronic inflammation are decreased.\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate if physical exercise after stroke will increases insulin sensitivity and reduce low-grade chronic inflammation.\n\nStroke patients have been randomized to intervention with physical exercise or control in the ExStroke pilot trial and followed for 2 years. Using the study population from the ExStroke pilot trail blood samples will be obtained at the last control. Insulin sensitivity can be measured from fasting glucose and insulin using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Interleukin-6, TNF-alfa and CRP is measured to estimate chronic inflammation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Cerebral infarct","physical exercise","insulin sensitivity","low grade chronic inflammation","intervention","HOMA","PASE"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Physical exercise"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Association between PASE and HOMA"},{"measure":"Association between PASE and IL-6"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"IL-6 concentration is lower in the intervention group than control group."},{"measure":"TNF-alfa and IL-6 is positively associated."},{"measure":"IL-18 is associated to HOMA"},{"measure":"Correlation between PASE and HOMA in the intervention group vs. controls"},{"measure":"HOMA mean value in the 2 groups"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* participated in the ExStroke Pilot trail\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diabetes Mellitus\n* Not able to give informed consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Lars-Henrik Krarup, MD","affiliation":"Bispebjerg Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Bispebjerg Hospital","city":"Copenhagen","zip":"2400","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":55.67594,"lon":12.56553}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9708","name":"Hypersensitivity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9983","name":"Inflammation","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M10055","name":"Insulin","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M173072","name":"Insulin, Globin Zinc","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Hypo","name":"Hypoglycemic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
