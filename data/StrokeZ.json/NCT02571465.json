A positive response is defined as an increase in SV\\>15 %.\n\nPrediction of fluid responsiveness will be tested by AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic - ROC - curve)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodynamics","Patient Monitoring"],"keywords":["functional hemodynamic parameter","passive leg raising","stroke volume variation","pulse pressure variation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Passive leg raising test and fluid challenge"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke volume increase > 15%","description":"Stroke volume increase defines fluid responsiveness","timeFrame":"20 min"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* preserved left ventricular function\n* regular heart rhythm\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* emergency procedures\n* intra- and extra-cardial shunts\n* aortic and tricuspid valve insufficiencies\n* peripheral arterial occlusive disease","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients undergoing elective off-pump CABG","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Christoph K Hofer, MD DEAA","affiliation":"Triemli City Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Triemli City Hospital","city":"Zurich","zip":"8063","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.36667,"lon":8.54999}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19602972","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Marik PE, Cavallazzi R, Vasu T, Hirani A.
