Subjects will have had an ischemic stroke within 96 hours of enrollment. The study intervention will be a one hour monitoring session. There will be a 15 minute baseline measurement period, followed by intravenous administration of 500cc of 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes, and finally 15 minutes of monitoring post-bolus. All study measurements will cease after 1 hour. Subjects will be followed during their hospitalization for 7 days or until discharge, whichever is sooner, to monitor for adverse events and to collect clinical information."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normal Saline","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"intravenous administration of 500cc of 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Normal saline"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Normal saline","description":"intravenous administration of 500cc of 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Normal Saline"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Percentage of Change in Optical Cerebral Blood Flow (oCBF) During Bolus Normal Saline Compared to Baseline, as Measured by Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS).","description":"Ipsilesional hemisphere","timeFrame":"30 minutes after completion of saline bolus"},{"measure":"The Percentage of Change in Optical Cerebral Blood Flow (oCBF) During Bolus Normal Saline Compared to Baseline, as Measured by Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS).","description":"contralesional hemisphere","timeFrame":"30 minutes after completion of saline bolus"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age â‰¥ 18 years\n* Acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery territory on either side of the brain\n* Study intervention can be initiated within 96 hours of symptom onset\n* Willingness and ability to sign informed consent by patient or legally acceptable surrogate decision-maker\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Infarct limited to the brainstem and/or cerebellum with no involvement of the cerebral hemispheres\n* Bi-hemispheric infarction or acute infarct in the contra-lateral hemisphere within the past 30 days\n* Symptoms of active congestive heart failure (dyspnea, orthopnea, increased oxygen requirement)\n* Exacerbation of congestive heart failure, requiring hospitalization, within the past 30 days or severe systolic dysfunction with a known ejection fraction \\<20%\n* End stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis or a creatinine clearance \\<20 ml/min/1.73 m2\n* Hemicraniectomy or other skull defect that would interfere with monitoring\n* Pregnant women are excluded.
