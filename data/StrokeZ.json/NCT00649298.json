As well as improved quality of life, improved functioning and beneficial changes in a variety of laboratory parameters, it has been suggested that extended dialysis sessions might reduce mortality and major morbidity. Uncontrolled data from centres that have been providing extended dialysis shows dramatically lower mortality rates compared to those observed in centres providing standard duration dialysis. Recent analyses of extended dialysis conclude that the savings achieved in drug and hospitalization costs may lead to an overall reduction in costs compared with traditional forms of dialysis.\n\nIn this trial, we propose to examine the effects of extended dialysis (24 hours weekly or more) compared to standard dialysis (18 hours or less weekly) in patients with ESKD. The proposed study is a multi-centre, open label, randomised, controlled trial.\n\nThe study began with a pilot phase which was converted to the current main study on the receipt of peer-reviewed funding for the full study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Renal Replacement Therapy","Renal Dialysis","End Stage Kidney Disease","End Stage Renal Disease","Uremia"],"keywords":["Randomized Controlled Trial","Clinical Trial","Controlled Clinical Trial","Clinical Trial, Phase IV","Multicenter Study","End Stage Kidney Disease","Hemodialysis","Renal Dialysis","Renal Replacement Therapy","Nocturnal Dialysis","Extended dialysis","Quality of Life","Quality Adjusted Life Year","Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular","Blood Pressure","Hypertension","Anemia","Hematinics","Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents","Cost-utility Analysis","Economic Evaluation","Health Care Utilisation","Health Care Costs","Health Expenditures","Hospitalization","Cost Analysis","Cardiovascular Diseases","Acute Coronary Syndrome","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Mortality","Arteriovenous Fistula","Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical","Thrombosis","Infection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"extended hours","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"24 or more hours per week of hemodialysis","interventionNames":["Procedure: haemodialysis"]},{"label":"standard hours","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"18 or less hours per week of hemodialysis","interventionNames":["Procedure: haemodialysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"haemodialysis","description":"Comparison of different weekly duration of haemodialysis treatment","armGroupLabels":["extended hours","standard hours"],"otherNames":["Dialysis","Renal replacement therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary end-point for this study is the difference in the change in quality of life between the two groups from randomisation to the 12 month follow-up as measured by the EQ-5D instrument.","timeFrame":"12 months from randomisation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survival and cardiovascular analyses","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Quality of life and patient acceptability","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Safety outcomes","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Costs associated with each intervention","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Changes in biochemical and haematological parameters","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
