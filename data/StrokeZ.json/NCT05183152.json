One major modality for BCI control is based on motor imagery (MI), which is the mental rehearsal of the kinesthetics of a movement without actually performing it. MI-based BCIs translate motor intents into control commands for external devices. A major challenge in such BCIs is differentiating MI patterns corresponding to fine hand movements of the same limb from non-invasive EEG recordings with low spatial resolution since the cortical sources responsible for these movements are overlapping. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied contingent to the voluntary activation of the primary motor cortex through MI can help differentiate patterns of activity associated with different hand movements of the same limb by consistently recruiting the separate neural pathways associated with each of the movements within a closed-loop BCI setup. This is expected to be associated with neuroplastic changes at the cortical or corticospinal levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Motor Disorders","Healthy","Spinal Cord Injuries","Muscular Diseases","Motor Neuron Disease","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Movement Disorders"],"keywords":["motor deficits","able-bodied, healthy","unilateral and bilateral stroke","spinal cord injury","motor neuron diseases","muscular diseases (i.e. myopathy)","traumatic or neurological pain","movement disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NMES-BCI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sensory-threshold electrical stimulation is delivered to the flexors/extensors of the forearm contingent to the voluntary activation of the motor cortex by motor imagery of hand flexion/extension as detected by a closed-loop BCI.","interventionNames":["Device: NMES-BCI"]},{"label":"Visual-BCI","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Bar-based visual feedback is provided on a screen contingent to the voluntary activation of the motor cortex by motor imagery of hand flexion/extension as detected by a closed-loop BCI.","interventionNames":["Device: Visual-BCI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NMES-BCI","description":"Electroenceauphalography (EEG) signals will be recorded from subjects as they perform cued tasks for flexing/extending their non-dominant hand.
