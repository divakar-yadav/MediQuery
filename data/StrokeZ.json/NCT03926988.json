Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke, and subject belongs to one of the following subgroups:\n\n   1.1. Subject has failed IV t-PA therapy\n\n   1.2. Subject is contraindicated for IV t-PA administration\n2. Age ≥18\n3. NIHSS score ≥ 6\n4. Pre-stroke mRS score of ≤ 1\n5. Intracranial arterial occlusion of the distal intracranial carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1/M2), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), basilar artery, or vertebral artery demonstrated with DSA.\n6. Thrombectomy procedure can be initiated within 24 hours from symptom onset (defined as time last known well \\[TLKW\\])\n7. Imaging Inclusion Criteria:\n\n   7.1. Non-Contrast CT Selection (if CT Perfusion or MRI not utilized): ASPECTS 6-10 if treatment started 0-6 hours from TLKW ASPECTS 8-10 if treatment started 6-24 hours from TLKW\n\n   7.2. CT Perfusion core ≤50 cc\n\n   7.3. MRI DWI core ≤50 cc\n8. Subject or legal representative is able and willing to give informed consent within 48 hours after the intervention.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pre-existing medical neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological or functional evaluations, e.g. dementia with prescribed anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g. Aricept).\n2. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, significant cardiac arrhythmia, evidence of ongoing myocardial infarction, concern for pre- treatment pulmonary aspiration.\n3. Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or stroke in multiple territories\n4. Cerebral vasculitis\n5. History of severe allergy to contrast medium.\n6. Known allergy to NeVa materials (nitinol, stainless steel)\n7. Suspicion of aortic dissection, septic embolus, or bacterial endocarditis\n8. Systemic infection\n9. Significant mass effect with midline shift\n10. Evidence of intracranial tumor (except small meningioma)\n11. Inability to deploy NeVA device for at least one pass for any other reason\n12. Life expectancy less than 6 months\n13. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes an endovascular procedure or poses a significant hazard to the subject if an endovascular procedure was performed.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Antoine Cuijpers","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+31 6 51 55 99 37","email":"acuijpers@vesalio.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Vall d'Hebron","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Barcelona","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Marc Ribo, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"932746000","phoneExt":"6326","email":"marccriboj@hotmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Acute Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
