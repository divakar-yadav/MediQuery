With a stroke incidence more than twice that of the general U.S. population, stroke in AI's is a public health problem of staggering scope. AI's also have disproportionate burdens of many risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. However, no rigorous, population-based studies of stroke prevention have included AI's. The investigators at WSU, and community partners, have designed the \"Family Intervention in the Spirit of Motivational Interviewing\" (FITSMI), a program delivered at the household level to encourage lifestyle changes that transform the home environment and reduce stroke risk for all residents. FITSMI uses a \"talking circle\" format in which facilitators guide participants to identify goals for change and create a tailored plan for sustainable implementation that may target smoking, exercise, diet, or medication adherence. FITSMI requires just 2 sessions (baseline and 1 month post-baseline), with text messaging used to boost long-term adherence. In a group-randomized trial design, the investigators will recruit 360 households where Strong Heart Family Study members aged 45 and older reside. The investigators will assign half to FITSMI and half to a control condition that receives educational brochures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cardiovascular Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Clinical Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":458,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Brochure Arm","type":"OTHER","description":"Control Arm households receive a culturally tailored Stroke and CVD brochure for prevention.","interventionNames":["Other: Control Brochure Arm"]},{"label":"Motivational Interviewing Intervention Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The MI intervention households receive three aspects of the intervention: digital stories, motivational interviewing talking circle and the option to receive text messages to adhere to the action plan.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motivational Interviewing Intervention Arm"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motivational Interviewing Intervention Arm","armGroupLabels":["Motivational Interviewing Intervention Arm"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control Brochure Arm","armGroupLabels":["Control Brochure Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Risk Classification","description":"Investigators will use the Stroke Risk Scorecard, developed by the National Stroke Association to classify the stroke risk of participants.
