Therefore, the investigators are proposing to study the effects of protein supplementation in this group of babies. The investigators will recruit 24 infants with brain injury (evidence of hemorrhage, white matter injury, or gray matter injury) admitted to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) into the study. Upon diagnosis, the investigators will obtain consent from the parents for participation in the study, then randomly assign the baby to one of two groups - an increased protein group and a control group. Both groups of infants will be monitored to ensure no adverse effects occur due to the supplementation.\n\nProtein supplementation will continue for the first 12 months of age. Growth parameters, such as weight, length, and head circumference, will be measured while the infant is the NICU. Head circumference will be measured in the investigators outpatient clinic at three, six, and 12 months of age. At 18-22 months, the infants will be tested for neurodevelopmental outcomes using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The investigators hypothesize that infants who receive the additional protein will demonstrate increased head growth and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Perinatal Stroke","Hypoxic-ischemic Encephalopathy","White Matter Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Increased protein","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Full term infants will be on 4 g/kg/day of protein.
