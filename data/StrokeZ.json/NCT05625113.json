The main objective is to describe the overall therapeutic compliance represented by the number of uses of the neuroprosthesis in real-life situations.","detailedDescription":"Nearly 80% of stroke survivors are affected by a grip deficit. Studies had shown the potential interest of functional supplementation by functional electrical stimulation of the fingers' extensor muscles to restore gripping capacities. The limit of some studies is that they assess gripping abilities in a hospital environment, which is a non-ecological situation very different from the daily life situations. The interest of this type of device will only be established if it restores gripping capacities in the daily life of the subjects in order to allow them to improve their level of autonomy and their quality of life. The objective of the study will be to test the feasibility and usability of a wearable version of a gripping neuroprosthesis in daily life situations. The subjects will use the neuroprosthesis for 2 months at home with evaluations at the beginning and at the end of the protocol associated with a weekly follow-up in order to evaluate the modalities of use and the functional benefits linked to its use."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"One arm with participants who are not blinded.
