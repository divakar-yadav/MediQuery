Mobility is based on successful postural control and about 30% of individuals with stroke are unable to ambulate without assistance.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a new promising tool for motor recovery in neurological disease.This can be addressed through a tDCS intervention.\n\nObjective:The objectives of this study is to examine the efficacy of anodal tDCS combined with Biodex balance training on postural control in chronic stroke patients using laboratory and clinical assessments. The following essential treatment components; a) active tDCS stimulation paired with Biodex balance training, b)sham tDCS paired with Biodex balance training program.\n\nTo identify combinations effects of tDCS stimulation plus balance training . Hypothesis: Anodal tDCS targeting leg motor area (CZ) for 5-days plus Biodex balance training, will significantly improve stroke clients' balance and functional mobility.\n\nDouble blinded sham -controlled randomized tDCS stimulation Arms Assigned Interventions\n\nExperimental: Arm 1\n\ntDCS brain stimulation and simultaneous balance training\n\nParticipants underwent Active tDCS brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days.\n\nNo Intervention: Arm 2 Sham tDCS brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training","detailedDescription":"Participants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days, All outcome measures will be measured in 4 time points: pre-test, post-test after 10 sessions of intervention, and after 1 week and 1 months post intervention as follow ups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["tDCS, stroke, postural control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial direct current stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"ARM1: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention and simultaneous balance training.\n\nParticipants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days,for 1 week.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"ARM 2","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"ARM2: Sham tDCS and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days,for 1 week.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","description":"Participants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days,for 1 week.","armGroupLabels":["Transcranial direct current stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham","description":"During sham stimulation, the current ramped up for 30 seconds, ramped back down for 30 seconds, and then remained off for the duration of the stimulation then and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days,for 1 week.","armGroupLabels":["ARM 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postural control","description":"Functional dynamic balance","timeFrame":"After 5 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Static Balance","description":"linear analysis","timeFrame":"After 5 days"},{"measure":"Change of Static Balance","description":"linear analysis","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Change of Static Balance","description":"linear analysis","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postural sway flactuation","description":"nonlinear (Approximate entropy) analysis","timeFrame":"After 5 days"},{"measure":"Postural sway flactuation","description":"nonlinear (Approximate entropy) analysis","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Postural sway flactuation","description":"nonlinear (Approximate entropy) analysis","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Change of Postural control","description":"Functional dynamic balance","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Change of Postural control","description":"Functional dynamic balance","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nage â‰¥18 years;
