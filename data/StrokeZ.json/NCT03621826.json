In the United States, TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound) is a proven method of screening children with SCA for stroke. However, many children are not getting the screening they need. This study will examine the issues that hinder and help children get the screening at 28 different hospitals and sickle cell centers to improve care for all children with sickle cell anemia. The investigators will then plan a study (part 3) aimed to improve stroke screening and prevention in sickle cell anemia.","detailedDescription":"DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention: Looking At the Care Environment) is a multi-center, national NHLBI-funded grant to evaluate the real world implementation of the STOP protocol in which transcranial Doppler (TCD), a measure of cerebral blood vessel velocity, is used to screen for stroke risk in children ages 2-16 with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Based on the STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia) protocol, children identified as high risk of stroke by TCD are initiated on chronic red cell transfusion therapy (CRCT) for stroke prevention. Children with normal TCD are screened annually from the age of 2 until they are 16 years of age.\n\nThis will be a THREE-part study beginning with Part 1 - a retrospective case record review followed by Part 2 - a multi-level qualitative assessment of barriers and enablers to TCD screening and initiation of chronic red blood cell transfusions and later adding Part 3 - a multi-center implementation clinical trial.The investigators will compare two implementation interventions to improve TCD screening.\n\nThere are three aims of the grant and each aim is equivalent to the respective parts of the grant (i.e. Part 1 covers 1 aim). There are a total 28 consortium sites. The Medical University of South Carolina is the lead institution for this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Ischemic","Sickle Cell Disease"],"keywords":["sickle cell anemia","TCD","screening","dissemination","implementation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5247,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Children with Sickle Cell Anemia","description":"Data from patients with sickle cell anemia will be entered into a retrospective database for evaluation of implementation rates of TCD (stroke) screening).
