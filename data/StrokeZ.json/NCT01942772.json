Here a novel powered ankle foot orthoses which can provide ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion assistant using electric motor is proposed in this paper. The mechanical structure of the orthoses includes wearing parts, ankle joint hinged part, driving unit, transmission mechanism and sensing units. This study provides a new method for ankle foot orthoses design and has great significance for ankle rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ankle Injuries"],"keywords":["powered ankle-foot orthosis","mechanical structure","optimization","dorsiflexion","plantar flexion","gait","servomotor","ankle rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental test of healthy subjects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"wearing experiment，motion experiment","interventionNames":["Device: Ankle-Foot Orthosis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Ankle-Foot Orthosis","armGroupLabels":["experimental test of healthy subjects"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"good performance of the ankle foot orthosis","description":"Two researchers wore the ankle foot orthosis without any motion to test the rationality of design size and wearing coordination；motion experiment without load was carried out to test the stability of transmission structure and effectiveness of motor control.
