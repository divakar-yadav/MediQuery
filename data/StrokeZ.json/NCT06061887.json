The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* what is the frequency of recurrent falls\n* which factors are associated with recurrent falls in patients with acute stroke.\n\nParticipants will be evaluated in terms of\n\n* frequency of recurrent falls within the six months after stroke\n* fear of falling\n* the stroke severity (Canadian Neurological Scale),\n* ambulation level (Functional Ambulation Classification),\n* functional disability (Functional Independence Scale)\n* Postural control and balance\n* functional status (Modified Rankin Scale)","detailedDescription":"Falling is common in stroke patients both in the hospital and at home after discharge. As a result, physical problems such as fractures and psychological problems such as fear of falling, limitation of physical activity and social isolation occur. Identifying the factors that cause falls after stroke will contribute to the recovery process by preventing complications by taking the necessary precautions and increasing the patient's participation in rehabilitation. This study was planned to determine the frequency of falls in patients with acute stroke and to determine the risk factors associated with recurrent falls within the first six months after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fall","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":147,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Fall evaluation","description":"Evaluation of the frequency of falls in patients with acute stroke and determining the risk factors associated with recurrent falls within the first six months after stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency of fall","description":"The frequency of recurrent falls were were determined by questioning the patients.","timeFrame":"Six month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Factors related with recurrent falls","description":"Poor postural control, number of falls,fear of falling, functional disability, ambulation level of the patients will be evaluated.","timeFrame":"Six month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
