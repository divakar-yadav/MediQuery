The electronic patient records of FinCV-study patients are reviewed to collect data on anticoagulation, number of cardioversions as well as mortality and stroke data. We seek to explore the possible association between the frequency of AF paroxysms in low stroke risk patients and the occurrence of death, stroke and major bleed as well as the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation. Data collection is performed by reviewing electronic patient records."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No oral anticoagulation","description":"Patients without oral anticoagulation for AF"},{"label":"Oral anticoagulation","description":"Patients with long term oral anticoagulation","interventionNames":["Drug: Anticoagulation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anticoagulation Therapy","description":"Long term oral anticoagulation with VKA (vitamin K antagonist) or NOAC (non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant)","armGroupLabels":["Oral anticoagulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death","description":"Death from any cause","timeFrame":"From the first cardioversion through study completion, an average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Ischemic stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack)","description":"Ischemic stroke or TIA diagnosed by neurologist","timeFrame":"From the first cardioversion through study completion, an average of 6 years"},{"measure":"Major Bleed","description":"Major Bleeding complication according to ISTH (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis)","timeFrame":"From the first cardioversion through study completion, an average of 6 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Permanent oral anticoagulation","description":"Initiation of permanent oral anticoagulation therapy, information on oral anticoaglation initiation done by reviewing electronic patient records","timeFrame":"From the first cardioversion through study completion, an average of 6 years."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (ICD-10 code I48)\n* Cardioversion for acute (\\<48 h) atrial fibrillation\n* \\>18 years of age\n* living within the catchment area of the hospital","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Original FinCV study (Airaksinen et al.
