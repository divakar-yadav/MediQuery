When these conditions become chronic, there are no approved treatments to help bolster any further recovery. In prior work, we have shown the clinical feasibility and potential of Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) as a remarkably safe form of non-invasive brain stimulation in these conditions.","detailedDescription":"In the present study, we propose taking the \"next step\" to assess whether LIFUP can affect objective and validated markers of DoC patient impairment (in the direction of lesser impairment). Specifically, patients will be admitted at Casa Colina Hospital for a 10-day (in-patient) protocol, and two follow-up sessions, conducted remotely (e.g., over the phone) at 7 and 30-days post-discharge. The full length of the study is 40 days from admission. Over the admission period, patients will undergo multiple measurements of validated biomarkers, including behavioral testing, brain metabolism (using Positron Emission Tomography), and electroencephalography, before and after one session of LIFUP to thalamus."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disorder of Consciousness","Vegetative State","Minimally Conscious State","Minimally Conscious State Plus","Minimally Conscious State Minus","Traumatic Brain Injury","CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","Anoxia, Brain","Thalamic Infarction","Coma; Prolonged"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"A single group model is when a group of subjects is administered treatment/exposure to device.

Following LIFUP, the patient will undergo a second EEG session, except for the EEG cap being fit to the patient's head prior to the LIFUP session so that, as soon as LIFUP administration is complete, the EEG paradigm can be promptly administered. The patient will then be allowed to rest (\\~1h).The patient will then be administered a second dose of tracer in order to undergo a second PET measurement.
