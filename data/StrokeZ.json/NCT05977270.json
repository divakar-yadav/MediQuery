A score of 0 indicates that the patient is a non-functional ambulator, a score of 1, 2 or 3 denotes a dependent ambulator who requires assistance from another person in the form of continuous manual contact (1), continuous or intermittent manual contact (2), or verbal supervision/guarding (3) and a score of 4 or 5 describes an independent ambulator who can walk freely on: level surfaces only (4) or any surface (5=maximum score).","timeFrame":"Change from baseline to intervention phase"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale change","description":"In this 14-item scale, patients must maintain positions and complete moving tasks of varying difficulty. In most items, patients must maintain a given position for a specified time. Patients receive a score from 0-4 on their ability to meet these balance dimensions. A global score can be calculated out of 56. A score of 0 represents an inability to complete the item, and a score of 56 represents the ability to independently complete the item.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline to intervention phase"},{"measure":"Fatigue Severity Scale change","description":"A 9-item questionnaire with questions related to how fatigue interferes with certain activities and rates its severity according to a self-report scale. The items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The minimum score = 9 and maximum score possible = 63.
