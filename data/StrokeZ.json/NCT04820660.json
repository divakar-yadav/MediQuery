It affects the arteries which supply blood to and within the brain. If the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, it will not be able to receive oxygen and the nutrients which are transported by those arteries. This leads to the death of brain cells having a magnificent effect on the function of that part.","detailedDescription":"This study was quasi-experimental trial, to compare the effectiveness of Progressive Resistive Strength Exercises and Balance Exercises in subjects with Stroke. Subjects with Stroke meeting the predetermined inclusion \\& exclusion criteria were divided into two groups using lottery method. Pre assessment was done using Berg Balance Scale, Fugl Meyer Assessment - Lower Extremity and Step Test.\n\nSubjects in one group were treated with Progressive Resistive Strength Training and other group was treated with Balance training. Each subject received 12 treatment sessions, with 03 treatment sessions per week. Results were recorded at the end of 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th treatment sessions. Recorded values were analysed using SPSS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Balance","progressive resistance strength training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Task oriented Strength training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standing and reaching in different directions Sit-to-stand Stepping forward and backward Stepping sideways onto blocks","interventionNames":["Other: Task orientated strengthening training"]},{"label":"Balance Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stepping forward, backward, and sideways on the exercise step; Stepping over blocks of various heights; Standing up from a chair, From a sitting position on a 65-cm Swiss ball, Arms; bending the trunk forward and side to side); Performing double-legged stance Performing tandem stance Rising from a chair without the use of the arms; Walking forward and backward with a tandem walking pattern Performing single- legged stance","interventionNames":["Other: Balance training exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Task orientated strengthening training","description":"1.
