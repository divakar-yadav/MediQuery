The mechanisms behind these complications are not well understood. Evidence suggests that inflammation plays a central role. With the present proof-of-concept prospective cohort study, the investigators aim to demonstrate that patients develop cardiac inflammation after stroke by performing positron emission tomography (PET) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart within 15 days after stroke. As a secondary aim, the investigators will evaluate whether post-stroke cardiac inflammation persists at 3 months after stroke. The control group will be comprised of age- and sex-matched individuals without stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Inflammation"],"keywords":["stroke","PET/MRI","Inflammation","Heart"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cases (Ischemic stroke)","description":"Left and right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke Patients presenting with acute onset focal neurological deficits and DWI-MRI evidence of an acute brain infarct of the left or right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: cardiac PET/MRI","Diagnostic Test: Inflammatory markers","Diagnostic Test: Diagnostic Test: NT-proBNP"]},{"label":"Controls (TIA)","description":"Patients with acute focal neurological symptoms without brain infarct on MRI.
