Rehabilitation therapy activities largely do not address CP's well-being. The investigators have developed a theory-based, family-centered intervention, Carepartner Collaborative Integrated Therapy (CARE-CITE) designed to positively engage CPs during SS daily activities and rehabilitation exercise practice in the home setting. Using a web-based program with exemplary interactive videos of family scenarios in the home, CARE-CITE guides the CP in collaborative goal setting and creating an autonomy-supportive environment with the SS to promote motivation and creative problem-solving. To date, CARE-CITE has been evaluated in SS with chronic stroke and coupled with upper extremity therapy interventions. Promising preliminary data showed improvement in CP psychosocial outcomes and SS upper extremity function. The potential impact of CARE-CITE on SS mobility and gait recovery is unknown.\n\nThe investigators now seek to broaden the scope of the intervention by pairing CARE-CITE with home-based gait and functional mobility training (CARE-CITE-Gait). The goal of this proposal is to assess the impact of a novel home-based CARE-CITE-Gait intervention using a user-friendly telehealth delivery system. Aim 1 will evaluate usability, acceptability, and feasibility of CARE-CITE-Gait. Aim 2 will use a single site, quasi-experimental design with repeated measures (two baseline visits, post, and 1-month follow-up) to test 4-weeks of CARE-CITE-Gait in 15 CP/SS dyads to determine if similar positive outcomes are seen. Wearable sensors will be used to evaluate physical activity within the home and community. These data will support a larger randomized controlled trial testing the CARE-CITE-Gait intervention.\n\nStudy participants will be identified and recruited with successful techniques established by the PI (Blanton) and Co-I (Kesar) within the Emory Healthcare system and regional Atlanta hospitals, partnering with clinical staff for referrals and meeting with local stroke support groups. All Emory Rehabilitation Hospital stroke admissions will be screened based upon study inclusion/exclusion criteria and contacted by the research coordinator, if eligible. Participant eligibility will be confirmed via telephone screen, and initial clinical evaluation will follow at the Emory Rehabilitation Clinic. Eligible dyads (CP and SS) will be consented and evaluated at Emory Rehabilitation Hospital. Administration of CARE-CITE Gait intervention will occur in participants' homes over a period of 4 weeks, which includes CP review of the online CARE-CITE Gait education modules, two 2-hour home visits and 2 telerehabilitation check in video conference calls. All dyads will receive compensation for study participation at the end of the 1-month follow-up or prorated based on completed study evaluations.\n\nThe overall impact of this work is the development of innovative family-centered telerehabilitation interventions to improve self-management and physical activity. By providing a family-focused approach to gait and physical activity interventions, this project will help develop more effective treatments that improve both carepartner and stroke survivor outcomes after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Telehealth","Rehabilitation","Care partner","Sub-acute stroke","CARE-CITE Gait","Stroke survivors","Caregiver"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CARE-CITE GAIT Carepartner","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This study arm consists of carepartners (CP) receiving the CARE-CITE Gait intervention.
