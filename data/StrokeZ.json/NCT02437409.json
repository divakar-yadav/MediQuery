The effectiveness, safety and the long-term success when using the pREset to treat acute occlusions of cerebral vessels will be analyzed.\n\nIn this study the market-approved, self-expandable stent retriever (pREset, phenox GmbH, Germany) will be used to achieve a direct flow recovery.\n\nThe thrombectomy system will be unfolded directly in the vessel occlusion. In a second step, the system and the thrombus will be pulled back into the guide catheter.\n\nIt is planned to enroll 100 patients at the age of 18 until 85 years, with a NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) ≥ 8 and ≤ 30. The preconditions for study enrollment are the written consent of the patient or of the legal representative and the fulfillment of all mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pregnant women are excluded from study participation.The clinical interventions are in accordance with the clinical standard of care for the treatment of this patient population.\n\nThe mRS (Modified Rankin Scale) on day 30, the NIHSS on day 90 and an imaging procedure on day 90 may be performed by the study site provided that it corresponds to the clinical standards of the study site."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":115,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"pREset thrombectomy retriever","description":"Interventional recanalization of acute cerebral vessel occlusions with the pREset thrombectomy system alone or in combination with intravenous or intraarterial thrombolytics (rt-PA)."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological Condition of the Patient","description":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS)\n\nNeurological Condition is measured by the \"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)\".
