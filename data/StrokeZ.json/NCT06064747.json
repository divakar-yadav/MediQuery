The site of acute occlusion of the responsible vessel was located in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery, T-type bifurcation or M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, planning for bridging therapy (bridging intravascular therapy after intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase) or direct intravascular therapy, the time from stroke onset to the start of the trial intervention was less than 24 hours (when the exact time of onset was unknown, the patient's\"Last apparent normal time\" was defined as the time of onset).\n\nEnrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the\"LF-rTMS group\" or the\"Sham Stimulation Group\" and received:\n\n1. LF-rTMS group: using \"8\" coil,1-Hz rTMS to stimulate the M1 region of the ipsilateral hemisphere, the stimulation intensity was RMT 100%, 1200pulses/session, two sessions (2400 pulses)/day (interval ≥ 2 hours), lasting 3 days (total 6 sessions, 7200pulses);\n2.
