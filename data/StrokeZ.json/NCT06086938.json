Using the personalized brain functional sectors (pBFS) technique, we could precisely identify individualized brain functional networks and the personalized language-related stimulation site based on the resting-state functional MRI data. The current study proposes to conduct a double-blinded, randomized and parallel controlled design trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of pBFS-guided personalized cTBS combined with iTBS intervention in post-stroke aphasic patients.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to the following two groups: active TBS（cTBS+iTBS）group, or a sham TBS（sham cTBS+sham iTBS）group. The allocation ratio will be 1:1. The stimulation protocol consisted of a 3-week treatment, with five consecutive days each week (totally 15 day-treatment) .The stimulation procedure will be assisted with real-time neuronavigation to ensure its precision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active TBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active TBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: active cTBS combined with iTBS"]},{"label":"sham TBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham TBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: sham cTBS combined with iTBS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active cTBS combined with iTBS","description":"Daily TBS treatment consists of the following combination: active 600-pulse cTBS applied to the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in the unaffected hemisphere + active 600-pulse iTBS applied to the SFG in the affected hemisphere + 15 minutes of rest + active 600-pulse cTBS applied to the SFG in the unaffected hemisphere + active 600-pulses iTBS applied to the SFG in the affected hemisphere, totaling 2400 pulses of TBS intervention.\n\nThe intervention mentioned above will be administered once per day with five consecutive days per week, continuously for three weeks.","armGroupLabels":["active TBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham cTBS combined with iTBS","description":"Daily sham TBS treatment consists of the following combination: sham 600-pulse cTBS applied to the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in the unaffected hemisphere + sham 600-pulse iTBS applied to the SFG in the affected hemisphere + 15 minutes of rest + sham 600-pulse cTBS applied to the SFG in the unaffected hemisphere + 600-pulse sham iTBS applied to the SFG in the affected hemisphere, totaling 2400 pulses of sham TBS intervention.\n\nThe intervention mentioned above will be administered once per day with five consecutive days per week, continuously for three weeks.","armGroupLabels":["sham TBS group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Western Aphasia Battery scores","description":"The first four subsets of the WAB (Spontaneous Speech, Auditory verbal comprehension, Repetition, Naming and word finding) will be used to evaluate the participants' language ability impairments.
