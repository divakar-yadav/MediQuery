However, the opportunity to monitor vital signs is largely limited to the time a patient spends at a healthcare providers premises. This study is being conducted to see if the use of small wearable monitoring devices could help deliver a better service and improve patient care by continuing to monitor patients remotely.\n\nThe study is observational and has been designed to address two key questions:\n\n1. Is it possible in principle to use the information captured from the devices to improve the treatment of the patient?\n2. How practical is it to implement remote patient monitoring (RPM)?\n\nTo address these questions, consenting patients will be asked to wear a small adhesive biosensor for a short period of time following discharge from hospital (either as an outpatient or inpatient).\n\nThe data gathered by the device will be examined retrospectively and patients will not be monitored in real-time. Following the monitoring period, the vital signs data captured by the device will be analysed to see if it correlates with any unscheduled healthcare needs (such as unplanned GP appointments or emergency hospital visits). Specifically, the study team will be investigating whether the monitoring could have picked up a nascent problem before it became more serious, or whether monitoring could have saved the patient from having to make a trip to see their GP.\n\nInformation regarding the practicalities of implementing RPM will be captured by monitoring compliance and through an exit interview with participating patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure","Cardiovascular Diseases","Respiratory Disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient compliance","description":"The percentage of all participating patients for whom a complete and unbroken record of their vital signs is obtained throughout the duration of the agreed monitoring period.","timeFrame":"7 days (the monitoring period)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Device comfort assessed by a 5-point rating scale","description":"Participants will be asked to rate how comfortable they found the device to wear during a telephone administered exit interview.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Convenience of remote monitoring assessed by a 5-point rating scale","description":"Participants will be asked how the remote monitoring device affected their daily routine during a telephone administered exit interview.
