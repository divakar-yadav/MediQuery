We want to assess which one of these markers has the best prognosis value , in a prospective study of 300 stroke patients followed during 3 years.","detailedDescription":"Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA will be included in the 48 hours following the onset of symptoms, in 3 university hospitals.For each patient will be collected\n\n* 1 blood sample for the BNP measure in pg/ml\n* 1 blood sample for the Cystatin C measure in mg/l\n* 2 urinary samples to measure the albumine/creatinine ratio, at inclusion and 5 days after the inclusion, and to study the variation of albuminuria in micrograms/min.\n\nThe clinical follow-up will be organized during 3 years. The following events will be notified: poor outcome (defined with the Barthel and Rankin scores), recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, vascular death.\n\nAfter adjustment on the main clinical prognosis factors, we want to determine wich one of these markers has the best prognosis significance and allows to identify in the acute phase the \"high-risk\" patients, in order to intensify individual treatment and secondary prevention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["stroke","transient ischemic attack","albuminuria","BNP","Cystatin C"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood Urine"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":159,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke or TIA in the first 48 hours following the onset of symptoms\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient unable to give an informed consent\n* Urinary sample impossible to collect","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient with Ischemic stroke or TIA","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"BONNAUD Isabelle, MD","affiliation":"Service de Neurologie / CHRU de Tours","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service de Neurologie / Hopital LAENNEC","city":"Nantes","zip":"44093","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.21725,"lon":-1.55336}},{"facility":"Service de neurologie / CHU Pontchaillou","city":"Rennes","zip":"35033","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.11198,"lon":-1.67429}},{"facility":"Service de Neurologie / CHRU de Tours","city":"Tours","zip":"37044","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.38333,"lon":0.68333}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3456","name":"Albuminuria","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21625","name":"Natriuretic Peptide, Brain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18113","name":"Cystatins","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"NaAg","name":"Natriuretic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
