Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive a Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection 25mg/5ml,once/day from Day 1 to Day 14（the injection must be added slowly into 0.9% sodium chloride injection diluted to 250 ml , intravenous drip for about 2 hours）, combined with Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) at a dose of 100 mg/d for 90 days;2) the other group will receive the same volume saline injection as placebo for 14 days plus aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.The primary objective is to assess the anti-platelet effects of Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection combined with Aspirin versus Aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The study consists of 3 visits including the day of randomization, Day 14±2days and Day 90±7days.After randomized to 90 + 7 days mRS 0-1 points is the Primary Outcome Measure,evaluate the safety and effectivity of Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection tn the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by Ethics Committee of Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous injections of Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection at a dose of 25 mg (5ml) diluted with 250 ml physiological saline for 14 days ;Aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection","Drug: Aspirin"]},{"label":"Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous injections of Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation at a dose of 25 mg (5ml) diluted with 250 ml physiological saline for 14 days ;Aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation","Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection","description":"Intravenous injections of Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection at a dose of 25 mg (5ml) diluted with 250 ml physiological saline for 14 days plus aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.","armGroupLabels":["Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection"],"otherNames":["YinxingErtieneizhiPu'an Zhusheye"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation","description":"Intravenous injections of Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation at a dose of 25 mg (5ml) diluted with 250 ml physiological saline for 14 days plus aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.","armGroupLabels":["Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation"],"otherNames":["YinxingErtieneizhiPu'an Zhusheye simulation"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"plus aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.","armGroupLabels":["Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection","Ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine injection simulation"],"otherNames":["Acetylsalicylic acid"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"Proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) less than or equal to 1 .
