The patient in the chronic phase of stroke may suffer from long term hand disability along with both motor and sensory dysfunction. That causes hindrance in performing the ADLs. As the hand is the important organ performing major functions of daily living .So the early restoration of the motor as well as sensory function is necessary.\n\nThe motive of this study IS to determine effects of proprioceptive activities on hand function in chronic stroke patients. Total 40 chronic stroke patients will be included in the study. They will be randomly allocated in two groups by lottery method that fulfills the inclusion criteria of the study. In group A patients will be recruited and proprioceptive activities will be given to the affected hand for 3 days /week for 2 months. On the other hand in group B conventional therapy will be given for 3 days /week for 2 months. In sensory training graphesthesia and stereognosis will be checked by modified subtest of sensory integration praxis test and Byl-Cheney-Boczai Sensory Discriminator Test respectively. The motor task will be assessed by the wolf motor test. As a baseline treatment hot pack for 15 min will be given to both of the groups"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Proprioceptive Disorders"],"keywords":["graphesthesia","stereognosis","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in the experimental group will get the hot pack initially for 15 minutes .Then for proprioception training of graphesthesia for 15 mints, therapist repeatedly draw some letter, figures, digit, shapes ,alphabets on the palm of hand/digits of patient.For Stereognosis therapist command the patient to close his or her eyes, then on affected hand put some different kinds of objects and shapes then ask the patient to identify that object, the object might be of any kind like a key, rubber a block or a coin etc. Total time for stereognosis was 15 minutes. For motor training patients were guided by the therapist to use his or her affected hand more.
