Despite their relatively high frequency, there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients. However, the fact that AIS related to MeVO often results in significant disability despite best medical treatment (including intravenous thrombolysis, IVT) calls for novel treatment approaches. Fortunately, a growing number of non-randomized studies have now been published demonstrating the feasibility of endovascular treatment (EVT) for MeVO strokes. These studies have demonstrated that distal EVT leads to high rates of successful reperfusion and may be performed with a comparable safety profile to that of EVT for proximal arterial occlusions. Therefore, a strong rational exists to test the safety and efficacy of EVT for MeVO stokes in a prospective randomized clinical trial.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that endovascular thrombectomy is superior to standard medical management in achieving more favorable outcomes according to the modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days in subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke related to a distal medium vessel occlusion within 12 hours from symptom onset (defined as time last know well, TLKW).\n\nSecondary objectives include the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of endovascular thrombectomy in the medium vessel occlusion (MeVO) population as well as its impact on health-related quality of life.\n\nStudy design: The study is a prospective, multicenter, investigational, randomized, controlled, open-label study with blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE design) and an adaptive design with population enrichment.\n\nStudy population: Subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 12 hours from TLKW and whose strokes are attributable to a distal medium vascular occlusion defined as co/non-dominant M2 segment or M3 segment of the MCA, the ACA (A1, A2, or A3 segments), or the PCA (P1, P2 or P3 segments) with evidence of salvageable brain tissue on perfusion imaging, M2 segment vessel diameter should not exceed 2.5 mm.\n\nPrimary outcome: Shift in distribution of all levels of the 90-day the modified Rankin Scale with levels 5-6 combined (mRS; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-6) as assessed by structured assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Thrombectomy"],"keywords":["Medium Vessel Occlusion","Stroke Due To Medium Vessel Occlusion","Endovascular Treatment","Standard Medical Management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":564,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular treatment+ standard medical management","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For the subjects randomized to endovascular treatment (EVT), treatment initiation is defined as the date and time of arterial puncture.
