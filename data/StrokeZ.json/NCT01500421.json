Soon after arrival in the stroke unit patients are randomized to either hypothermia in the intensive care unit (ICU) or standard treatment in the stroke ward.\n\nPatients randomized to therapeutic hypothermia are analgo-sedated and cooled to at temperature of 33 degrees for a period of 24 hours.","detailedDescription":"Ischemic stroke remains a diagnosis with limited treatment opportunities and a treatment with the ability to target patients outside the normal treatment window is wanted.\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia (TH) treatment has long been recognised as a treatment of patients with global ischemia following caridac arrest.\n\nThis trial is designed to address the safty and feasibility of TH in acute stroke patients.\n\nPatients arriving in our stroke ward are observed for 3 hours. Only non-remitting patients are allowed into the trial.\n\nPatients are randomized to either therapeutic hypothermia with endovascular catheter + nasopharyngeal induction or endovascular catheter alone in the intensive care unit (ICU) (in Copenhagen, Denmark) or intravenous cold saline infusion followed by surface cooling (in Malmø, Sweden)versus standard treatment in a stoke unit.\n\nPatients brought to the ICU are sedated and mechanically ventilated.\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia is induced with a endovascular catether and a nasopharyngeal catheter. Body temperature is lowered to 33 degrees and sustained for a period of 24 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Hypothermia, Induced"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TH - Endovacular alone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to this arm are cooled to a bodytemperature of 33 degrees with an endovascular groin catheter (Copenhagen only).","interventionNames":["Device: TH - Endovascular alone (Alsius®, Zoll, USA)"]},{"label":"TH - Endovascular + nasopharyngeal induction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to this arm are cooled to a bodytemperature of 33 degrees with endovascular catheter along with nasopharyngeal induction (Copenhagen only).","interventionNames":["Device: TH - Endovascular + nasopharyngeal induction (Alsius®, Zoll, USA) (Rhinochill®, Benechill, USA)"]},{"label":"Standard Treatment","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients are treated with standard care in the stroke ward."},{"label":"TH - Surface Cooling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to this arm are cooled to a bodytemperature of 33 degrees with cold saline infusion followed by surface cooling with Arctic Sun Cooling system, Medivance, USA (Malmø only)","interventionNames":["Device: Intravenous cold saline and surface cooling (Arctic Sun, Medivance, USA)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"TH - Endovascular alone (Alsius®, Zoll, USA)","description":"Patients are cooled with an endovascular (Alsius®, Zoll, USA) groin catether (9,3 french).","armGroupLabels":["TH - Endovacular alone"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"TH - Endovascular + nasopharyngeal induction (Alsius®, Zoll, USA) (Rhinochill®, Benechill, USA)","description":"Patient are cooled with a groin endovascular catheter (Alsius®, Zoll, USA) + a nasopharyngeal induction catheter (Rhinochill®, Benechill, USA) in the nostrils.
