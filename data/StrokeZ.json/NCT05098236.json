The investigators will also assess the effect of intensive visual retraining on the residual visual system, processing of visual information and the use of such information in real-world situations following damage. This research is intended to improve our understanding of the consequences of permanent visual system damage in humans, of methods that can be used to reverse visual loss, and of brain mechanisms by which visual recovery is achieved."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vision Loss Partial","Hemianopia","Hemianopia Homonymous","Quadrantanopia","Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":280,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cortically Blind Subjects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Training in the Blind Field"]},{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Training in the Sighted Field"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Training in the Blind Field","description":"A computer software and chin-rest necessary to perform visual training will be loaned to each subject to be used at home.
