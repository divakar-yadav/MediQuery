It is essential to plan therapeutic techniques to recover from the stroke. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of myofascial release with the tennis ball on spasticity and motor functions of the upper extremity in patients with chronic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Myofascial release is a therapeutic technique that aims to improve flexibility and sliding between layers of soft tissues, reduce the severity of muscle activity pain, and improve functional performance. A previous study included myofascial release with a tennis ball in the lower extremity in patients with chronic stroke and reported improved balance. Different other unique therapeutic interventions have been proposed over the past two decades for stroke management; however, myofascial release with a tennis ball has not been included in them. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effects of myofascial release with a tennis ball on spasticity and motor functions of the upper limb in patients with chronic stroke.\n\nParticipants were equally divided into two groups viz. experimental and control, with 11 participants in each group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Myofascial release","Chronic stroke","Motor functions","Spasticity","modified Ashworth scale","Fugl-Meyer assessment scale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two-arm parallel pre-test-post-test experimental design.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Myofascial Release Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants were treated with a conventional physiotherapy program along with myofascial release with a tennis ball.","interventionNames":["Other: Myofascial release technique along with conventional physiotherapy exercises"]},{"label":"Conventional Physiotherapy Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A conventional physiotherapy program was provided including range of motion/flexibility exercises, strength training, postural control, functional mobility exercises, lower limb functional exercises, and gait training.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physiotherapy exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Myofascial release technique along with conventional physiotherapy exercises","description":"Myofascial release technique was performed using a tennis ball along with conventional physiotherapy exercises.","armGroupLabels":["Myofascial Release Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional physiotherapy exercises","description":"Conventional physiotherapy exercises were performed including the range of motion/flexibility exercises, strength training, postural control, functional exercises, and gait training.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Physiotherapy Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Spasticity","description":"Spasticity measured using Modified Ashworth scale - Scores range from 0 to 4, where lower scores represent normal muscle tone and higher scores represent spasticity.","timeFrame":"4 weeks."},{"measure":"Upper limb motor functions","description":"Upper limb motor functions measured using Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale - Scores range from 0-66, where lower score represent poor performance of upper extremity and higher scores represents good performance of upper extremity","timeFrame":"4 weeks."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unilateral stroke,\n* Hemiplegia with upper extremity dysfunctions of more than 6 months and less than 2 years of duration\n* modified Ashworth scale of grade 1-3,\n* Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) \\>24 suggesting intact cognition,\n* full passive range of motion of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand joints\n* voluntary control by Brunnstrom of grade 3-5 for shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* circulatory problems such as deep vein thrombosis,\n* impaired sensation over the affected upper limb,\n* recently injured area/open wounds,\n* arthritic or any other musculoskeletal condition of the upper extremity, shoulder instability based on the posterior or anterior apprehension test, and positive sulcus test,\n* history of brain surgery after stroke,\n* Botox injection in the past four months,\n* medically unstable patients,\n* patients who have had multiple strokes.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Masood Khan, M.P.Th","affiliation":"King Saud University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"King Saud University","city":"Riyadh","zip":"11433","country":"Saudi Arabia","geoPoint":{"lat":24.68773,"lon":46.72185}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35945719","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Parikh RJ, Sutaria JM, Ahsan M, Nuhmani S, Alghadir AH, Khan M.
