The emergent IV dye preparation consists of diphenhydramine 50 mg IV once, famotidine 20 mg IV once, and dexamethasone 10 mg IV once, followed immediately by Computed Tomography (CT) Angiography and/or CT Perfusion.","detailedDescription":"Patients with documented IV dye allergy were given emergent dye preparation immediately prior to advanced neuroimaging that consisted of three drugs: diphenydramine 50 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV, and dexamethasone 10 mg IV. In contrast, elective dye preparation commonly done in non-emergent or outpatient settings is separated into two different options. The first option is for a patient to take Prednisone 50 mg three times prior to the study: one tablet by mouth 13 hours prior, one tablet by mouth seven hours prior, and the last tablet by mouth one hour prior to the study. The second option is for the patient to be prescribed dexamethasone 4 mg or 6 mg dispensed four times: two tablets by mouth 12 hours prior to the study and 2 tablets by mouth one hour prior to the study. If the patient is prescribed dexamethasone, they also take famotidine 150 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg, both drugs by mouth 12 hours prior and one hour prior to the study.\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between dye allergy and any adverse reactions, our study's inclusion criteria consisted of all stroke alert patients from 2021-2022 who required advanced neuroimaging of CTP/CTA and received emergent IV dye preparation. Exclusion criteria included patients who reported dye allergies specific to airway edema or anaphylaxis. A retrospective chart review was done to evaluate stroke patient's stated allergies, the number of patients that received emergent IV dye preparation, and any adverse reactions despite the emergent IV dye preparation. Data was then analyzed to determine if there was a relationship between prior contrast dye allergy and allergic reactions that occurred after emergent IV dye administration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dye Allergy"],"keywords":["Stroke","Emergent IV Dye Prep","Dye Allergy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Emergent IV Dye Preparation & Administration","description":"The emergent IV dye drug trio is administered and followed immediately by Computed Tomography (CT) Angiography and/or CT Perfusion.","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Emergent IV Dye Preparation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Emergent IV Dye Preparation","description":"Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV once, famotidine 20 mg IV once, and dexamethasone 10 mg IV once","armGroupLabels":["Emergent IV Dye Preparation & Administration"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse Reactions","description":"Unwanted side effects of medication administration, including but not limited to itching, rash, mild shortness of breath etc.","timeFrame":"24 Hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria: Stroke alert patients that required advanced neuroimaging of CTP/CTA and received emergent IV dye preparation -\n\nExclusion Criteria: patients who reported dye allergies specific to airway edema or anaphylaxis\n\n-","sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke alert patients with a history of dye allergies.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.95233,"lon":-75.16379}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000006967","term":"Hypersensitivity"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9708","name":"Hypersensitivity","asFound":"Allergy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9890","name":"Immune System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M6792","name":"Dexamethasone","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17993","name":"Famotidine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M235506","name":"Dexamethasone acetate","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7028","name":"Diphenhydramine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13958","name":"Promethazine","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Infl","name":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents"},{"abbrev":"ANeo","name":"Antineoplastic Agents"},{"abbrev":"AnEm","name":"Antiemetics"},{"abbrev":"Gast","name":"Gastrointestinal Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"AAll","name":"Anti-Allergic Agents"},{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"Derm","name":"Dermatologic Agents"}]}},"hasResults":false}
