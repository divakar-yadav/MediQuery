For asymptomatic patients, AHA guidelines recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for stenosis 60% to 99%, if the risk of perioperative stroke or death is less than 3%.\n\nAlthough clinical trial data support CEA in asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis 60% to 79%, the AHA guidelines indicate that some physicians delay revascularization until there is greater than 80% stenosis in asymptomatic patients.\n\nOur study is designed to determine whether optimal medical therapy alone reduces the risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients with carotid artery stenosis as compared with CEA coupled with optimal medical therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Stenosis","Atherosclerosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis","Carotid Endarterectomy","Stroke","Cerebrovascular","Atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CEA Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and receive medical treatment including medical therapy with statins (at least 10 mg atorvastatin irrespective of the baseline cholesterol level), aspirin (100 mg daily) and antihypertensive therapy (at least 50 mg losartan and 5 mg amlodipine 75 mg daily irrespective of the baseline arterial pressure level).
