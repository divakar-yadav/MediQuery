Those with hyperglycaemia tend to progress to a larger final stroke size. Diabetes and hyperglycaemia may affect the ability of the patient to clinically improve, independent of the degree of initial impairment. We will perform a retrospective review of medical records of stroke patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit. We will compare outcomes of changes in disability scales (FIM and Barthel) from admission to discharge, length of stay and hospital events between those with and without diabetes. Amongst those with diabetes, we will also assess whether those with higher mean blood glucose levels during their inpatient rehabilitation stay have worse outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Diabetes","Hyperglycemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inpatient rehabilitation for acute stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Medical records unavailable","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke rehab patients","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Leo Rando, MBBS FRACP","affiliation":"Melbourne Health","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"The Royal Melbourne Hospital","city":"Melbourne","state":"Victoria","zip":"3050","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-37.814,"lon":144.96332}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"},{"id":"D000006943","term":"Hyperglycemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6805","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9684","name":"Hyperglycemia","asFound":"Hyperglycemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25093","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7552","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
