Hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, will be randomized into two arms (1:1): an intervention arm and a control arm.\n\nHospitals in the intervention arm will receive a multilevel intervention based on the AACTT theory, whereas hospitals in the control arm will receive no intervention and maintain routine care. All the hospitals will receive electronic monitoring.
