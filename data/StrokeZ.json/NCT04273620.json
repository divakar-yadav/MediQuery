Patients are unaware of objects, persons and even own body parts in the (usually left) hemispace opposite to their brain lesion. While there is spontaneous remission in some patients, neglect symptoms persist in many stroke survivors which is associated with a poor functional outcome. Although different therapeutic approaches (including cognitive interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation and drugs) have been investigated in the last decades, an established therapy is still missing. Hence, there is a clear need for an effective and feasible intervention that can be applied in rehabilitation centers.\n\nThis study is dedicated to assess the effect of a cognitive treatment consisting of combined optokinetic stimulation (OKS) and cueing-based reading therapy (READ) on hemispatial neglect and the neglect-related functional disability in right-hemisphere stroke patients. It will be a mono-centric, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Using a crossover design with two arms, patients will either receive the intervention therapy (OKS-READ) first and subsequently the control treatment (neuropsychological training not targeting visuospatial attention) or they will start in the control arm and then switch to the intervention. Each treatment phase consists of 15 therapy sessions lasting 30 to 45 minutes. The outcome will be assessed at different time points, including established neuropsychological tests for spatial neglect and a clinical score of neglect-related functional disability.","detailedDescription":"see above"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spatial Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"This study will be a mono-centric, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.

Furthermore, the assessment of neglect severity by use of a computerized neuropsychological test battery is robust and objective and largely independent of the investigator who is administering the test.","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention-Control (IC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the Intervention-Control (IC) arm, patients will first receive the intervention (OKS-READ) containing 15 individual therapy sessions within a maximum time period of 28 days.
