The condition usually resolves within a few days or weeks of onset with no residual impairments. However, resolution in some cases extends over a period of months rather than weeks and may be incomplete. The purpose of this case report is to provide an in-depth description of the progression of changes in cognitive and language functioning for a person exhibiting SMART syndrome characterized by slow recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine Disorders","Aphasia"],"keywords":["Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Language treatment","description":"Individual speech-language therapy sessions totaling 1.5 to 2.5 hours five days per week.
