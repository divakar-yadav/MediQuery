Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the mortality rate of SAP. The Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula (TFXS) was shown to be effective for the prevention and treatment SAP in a previous clinical trial. To clarify whether TFXS is effective and safe for the treatment of SAP and affects the immunological mechanism of the \"brain-gut-lung\" pathway of SAP, the investigators designed this study.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 218 patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG) in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment course will be 10-12 consecutive days, with a 90±7-day follow-up. The primary outcome is the all-cause mortality rate and the mortality of pneumonia at the 90±7-day follow-up. Secondary outcomes include changes in the gut microbiota; changes in the NIHSS score, BI index, mRS score, and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life scale (SS-QOL) score; and so on."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Complication"],"keywords":["stroke-associated pneumonia","Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula","Traditional Chinese medicine","Brain-gut-lung axis","Randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":218,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula prescription (0.4g\\*36 capsules/bottle，1-4 capsules each time, three times a day.) for 10-12days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tongfu capsules"]},{"label":"The Placebo of Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The Placebo of Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula prescription (0.4g\\*36 capsules/bottle，1-4 capsules each time, three times a day.) for 10-12 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: The Placebo of Tongfu capsules"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tongfu capsules","description":"Tongfu capsules include 5 herbals","armGroupLabels":["Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"The Placebo of Tongfu capsules","description":"The Placebo of Tongfu capsules are made from dextrin, starch and so on.","armGroupLabels":["The Placebo of Tong-Fu-Xing-Shen herbal formula"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the all-cause mortality rate","description":"Any cause of death","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"the mortality of stroke associated pneumonia","description":"the death of stroke associated pneumonia","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"changes in the gut microbiota between the experiment group and the control group","description":"gut microbiota is monitored via 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis","timeFrame":"Baseline (before drug), after drug 10-12 days"},{"measure":"National Institute of Health of stroke scale （NIHSS）","description":"The NIHSS is for evaluation of neurological deficits.
