In addition, to incorporate the relatively unsupervised home care into the rehabilitation process, clinicians require a better means to assess functional gains and provide effective training tools. Our goal is to develop a personalized training and clinical assessment instrument based on the Video-Based F-PAT (Functional Performance Assessment and Training) which relies on the manipulation of digitized videoclips. Our development objectives are (1) to enhance the pilot F-PAT web site to allow clinicians password-protected access to the digitized video and assessment information; and (2) to train an Occupational Therapist collaborator to create the personalized videotapes for patients to take home with them. Our clinical objective is to implement a 2-year evaluation of the F-PAT design concept with 30 subjects, divided in 3 groups, who as patients undergo acute rehabilitation at the VA Comprehensive Rehabilitation Center and are discharged to their homes or a sub-acute facility. This study has the dual goal of evaluating the effectiveness of the personalized training videotapes and the effectiveness of the video-based assessment methodology.\n\nThe study will divide the subjects into three treatment groups to compare the effectiveness of accepted practice, generic videotape, and personalized videotape home-based instruction for clients and care providers. Comparison of outcomes will be done using videotape of task performance before release from the acute therapy program and at the follow-up evaluation one month later. The subjects will be evaluated by a blinded physiatrist viewing and rating digitized videoclips of task performance on the F-PAT web site. This study will determine if personalized videoclip-based instructional material is effective, and if videoclip comparisons by a clinician is an effective diagnosis and assessment instrument. If it is not possible for logistical reasons for a subject to return to the clinic for the follow-on evaluation, the F-PAT team will visit the subject's home and perform the videotaping on-site. The remainder of the evaluation with input from the physiatrist will occur subsequently at the clinic."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hemiplegia","elderly","Video","F-PAT,Functional Performance","digitized videoclips"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Stroke Rehabilitation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Hemiplegic patients","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"John Fryer, Ph.D., Asst.
