Even among those who achieve independent ambulation, significant residual deficits persist in balance and gait speed with a 73 percent incidence of falls among individuals with mild to moderate impairment 6 months post-stroke. Body weight supported treadmill training is one therapeutic method for locomotor training that is rapidly being adopted into physical rehabilitation to improve walking after stroke.\n\nThe purpose of this multi-center, randomized controlled study is to compare two different treatments to improve walking after stroke. The two treatments are: 1) a training program that includes use of a body weight support system and a treadmill to practice walking and 2) a physical therapist monitored exercise program to work on general conditioning and strengthening in the patient's home. In addition, investigators will determine the best time to provide training after a stroke and if the training is beneficial for mild, moderate, or severe cases of stroke.\n\nFour hundred subjects will be recruited from five facilities in Florida and California. Screening and subject recruitment will take place within 45 days post-stroke. All stroke patients will be screened to determine eligibility for the study. Eligible subjects will be followed for 2 months post-stroke. At that time, those who are eligible for enrollment and who consent to participate will undergo an exercise tolerance test and baseline assessment. Following this evaluation, participants will be randomized into one of three groups, according to the severity of their locomotor impairment: early locomotor, late locomotor, or early home exercise.\n\nThe early locomotor training group will begin the locomotor training program immediately (2 months post stroke). The locomotor training program is an out-patient program of locomotor training for 36 sessions, 3 times per week, using a body weight support system and stepping on a treadmill. The late locomotor training group will begin locomotor training at 6 months post-stroke. Participants in the early home exercise group will receive a non-specific low intensity exercise program beginning immediately (2 months post stroke)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","locomotor","exercise","walking","training program","body weight support training","physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":408,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early Locomotor Training Program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"body weight supported training program with treadmill","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Early locomotor training program"]},{"label":"Late Locomotor Training Program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"body weight supported training program with treadmill","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Late locomotor training program"]},{"label":"Early Home Exercise Program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"a non-specific low intensity exercise program","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Home Exercise Program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Early locomotor training program","description":"The early locomotor training program is an out-patient program of locomotor training for 36 sessions, 3 times per week, using a body weight support system and stepping on a treadmill and overground training beginning at 2 months post-stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Early Locomotor Training Program"],"otherNames":["E-LTP","LTP-early"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Late locomotor training program","description":"The late locomotor training program is an out-patient program of locomotor training for 36 sessions, 3 times per week, using a body weight support system and stepping on a treadmill and overground training beginning at 6 months post-stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Late Locomotor Training Program"],"otherNames":["L-LTP","LTP-late"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Home Exercise Program","description":"Participants in the early home exercise group will receive a non-specific low intensity exercise program beginning at 2 months post stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Early Home Exercise Program"],"otherNames":["HEP"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Successfully Improved Functional Level of Walking at 1 Year Post-stroke","description":"Success: walking greater than 0.4 m/sec if baseline was less than 0.4; walking greater than 0.8 m/sec if baseline was 0.4m/sec or greater but less than 0.8 m/sec as measured during 10 meter walk.","timeFrame":"12 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Walking Speed: Measured During a 10-meter Walk","timeFrame":"Baseline and 12 months post-stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Successfully Improved Functional Level of Walking at 6 Months Post-stroke","description":"Success: walking greater than 0.4 m/sec if baseline was less than 0.4; walking greater than 0.8 m/sec if baseline was 0.4m/sec or greater but less than 0.8 m/sec as measured during 10 meter walk.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"6 Month Outcome: Walking Speed: Measured During a 10-meter Walk","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"6 Minute Walking Distance (Meters)","description":"Distance walked in 6 minutes.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Step Activity Monitor (SAM)- Median of Average Number of Steps Per Day","description":"As measured with a step activity monitor averaged over 2 days.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) - Participation","description":"Range = 0 - 100.
