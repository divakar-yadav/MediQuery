Participants were tested for different taste perception thresholds using a three-point difference test, with samples materials for basic taste stimuli used, i.e. reference substances tartaric/citric acid (acidic), quinine hydrochloride/caffeine (bitter), anhydrous sodium chloride (salty), sucrose (sweet), and quercetin/alum (astringent) were used to prepare different tastes and concentrations of liquids. The subjects will then evaluate the appearance (color, texture), taste, flavor, and texture of the six different flavored enteral nutrition preparations. The subjects will then perform manual sensory evaluation of the appearance (color, texture), odor, taste, texture, and other properties of the 6 different flavored enteral nutrition preparations.","detailedDescription":"1. Combining manual sensory evaluation and electronic bionic sensory, assessing the differences in taste perception between tumor and stroke patients and healthy individuals by measuring the basic taste perception threshold and palatability interval and analyzing facial expressions.\n2. Combining manual sensory evaluation with electronic bionic senses and simultaneous facial expression analysis to assess the taste perception characteristics and needs of tumor and stroke patients for different flavors of enteral nutrition preparations.\n3. Establishing an information base of electronic tongue taste data, facial expression emotion and flavor data of nutritional preparations based on the electronic tongue and facial expression data of relevant assays obtained simultaneously during the above experiments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer- and Cancer Treatment-Related Conditions","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":108,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients","description":"Participants were tested for different taste perception thresholds using a three-point difference test, with samples materials for basic taste stimuli were used, i.e. reference substances tartaric/citric acid (acidic), quinine hydrochloride/caffeine (bitter), anhydrous sodium chloride (salty), sucrose (sweet), and quercetin/alum (astringent) were used to prepare different tastes and concentrations of liquids.
