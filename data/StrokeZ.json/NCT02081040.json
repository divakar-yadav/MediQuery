It has been postulated that respiratory and cough function are primarily controlled by respiratory and swallowing centers located in the brainstem.We postulated that those with infratentorial brain lesions would have more impaired cough and respiratory function than those with non-brainstem lesions and supratentorial brain lesions.\n\nHowever there has been no studies whether those with infratentorial brain lesions have more impaired cough function and decreased diaphragm excursion than those with supratentorial brain lesions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["brainstem","diaphragm","deglutition disorder","sonography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Infratentorial dysphagia patients","description":"Infratentorial brain lesion patients with confirmed evidence of dysphagia"},{"label":"Supratentorial dysphagia patients","description":"Supratentorial brain lesions\\\\ patients with confirmed evidence of dysphagia"},{"label":"Brain lesion patients without dysphagia","description":"Brain lesion patients with no evidence of dysphagia","interventionNames":["Other: Not applicable (observational study with no active intervention)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Not applicable (observational study with no active intervention)","armGroupLabels":["Brain lesion patients without dysphagia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diaphragm excursion","description":"Diaphragm excursion as assessed by m mode sonography","timeFrame":"baseline one time"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximal inspiratory pressure","timeFrame":"baseline one time"},{"measure":"Peak cough flow force during voluntary coughing","timeFrame":"baseline one time"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"maximal expiratory pressure","timeFrame":"baseline one time"},{"measure":"spirometry findings","timeFrame":"baseline one time"},{"measure":"Cough force during reflexive coughing","description":"Peak flow force during reflexive coughing","timeFrame":"baseline one time"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nGroup 1- Brainstem lesion subjects with dysphagia that would require insertion of a nasogastric tube Group 2- Non-brainstem lesion subjects with dysphagia that would require insertion of a nasogastric tube Group 3- Stroke patients with no evidence of dysphagia\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Episode of acute pneumonia or pulmonary embolism at time of enrollment\n* Previous history of chronic respiratory disorders or other systemic disorders that may affect respiratory function ( ex, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic renal disease, spinal cord injury)\n* Stroke patients with multiple brain lesions\n* Episode of Diaphragm weakness due to peripheral polyneuropathy or unilateral phrenic nerve palsy\n* Previous episode of abdominal or thoracic surgery within one year of enrollment\n* Concomitant diagnosis of myopathy, muscular dystrophy or other disorders that may affect respiratory muscles.\n* Episode of rib fracture within one year of enrollment\n* Chronic alcoholism\n* Patient with previous diagnosis of dementia or with impaired cognitive function that may limit full participation at the evaluation\n* Patient with tracheostomy state","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Dysphagia patients due to brain lesions at a university affiliated hospital","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sun Im, MD PhD","affiliation":"The Catholic University of Korea","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Bucheon St Mary's Hospital","city":"Bucheon","state":"Gyonngido","zip":"420-717","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.49889,"lon":126.78306}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6572","name":"Deglutition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6280","name":"Cough","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4202","name":"Oculocerebral Syndrome With Hypopigmentation","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC09","name":"Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
