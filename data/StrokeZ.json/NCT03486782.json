Simultaneous dual site-dual channel stimulation was applied by using two sets of transcranial direct current stimulation devices. All subjects will go through four conditions of transcranial direct current stimulation with for 30 minutes. Four conditions are 1) Dual stimulation: i) anodal stimulation on ipsilesional inferior frontal cortex, ii) anodal stimulation on ipsilesional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 2) Single stimulation 1: anodal stimulation on ipsilesional inferior frontal cortex and cathodal stimulation on contralesional inferior frontal cortex; 3) Single stimulation 2: anodal stimulation on ipsilesional inferior frontal cortex and cathodal stimulation on contralesional supraorbital area."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia","Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["transcranial direct current
