By comparing kinematic analysis between stroke and healthy subjects in various directions, this investigation analyzes the compensatory kinematic movement for reaching task in stroke survivors","detailedDescription":"After Institutional Review Board approval, It recruits 2 groups. one group is elderly and another group is stroke survivors. the stroke group that meets the criteria. Another group is age matching of the stroke and not having an orthopedic or neurological disease. Participants of all the groups are assessed for kinematic by motion capture During reaching arm(affected side; stroke group, non-dominant side; healthy group) in 3 directions(medial_45, forward_90 and lateral_135 degrees). Retroreflective markers are placed on 11 anatomical place (3th metacarpal joint, both acromion, elbow lateral and medial epicondyle, lateral and medial styloid process, xyphoid process, sternum, C7, T4). Participants reach to a bell as quickly as possible in three directions. The subject reach to a bell 5 times in each direction and assess clinical evaluation such as Fugl Meyer Assessment, Postural Assessment Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, shoulder-elbow range of motion and Trunk Instability scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke","Hemiplegia, Spastic"],"keywords":["Chronic stroke","Reaching task","Motion capture"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":96,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"chronic stroke","description":"The subject consisted of the physician's confirmation of chronic hemiplegia onset ≥ 6 months Mini-mental state examination≥25 Biceps ≤2, Triceps≤2 Ability to Sit on a chair alone FMA upper extremity score ≥ 21points, FMA upper extremity score ≤ 66 points The symptom is mild or moderate level (MAS≤2) and can sit alone.
