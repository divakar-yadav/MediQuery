Subjects will be randomized to either the CIMT or treadmill training only groups at the initial test. Following the initial test, individuals from the 2 groups will undergo intensive locomotor training. Training will be performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks with the training time for each visit set to 45 minutes as tolerated. Data collection will proceed until 36 subjects from 2 groups have been trained.","detailedDescription":"To determine the effect of constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) on locomotor function in individuals post stroke. In order to compare the effect of CIMT vs. treadmill training only on walking function in individuals post-stroke, a 6 week, single-blind, randomized training study will be conducted with three assessments of gait to determine the training effect. Subjects will be blocked by gait speed into slow (\\< 0.4 m/s) or fast (≥ 0.4 m/s) subgroups and randomized to either the CIMT or treadmill training only groups at the initial test. Following the initial test, individuals from the 2 groups will undergo intensive locomotor training.
