Several factors have been related to shoulder pain after stroke such as paralysis, restricted range of motion in the shoulder, spasticity, sensory abnormalities, but the relationship between these factors and pain was not discussed.\n\nThe aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of electroacupuncture in reducing upper limbs spasticity and shoulder pain in stroke patients, and to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) for stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Shoulder Pain in Hemiplegic Side After Stroke"],"keywords":["electroacupuncture","TENS","shoulder disorder","hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EA group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To acupuncture the Juanyu (Li15) \\& Jugu (Li16) with sensation of de-qi, and then give 50 Hz electrical stimulation for 20 minutes.","interventionNames":["Procedure: acupuncture"]},{"label":"TENS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The electrical patches were placed on the Juanyu (Li15) \\& Jugu (Li16) or Juanyu (Li15), Quchi (Li11), Shousanli (Li10) \\& Hegu (Li4), connected to a TENS apparatus and then give 50 Hz electrical stimulation for 20 minutes.","interventionNames":["Procedure: TENS"]},{"label":"sham-acupuncutre","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The Park's Sham Device were placed on the Juanyu (Li15) \\& Jugu (Li16).","interventionNames":["Procedure: sham acupuncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"acupuncture","description":"All participants were received regular rehabilitation program, and received different interventions.\n\ntreatment frequency: 20 minutes per session, once daily, 5 times a week for 2 weeks","armGroupLabels":["EA group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"TENS","armGroupLabels":["TENS group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"sham acupuncture","armGroupLabels":["sham-acupuncutre"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"shoulder pain degrees","description":"pain VAS in passive shoulder ROM","timeFrame":"10 days after first intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"shoulder ROM","description":"passive shoulder ROM (abduction, ER)","timeFrame":"10 days after first intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke within 6 months from onset\n* Hemiplegia with shoulder pain (VAS \\> 2)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* previous pathology of the shoulder or cardiac pacemaker, and cognition problems","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Tasen Wei","affiliation":"Physical Medical and Rehabilitation, Changhua Christian Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Changhua Christian Hospital","city":"Taiwan","state":"Changhua","zip":"500","country":"Taiwan"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020069","term":"Shoulder Pain"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000018771","term":"Arthralgia"},{"id":"D000007592","term":"Joint Diseases"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000010146","term":"Pain"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21597","name":"Shoulder Pain","asFound":"Shoulder Pain","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12756","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20523","name":"Arthralgia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10311","name":"Joint Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11787","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
