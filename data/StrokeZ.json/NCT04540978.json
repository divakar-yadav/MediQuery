Early mobilization and early rehabilitation are the means to achieve activity at the early phase post-stroke. Performance of out-of-bed activity at an acute care setting is partially dependent on the routines used in the acute care setting, however, knowledge the knowledge about associations between clinical routines and the characteristics of out-of-bed activity is limited. Also, there is limited knowledge about institutional barriers to such activity.\n\nAccordingly, the goal of the current study is, in acute hospital inpatient setting, to: 1) characterize stroke patients' activity according to shifts (i.e. morning and evening), 2) test associations between out-of-bed activity and patients' clinical status and 3) identify barriers to activity.\n\nThe study is a prospective observational study that monitors physical activity in people after stroke while they in an acute stroke care setting, and records berries for out-of-bed activity including being in sitting or standing and walking.\n\nPatients are included if they admitted to the hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset, passed routine initial neurologic and nursing examinations within 48 hours of admission, and have score of 5-18 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Patients are excluded if they had hemorrhagic stroke, and if they have heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, unstable hemodynamics and fractures, or if they are terminally ill.","detailedDescription":"Not required"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time in sitting according to shift (i.e. morning or evening).","description":"Body position is measured by activity monitor located at the lumbar spine.","timeFrame":"Two weeks from admission or or until discharge."},{"measure":"Number of steps according to shift (i.e. morning or evening).","description":"Number of steps is recorded by activity monitor located at the lumbar spine.","timeFrame":"Two weeks from admission or or until discharge."},{"measure":"Barriers for getting out of bed.","description":"Barriers are documented daily in a follow-up table.","timeFrame":"Two weeks from admission or or until discharge."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Longest sitting time according to shift (i.e. morning or evening).","description":"Body position is measured by activity monitor located at the lumbar spine.","timeFrame":"Two weeks from admission or or until discharge."},{"measure":"Longest walking time according to shift (i.e. morning or evening).","description":"Walking time is recorded by activity monitor located at the lumbar spine.","timeFrame":"Two weeks from admission or or until discharge."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke\n* Admitted to the hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset\n* Passed routine initial neurologic and nursing examinations within 48 hours of admission\n* Score of 5-18 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hemorrhagic stroke\n* Heart failure\n* Unstable hemodynamics\n* Fractures\n* Terminally ill","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients after ischemic stroke who are admitted to Neurological department, and who are having mild-moderate stroke-related symptoms.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Michal Kafri, PhD","affiliation":"University of Haifa","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Tel Aviv Souraski Medical Center, Neurology Department","city":"Tel Aviv","country":"Israel","geoPoint":{"lat":32.08088,"lon":34.78057}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
