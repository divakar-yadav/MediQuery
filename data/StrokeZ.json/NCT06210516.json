The most common disorders that occur after stroke are motor disorders. In addition, these patients may be accompanied by respiratory problems such as changes in breathing patterns and decreased ventilation function. Respiratory problems are an important risk factor for the development of long-term mortality for both cardiovascular diseases and stroke. With all these changes, there is a serious decrease in the activity performance of the patients. While stroke rehabilitation focuses on motor function losses, problems in pulmonary functions do not receive the necessary attention. Evaluating and treating patients from every aspect in stroke rehabilitation will further increase the effectiveness of the treatments applied.\n\nUltrasonography (USG), which has been used in the field of healthcare for more than 40 years, works with a mechanism based on the principle of sound waves traveling and reflecting at different speeds in tissues of different densities. USG is a very useful and effective imaging method used by modern medicine as a part of examination and patient care, based on its advantages such as sound waves being harmless to living beings because they are non-ionizing, the image being real-time and being viewable at the time of the procedure, being a non-invasive method, and being inexpensive. This study will be included in the literature as an original study in terms of examining both the development of the patients and the effectiveness of the treatment in many aspects, with many parameters obtained by ultrasonography in subacute stroke patients who will receive respiratory muscle training.","detailedDescription":"According to WHO, stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident, is a neurological condition that results in rapidly developing loss of brain function as a result of a problem in the blood supply to the brain. Stroke, which ranks third among the causes of death, is one of the leading causes of disability. This neurological condition affects not only the periphery but also the respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, causing respiratory weakness, changes in breathing patterns, and a decrease in respiratory volume. These changes in breathing lead to a decrease in physical activity and therefore limitation in daily living activities. The decrease in respiratory muscle strength results in an increase in morbidity and mortality due to decreased pulmonary function.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the most common non-pharmacological treatment method for pulmonary diseases. PR has been studied extensively in patients with neuromuscular disease or spinal cord injury patients with restrictive pulmonary disease; However, studies in stroke patients with respiratory complications such as pneumonia are limited.\n\nThere are studies in the literature showing that respiratory muscle training applied after stroke has positive effects on various respiratory parameters.\n\nIn this study, the development of the pulmonary muscles with respiratory muscle training after stroke will be followed by ultrasound and functional tests, and the effect of this development on hand grip strength and activity performance, which is an indicator of general muscle strength, will be examined."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subacute Stroke","Inspiratory Muscle Training"],"keywords":["Subacute Stroke","Ischemic","Respiratory Muscle Training","Ultrasonography","Activity Performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A Randomised-controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single-blind","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Inspiratory muscle training, aerobic training, breathing exercises neurophysiologic rehabilitation will be applied to the experimental group.
