The effect of specialized CBCR is compared to completing generally cognitively stimulating activities on a computer. A total of 600 patients (400 with stroke, 100 after heart attack and 100 with Parkinson's disease) is expected to be enrolled. All patients will complete a neuropsychological test battery assessing executive functions at inclusion, directly after the eight-week training period and at follow-up three months after the end of the intervention period. Furthermore, all patients will answer questionnaires concerning quality of life and ADL-measures at baseline, after the intervention and at follow-up. All patients will train for a period of 8 weeks, 5 times a week for 60 minutes regardless of their group allocation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Stroke","Cardiac Arrest","Cognitive Dysfunction","Executive Dysfunction"],"keywords":["parkinson disease","stroke","cardiac arrest","executive dysfunction","cognitive dysfunction","computer-based cognitive rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two parallel groups will be included in this study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Because of the nature of the intervention, masking participants and investigators is not possible.
