The period of participation for each child is 12 months. The Immediate Group will have 3 months of intervention and 9 months follow-up. The Delay Group will be followed for 6 months (waitlist-control period), then given the opportunity to receive the same intervention and followed for 3 months after the intervention.\n\nThe intervention will be delivered by clinicians in the rehabilitation centres in partnership with the child's parents. Therapists will provide training 2 days a week and will coach the parents to provide the training at home for 2 days a week.\n\nThe intervention is ELEVATE (Engaging the Lower Extremity Via Active Therapy Early) and consists of child-initiated, intensive leg activities for one hour a day, four days a week for 12 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Perinatal Stroke"],"keywords":["Walking","Intensive exercise","Rehabilitation","Cerebral Palsy","Early intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessing therapists are masked to the child's group assignment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Immediate Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention is intensive exercise, delivered over 12 weeks beginning on admission to the study.
