Post-stroke spasticity along with weakness and lack of coordination result in gait abnormalities and functional limitations. Recent treatment option include neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES), a form of therapy that applies electrical currents to produce contraction of innervated muscle by depolarizing local motor nerves. Currently, there are wide varieties of NMES devices available commercially for consumer.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based NMES program on lower limb spasticity in patient with post-stroke more than 6 months and to assess the impact of the program. This is single arm prospective intervention study. Patient will apply home-based NMES on their leg for 20 minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, an outcome measures will be assessed and patient will be required to answer a questionnaires on their experience."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based NMES program on lower limb spasticity in patient with post-stroke","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home-based Electrical Stimulation Program for lower limb spasticity","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single arm prospective intervention study to assess the feasibility and impact of a home-based program.
