Whereas prognosis and antithrombotic treatment in older patients with cardiovascular disease are among the best studied topics in clinical medicine, this does not hold true for patients at young age. It is of great importance to treat these patient groups correctly to prevent recurrence and bleeding complications. However, previous research have shown that there is a long-term increased risk of recurrent ischemic events despite the secondary prevention and a subsequent increased bleeding risk. To tailor effective antithrombotic therapy to the individual patient, it is essential to understand the underlying pathogenesis and identify modifiable risk factors in young patients for recurrence or bleeding. It is thought that abnormalities of hemostasis may play a key role in early-onset ischemic stroke. First, prothrombotic conditions are associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke at young age. In addition, disturbance of the hemostatic balance due to one or several triggers can activate the coagulation cascade, which on its turn can lead or contribute to clot formation and subsequent arterial occlusion. In previous study, there were indications that trigger factors such as fever and/or an infection in the days prior to the stroke may play a role in the pathogenesis. This suggests that an interaction between inflammation, endothelial damage and coagulation may lead to the formation of a clot. In this observational study we aim to investigate the role of the immune system, endothelial damage and coagulation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of stroke in young patients.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of hemostasis, inflammation and endothelial activation in the etiology and prognosis in an acute ischemic stroke (or TIA) in young stroke patients.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: Multicentre prospective observational study\n\nSTUDY POPULATION:\n\nAll patients aged between 18 and 50 years old with a first-ever ischemic stroke or TIA who are admitted to the neurology ward or seen at the outpatient clinic of one of the participating centers.\n\nMain exclusion criteria are: history of clinical TIA, ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. A intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from trauma, known aneurysm or underlying intracerebral malignancy. A venous infarction, retinal infarction and amourosis fugax. Inadequate control of the Dutch language to reliably sign an informed consent from and/or participate in the follow-up. Patients are excluded if they have a contra indication for 3T MRI.\n\nIn addition 60 healthy controls (18-50 years old) will be included.\n\nMAIN STUDY ENDPOINTS:\n\n1. Baseline and 3 months coagulation profile:\n\n   Whole blood and platelet poor plasma thrombin generation, platelet function tests, and coagulation biomarkers, screening for thrombophilia.\n2. Baseline and 3 months inflammation/endothelial activation profile:\n\n   Cytokines/chemokines, expression of receptors/cofactors related to hemostasis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), stimulation tests of PBMC's to assess trained immunity.\n3. Vessel wall enhancement on 3 Tesla MRI\n4. Questionnaire trigger factors"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Stroke in the Young","Cardiovascular Diseases","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Embolism and Thrombosis","Thrombophilia","Coagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Patients and controls at baseline:\n\n1 x 2.7 mL + 1 x 9ml sodium citrate tube, aliquoted in 4 x 1000 µL cryovials;\n\n1 x 5 mL serum tube, aliquoted in 3 x 500 µL sterile cryovials;\n\n1 x 3 mL EDTA tube, aliquoted in 3 x 500 µL cryovials;\n\nFor 20 patients and 20 controls from the Radboudumc the following tubes were addionally collected for whole blood analysis:\n\n1x 2.7 ml citrate tube 3 x 10 ml EDTA tube for PBMCs isolation and storage.\n\nPatients at 3-month visit:\n\n1 x 2.7 mL + 1 x 9ml sodium citrate tube, aliquoted in 4 x 1000 µL cryovials;\n\n1 x 5 mL serum tube, aliquoted in 3 x 500 µL sterile cryovials;\n\n1 x 3 mL EDTA tube, aliquoted in 3 x 500 µL cryovials;\n\nFor 20 patients and 20 controls from the Radboudumc the following tubes were addionally collected for whole blood analysis:\n\n1x 2.7 ml citrate tube 3 x 10 ml EDTA tube for PBMCs isolation and storage."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":280,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke at young age (18-50 years)","description":"Patients aged 18 to 50 years with first-ever ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack."},{"label":"Healthy controls","description":"Healthy controls (aged 18 to 50 years) without cardiovascular diseases in their medical history.
