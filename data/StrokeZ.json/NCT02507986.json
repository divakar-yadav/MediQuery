A stroke is called \"cryptogenic\" if no cause can be determined after standard work-up. Current detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after stroke is 2.0%. Recent studies revealed that prolonged monitoring yields higher percentages of detected AF (12.0%). Devices used in these trials suffer from drawbacks. The investigators' hypothesis is that a new, smartphone compatible device, producing a single lead ECG (single lead ECG device), can be used for prolonged ECG monitoring in cryptogenic stroke patients.\n\nObjective: The main objective of this study is to compare the incidence of detected AF in cryptogenic stroke patients by a single lead ECG device with the incidence of detected AF by a 7-Day Holter ECG.\n\nStudy design: A multicenter randomized trial. Study population: Cryptogenic stroke patients admitted to a hospital participating in the study. The calculated sample size is 200 (100 per arm).\n\nIntervention: After inclusion, patients will be randomized to either a single lead ECG device or a 7-Day Holter Monitor.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint will be the percentage of detected atrial fibrillation in both the single lead ECG device group and the 7-Day Holter group after one year.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Both devices are battery powered and electrically safe. Patients face a 2-3% risk that AF is detected false-positively; this might lead to incorrect oral anticoagulation (OAC) prescription. However, a potential benefit of the investigators' study is that if AF is detected and treated with OAC, this significantly reduces the chance of recurrent stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"7-Day Holter monitor","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This arm will receive a 7-Day Holter monitor directly after randomization.","interventionNames":["Device: 7-Day Holter monitor."]},{"label":"Single lead ECG device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This arm will be asked to take a single lead ECG two times per day and in case of complaints with a single lead ECG device.","interventionNames":["Device: Single lead ECG device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Single lead ECG device","description":"The single lead ECG device is a smartphone compatible handheld device that produces a single lead ECG after 30 seconds of measurement.
