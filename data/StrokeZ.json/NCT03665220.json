When the resulting condition has become established, treatment should take the form of a mixed intervention model, incorporating preventive, rehabilitational and compensatory or adaptive approaches, aimed at enhancing the patient's performance within the environment. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are key disciplines in the composition of multi- and inter-disciplinary teams for the care of stroke patients. In this clinical trial we evaluate the effectiveness of two programmes of ergonomic intervention in the home, with respect to levels of functionality (performance of activities of daily living) and the quality of life of post-stroke patients, by reference to a control group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Quality of Life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ergonomic adjustment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ergonomic intervention program at home for post-stroke patients.
