Specific Aims:\n\n1. There is one specific aim of this study. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of early standardized task-specific training (ESTT) in persons with acute stroke.\n\nB. Hypothesis:\n\n1. It is our hypothesis that subjects who receive ESTT will walk faster and more symmetrically than published reports of gait outcomes in persons with stroke.","detailedDescription":"It is our contention that gait recovery after stroke is impacted by the interventions that are acutely utilized during training. There is not a consensus about how to most effectively train individuals after stroke. It is clear, however, that most persons are left with significant and often debilitating gait dysfunction after stroke so there is an urgent need to find more effective therapeutic methods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","gait","acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"early standardized task training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Persons in the experimental group will receive ESTT (early standardized task specific training) for gait treatment after stroke.","interventionNames":["Other: Early standardized task training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Early standardized task training","description":"Early standardized task training is a treatment approach using treadmill training applied very early after stroke onset.","armGroupLabels":["early standardized task training"],"otherNames":["ESTT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Walking Velocity From Initial Assessment to Completion of Study at 6 Months Post Enrollment","description":"Computerized gait analysis is done by a mat system (GAITRite) that electronically calculates the velocity.","timeFrame":"This will be done at the time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation (the initial assessment point of the study) and at 6-months post enrollment."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Score on Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM) Test From Initial Assessment to Discharge From Study.","description":"The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM) is a test of motor recovery after stroke.
