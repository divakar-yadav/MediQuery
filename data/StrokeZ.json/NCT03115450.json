Patients that have either an external ventricular drain (EVD) or bolt placed will be enrolled in the study. After the EVD and bolt are placed the patient will undergo pupilometer examination (standard of care) followed by ultrasound assessment of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). The three values will be recorded. The same patient may have multiple readings performed if there is a change in ICP either spontaneously or due to intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Hemorrhages","Brain Injuries","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Ischemic Stroke","Stroke"],"keywords":["External ventricular drain (EVD)","Placement of Bolt"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Ultrasound","description":"Type of imaging technology to look at organs and structures inside the body"},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Pupilometer","description":"A device that measures pupil size and how it changes."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter (ONSD) and corresponding intracranial pressure (ICP).","description":"Analysis of varying ONSD and pupillometer readings to concurrent ICP","timeFrame":"1 day of ONSD examination"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of Pupillometer reading and corresponding intracranial pressure (ICP).","description":"Comparison of Neurological Pupil index (NPi) in both eye and concurrent ICP","timeFrame":"1 day per nursing protocol (standard of care)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years old\n* Intracranial pathology requiring either EVD or bolt placement for ICP measurement\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known disorder of lens or orbit including but not limited to glaucoma, cataract, blindness, lens implants.\n* Patients unable to close eyelids as this would increase risk of corneal abrasion from ultrasound probe.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adults that have intracranial pathology requiring either EVD or bolt placement for measuring ICP.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Loma Linda University Medical Center","city":"Loma Linda","state":"California","zip":"92354","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":34.04835,"lon":-117.26115}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21748035","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Chen JW, Gombart ZJ, Rogers S, Gardiner SK, Cecil S, Bullock RM.
