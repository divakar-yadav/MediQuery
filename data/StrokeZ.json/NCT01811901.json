This delay can be dissected into onset-to-door time and door-to-needle time (DNT). Of the two, DNT can be directly influenced within the hospital by stream-lining of acute stroke care. The aim of our study is to reduce in-hospital delays (DNT) in self-selecting centers recruiting patients into the the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR) , comprising currently more than 80 000 patients from 1338 centers. Current median of DNT in all SITS centers is 65 minutes (compared with 20 minutes in Helsinki Univer-sity Central Hospital). An itemized detailed questionnaire, including all factors known to influence DNT, has been sent to all SITS centers to identify the reasons for long in-hospital delays. Based on the replies, we have prepared a list of interventions that can be considered by individual SITS centers in order to reduce DNT with interventions that are in line with national legislation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["inhospital delays, door-to-needle time, thrombolysis, acute ischemic stroke, SITS, SITS-WATCH, stroke registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group (SITS-WATCH centers)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"15-item list of suggested interventions aiming to reduce DNT sent to SITS-WATCH centers.","interventionNames":["Other: Reduction of DTN"]},{"label":"Control group (non SITS-WATCH centers in SITS registry)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Centres that do not use 15-item list of suggested interventions aiming to reduce DNT."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Reduction of DTN","description":"15-item list of suggested interventions aiming to reduce DNT sent to SITS-WATCH centers.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group (SITS-WATCH centers)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Absolute DNT reduction of at least 20 minutes or at least 20% change in SITS-WATCH centers that completed the whole study period","description":"DNT will be evaluated at regular intervals (twice a year).","timeFrame":"January 2013-December 2014"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Significantly larger reduction of DNT in SITS-WATCH centers compared with non-SITS-WATCH centers in SITS.","description":"Proportion of centers with median DNT below 40 minutes.
