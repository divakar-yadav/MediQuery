All participants will be randomized into two groups: AB and BA. They will all exercise at least 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a minimal 3 hours exercise time per week. Participants will receive the other intervention at 3-month post stroke date. Clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline, post therapy after first intervention, 3-week post intervention follow up, 3-month post stroke, post therapy after second intervention, 3-week post second intervention follow up, and 6-month post stroke follow up visits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Music Glove","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Music Glove is a glove with sensors attached to the tips of all 5 fingers.
