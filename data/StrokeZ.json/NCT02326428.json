At early time, within the first 4,5 hours, the conventional treatment is to try to dissolve this blood clot with a medication (\"thrombolytic drug\") which is administered to the blood through the needle in the vein. If the clot still remains there, additional treatment is possible - going directly to the clot via artery and taking it out with a special device. Patients may be included even if they are not treated with intravenous thrombolysis because of contraindication or other reasons. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the benefit and safety efficacy of thrombectomy and standard stroke care in clinical routine treatment of acute occlusive stroke compared to standard stroke care only."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Brain ischemia","Intravenous thrombolysis","Stroke thrombectomy","Stent-retriever"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":341,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Thrombectomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Thrombectomy arm consists of patients undergoing thrombectomy according to accepted critera in the judgement of investigator.
