Regaining independence in standing and walking is of utmost importance for patients recovering from stroke. Walking balance requires muscles in the legs and trunk to contract quickly if people lose their balance. Physical therapy plays a key role in the rehabilitation of walking balance in individuals after stroke. Given that maintaining one's balance requires fast muscle activity, rehabilitation post-stroke should focus on speed of movement. Thus we are proposing to compare a program that emphasizes speed of movement, Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training versus an active control (usual care)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Physical Therapy","Exercise therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The usual care will consist of strength training, endurance, range of motion, patient education, weight shifting in standing and gait re-training.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Usual Care"]},{"label":"FAST protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Fast muscle activation and stepping training will be the Experimental arm of this trial.
