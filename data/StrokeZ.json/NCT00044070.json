The study will determine if a 24-hour infusion of YM872, given within 6 hours of stroke onset, reduces the ischemic lesion volume as measured by MRI at 28 days after the infusion is given. The clinical effects of YM872 will also be determined by neurological function and disability scores at follow up visits through Day 90 of the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["ARTIST","Acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"YM872 (zonampanel)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have suffered an acute ischemic stroke and can be evaluated and treatment initiated within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms (Onset is defined as the time that which the patient was last seen in a normal state, or bedtime for unwitnessed strokes occurring during the night).\n* Patients who have a three dimensionally measurable lesion compatible with an acute ischemic stroke measured using MRI.\n* Patients who have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 7 but not more than 23 and who are conscious.\n* Patients who are able to provide written informed consent or have consent provided by a legally authorized representative.\n* Patients who are at least 18 years of age.\n* Other criteria as specified in the study protocol\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have received alteplase (t-PA) for the current stroke episode.
