Our observations in the BASICS registry underscore that we continue to lack a proven treatment modality for patients with an acute BAO and that current clinical practice varies widely. Furthermore, the often-held assumption that intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) is superior to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with an acute symptomatic BAO is challenged by our data. The BASICS registry was observational and has all the limitations of a non-randomised study. Interpretation of results is hampered by the lack of a standard treatment protocol for all patients who entered the study.\n\nObjective: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAT in addition to best medical management (BMM) in patients with basilar artery occlusion.\n\nStudy design: Randomised, multi-centre, open label, controlled phase III, treatment trial.\n\nStudy population: Patients, aged 18 years and older, with CTA or MRA confirmed basilar occlusion.\n\nIntervention: Patients will be randomised between BMM with additional IAT versus BMM alone. IAT has to be initiated within 6 hours from estimated time of BAO. If treated with as part of BMM, IVT should be started within 4.5 hours of estimated time of BAO.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Favorable outcome at day 90 defined as a modified Rankin Score (mRS - functional scale) of 0-3."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Thrombosis","Basilar Artery Embolism","Stroke of Basilar Artery","Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["basilar","stroke","mechanical","thrombolysis","intra-arterial","trombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":282,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Best medical management.","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Best medical management consists of the standard of care of patients with acute ischemic stroke according to existing local protocols and guidelines, and may include IV thrombolysis.\n\nIf treated with IVT as part of BMM, IVT should be started within 4.5 hours of estimated time of BAO."},{"label":"Additional intra-arterial treatment.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Best medical management followed by intra-arterial treatment and best medical management","interventionNames":["Other: Intra-arterial treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intra-arterial treatment","description":"IA therapy has to be initiated within 6 hours of estimated time of basilar artery occlusion.
