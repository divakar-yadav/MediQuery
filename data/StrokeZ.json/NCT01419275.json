Robust collateral flow can improve response to thrombolytic therapy and decrease the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Despite their central importance, collaterals during acute stroke are poorly understood, largely because assessment has required an invasive imaging test, cerebral angiography. This proposal assesses whether a noncontrast MRI perfusion technique, called arterial spin labeling (ASL), can yield important information about collateral flow."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Moyamoya Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Moyamoya","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Approximately 60 Moyamoya patients will be enrolled, and will receive arterial spin label MRI with Xenon contrast agent to assess collateral blood flow.","interventionNames":["Drug: Xenon contrast agent","Device: Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},{"label":"Acute stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Approximately 60 acute stroke patients will be enrolled, and will receive arterial spin label MRI with Xenon contrast agent to assess collateral blood flow.","interventionNames":["Drug: Xenon contrast agent","Device: Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},{"label":"Healthy participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Approximately 30 healthy participants will be enrolled, and will receive arterial spin label MRI with Xenon contrast agent to assess collateral blood flow.","interventionNames":["Drug: Xenon contrast agent","Device: Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},{"label":"Diagnosis unspecified","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Approximately 60 participants with diagnosis unspecified will be enrolled, and will receive arterial spin label MRI with Xenon contrast agent to assess collateral blood flow.","interventionNames":["Drug: Xenon contrast agent","Device: Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Xenon contrast agent","armGroupLabels":["Acute stroke","Diagnosis unspecified","Healthy participants","Moyamoya"],"otherNames":["XeMED contrast agent"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","description":"Arterial spin label sequence for the purpose of measuring collateral flow","armGroupLabels":["Acute stroke","Diagnosis unspecified","Healthy participants","Moyamoya"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Regions With Collateral Versus Antegrade Blood Flow (Sensitivity) Correctly Identified Using MRI With Xenon Contrast Agent (Specificity)","description":"Sensitivity and specificity for MRI-based ASL measure of presence of collaterals was measured using digital subtraction angiography as a gold standard.
