Combined electrical stimulation with exercises for 6 weeks would lead to earlier and greater improvement in motor functions when compared with placebo-stimulation with exercises.","detailedDescription":"Previous studies have shown that repeated sensory inputs from transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) could enhance brain plasticity and conical motor output. Home-based rehabilitation is shown to be effective in motor recovery and improvement of functional ability in stroke rehabilitation.\n\nThe aim of this study was to develop a home-based rehabilitation program to investigate whether combined electrically induced sensory inputs through TES with task-related trunk training (TRTT) in a home-based program would induce earlier and/or greater improvement in, seated reaching distance and trunk control when compared with placebo TES and TRTT, or control with no active treatment in subjects with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Sitting balance","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"electrical stimulation with exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The TENS + TRTT group received TENS simultaneously with the TRTT at home under the instruction of a physical therapist.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: electrical stimulation with exercises"]},{"label":"placebo stimulation with exercises","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The TENS + TRTT group received placebo-simultaneously with the TRTT at home under the instruction of a physical therapist.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: placebo stimulation with exercises"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects in this group did not receive any active training.
