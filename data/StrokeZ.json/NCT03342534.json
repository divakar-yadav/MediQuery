Physical therapies can improve the autonomy of these patients, but despite an intensive stationary neurorehabilitation, severe deficits often persist. Complementary therapies that could improve recovery would therefore be very welcome.\n\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces, in a non-invasive way, a transient inhibitory or excitatory neuromodulation of certain cerebral regions. An increasing number of studies show that this modulation of brain activity can improve motor functions in patients with brain lesions and increase the effect of physical therapies. However, the \"optimum\" configuration of tDCS and the induced effects remain to be characterized and investigated.\n\nThe investigators therefore propose to carry out a study including a pilot phase in order to determine the most efficient tDCS setup. The optimum setup of of the pilot phase will be compared to a placebo condition in a multicentric main study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The anode is placed over the primary motor cortex of the stroke affected hemisphere, the cathode over the contralesional supraorbital front of the patient.","interventionNames":["Device: DC-stimulator (Neuroconn, Germany)"]},{"label":"High definition (HD) anodal tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A single HD anode is placed over the primary motor cortex of the stroke affected hemisphere, 4 HD cathodes are placed over the affected hemisphere around the anode.","interventionNames":["Device: DC-stimulator (Neuroconn, Germany)"]},{"label":"Bihemispheric tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The anode is placed over the primary motor cortex of the stroke affected hemisphere, the cathode over the primary motor cortex of the contralesional hemisphere.","interventionNames":["Device: DC-stimulator (Neuroconn, Germany)"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The electrodes are placed as in one of the active arms, but only a ramp up current is applied during 30 seconds and then switched off.
