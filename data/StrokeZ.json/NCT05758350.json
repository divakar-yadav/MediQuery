Among them, the strength of tongue and lip muscles played a key role in the oral phase of swallowing and many stroke survivors suffered from these muscles weakness. Iowa oral performance instrument (IOPI) is a standardized portable device that can be used to quantify tongue muscle strength, thus allowing the clinician to set the level of resistance necessary to achieve optimal gains in strength, and also providing visual feedback of performance to the patients to guide training. In this study, we use Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) to screen for the stroke patient suffering from dysphagia and recruited them into the trial. They then participated in a home based resistance-training program using the tongue depressor, 1 time everyday and each time consisted of 30 repetitions, totally 4 weeks. Various tongue strength variables and subjective scale were obtained before and after the intervention. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of the home based swallowing therapy in the post stroke dysphagia patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia Following Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["dysphagia","ischemic stroke","intracranial hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Including conventional speech therapy (tongue range of motion and strength, oral diet suggestion, masseter muscle strengthening) and home- IOPI based resistance training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: home based IOPI swallow training"]},{"label":"controlled group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Including conventional speech therapy (tongue range of motion and strength, oral diet suggestion, masseter muscle strengthening) only"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"home based IOPI swallow training","description":"Use IOPI for tongue and labial muscle resistance training.
