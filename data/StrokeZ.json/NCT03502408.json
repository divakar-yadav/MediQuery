According to patients or their family members' willing, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to endovascular thrombectomy group with approved devices (only the devices listed in this protocol are approved for us) plus standard medical therapy or control group (standard medical therapy alone) after undergoing either CT Perfusion or MR Perfusion studies. Patients who have evidence of an ICA or MCA M1 or M2 or BA occlusion and a Target Mismatch Profile will be enrolled.\n\nThe intent of this study is to support thrombectomy beyond the currently labeled 8 hour indicated time limit in wake up, unclear onset, and late presenting ischemic stroke subjects, who currently have no other option besides medical management of their symptoms, with careful selection.\n\nThe study will enroll up to 55 patients. The primary endpoint, the modified Rankin Score, will be assessed at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular Thrombectomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Procedure: Endovascular Thrombectomy Device: Trepo trevor Retriever Device: Solitaire™ FR Revascularization Device","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular Thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular Thrombectomy","description":"Procedure: Endovascular Thrombectomy Device: Trepo trevor Retriever Device: Solitaire™ FR Revascularization Device","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular Thrombectomy"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular Thrombectomy","description":"Procedure:Endovascular Thrombectomy Device: Solitaire™ FR Revascularization Device","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular Thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Good Functional Independence","description":"This outcome will look at the proportion of patients with mRS 0-2 at day 90.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death","description":"Death","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage","description":"Defined as NIHSS worsening of 4 or more points associated with ICH within 24 hours of randomization","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nClinical Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
