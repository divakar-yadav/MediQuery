We use electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve innervating the rectus femoris for a well-controlled reflex stimulus. We are investigating whether reflex excitability of the rectus femoris correlates with gait kinematics.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of hyperreflexia in post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait function.
