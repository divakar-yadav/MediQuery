The North Kynouria Study was initiated to assess modifiable and non-modifiable determinants of cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease.","detailedDescription":"BACKGROUND:\n\nThe North Kynouria Project is a longitudinal, interventional-behavioural, prospective study aiming to identify cardiovascular/stroke risk factors, in the adult population of the municipality of North Kynouria, in the county of Arcadia, Peloponnese, Greece. The project, initiated in November 2022, recruits volunteers, of both sexes, over 18 years of age, irrespective of their personal history of cardiovascular disease. The epidemiology and burden of cardiovascular disease in North Kynouria remain unknown. The study aims to explore and document the prevalence of major cardiovascular/stroke risk factors, as well as the nutritional status, cigarette smoking, exercise habits, alcohol consumption, and overall quality of life of the inhabitants.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nThe screening exam is conducted at the Astros, Health Center, by obtaining the patient's personal history, and information about the patient's habits, such as physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Body weight, height, and waist-to-hip ratio are also measured. During the examination, blood pressure is evaluated using a pre-specified protocol, including assessment of orthostatic hypertension. Further testing includes electrocardiography, ankle-brachial index, direct ophthalmoscopy, and carotid and cardiac ultrasound. Blood samples are collected and stored at the deep freeze of the Astros premises, and blood count, lipid panel, and liver and kidney function are measured.\n\nThe main field of interest is the prevalence and burden of risk factors and cardiovascular disease in the wider region of North Kynouria, Arcadia Greece. The project aims to assess the epidemiology of CVD and consequently improve public health and engage with the local community through healthy behavioral education."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Cerebrovascular Disease","Coronary Disease","Dyslipidemias","Stroke (CVA) or TIA","Myocardial
