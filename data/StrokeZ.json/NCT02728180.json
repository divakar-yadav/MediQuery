The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Xingnaojing will increase the proportion of people alive and independent at three months. Xingnaojing, combined with guidelines-based standard care, will be compared to standard care alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset. All patients will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) entry score of 5-20. Patients in each group will be treated according to the guidelines-based standard care, including intravenous thrombolysis if appropriate. The primary outcome will be determined at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Xingnaojing injection","Randomized Controlled Trial","Traditional Chinese Medicine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":720,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Xingnaojing and standard care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive intravenously administered Xingnaojing injection, combined with guidelines-based standard care.","interventionNames":["Drug: Xingnaojing injection","Other: Standard care"]},{"label":"Standard care only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will receive guidelines-based standard care only.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Xingnaojing injection","description":"Xingnaojing injection (20 ml), IV (in the vein), every 12 hours for 10 days.","armGroupLabels":["Xingnaojing and standard care"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard care","description":"Guidelines-based standard care for acute ischemic stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Standard care only","Xingnaojing and standard care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients independent","description":"Proportion of patients independent is defined as Modified Rankin Scale score of 0, 1, or 2.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of the change in the NIHSS scores from baseline to 10 days in the two groups.","description":"The NIHSS score ranges from 0 (best score) to 42 (worst score).","timeFrame":"Baseline and 10 days."},{"measure":"Activities of daily living","description":"Activities of daily living measured by Barthel Index score at 30 days and 90 days.","timeFrame":"30 days and 90 days"},{"measure":"Patient reported outcome (PRO) scale of stroke","description":"Patient reported outcome (PRO) scale of stroke at 10 days.","timeFrame":"10 days"},{"measure":"Early neurologic deterioration (END)","description":"Early neurologic deterioration is defined as an increase of 3 points or more in the NIHSS score between baseline and 48 hours.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 48 hours"},{"measure":"Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (sICH) within 10 days of stroke onset.
