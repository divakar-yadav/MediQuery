Each task is scored from 0 (cannot perform independently) to 4 (stated best performance). 0-20 points are interpreted as high risk of falling, between 21-40 points as medium risk of falling, and between 41-56 points as low risk.

Those who score 26 and below are thought to have problems; It is observed that the risk of self-falling is five times higher in those who score 19 and below compared to normal individuals (17). Its adaptation to Turkish, validity and reliability study was carried out by Ağırcan in 2009.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Timed Up And Go Test","description":"Timed Up And Go Test is a simply and widely used and rapid test for assessing mobility and dinamic balance. The person is asked to stand up from the chair, walk 3 meters safely and at a normal pace, turn around, walk back, sit back on the chair, and the time is recorded in seconds (sec). The test is started with the patient's feet flat on the floor and arms resting on the armrest of the chair, and is performed in three repetitions and the best result is recorded. Walking longer than 12 seconds indicates a risk of falling.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Sufficient cognitive function for communication (Standardized Mini-Mental Test score\\> 24)\n* Not dependent on bed or wheelchair.
