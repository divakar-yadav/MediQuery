In the first day was performed assessment of the participants to obtain the following data: anamnesis, initial evaluation using the Ashwouth Scale, Barthel Index and Mini Mental State Examination, anthropometric data and pulmonary function using spirometry and respiratory muscle pressures.\n\nIntervention phase was performed in two different days, each day for only one PET techniques (VIS or BS), with a minimal wash-out period of one day according to the randomization sequence. Optoelectronic Pletysmography (OEP) was recorded during quite breathing at rest and during the execution of five maneuvers form each PET technique tested."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Incentive Spirometry","Breath Stacking","Optoelectronic Plethysmography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Incentive Spirometry","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The Incentive Spirometry was characterized by the use of the incentive spirometer volume, in which volunteer used a nasal clip and was instructed to inhale slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece of the equipment from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity.","interventionNames":["Other: Incentive Spirometry"]},{"label":"Breath Stacking","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Breath Stacking A mask was used with two one-way valves (inspiratory limb and expiratory limb), which was coupled to the patient's face allowing only inspiration, while the expiratory branch remained occluded for the individual only perform successive inspiratory efforts.","interventionNames":["Other: Breath Stacking"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Breath Stacking","description":"Breath Stacking A mask was used with two one-way valves (inspiratory limb and expiratory limb), which was coupled to the patient's face allowing only inspiration, while the expiratory branch remained occluded for the individual only perform successive inspiratory efforts.","armGroupLabels":["Breath Stacking"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Incentive Spirometry","description":"The Incentive Spirometry was characterized by the use of the incentive spirometer volume, in which volunteer used a nasal clip and was instructed to inhale slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece of the equipment from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity.","armGroupLabels":["Incentive Spirometry"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Volume of the chest wall and Thoraco-abdominal compartments (pulmonary rib cage, abdominal rib cage and abdomen)","description":"Total chest wall and in the Differents thoraco-abdominal compartments measured by Opto-electronic plethysmography (OEP)","timeFrame":"During assessment and intervention, on average for an hour"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ventilatory Pattern (minute ventilation, breathing frequency, inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), duty cycle (TI/TTOT), tidal volume, mean inspiratory flow, mean expiratory flow)","description":"From variations of Volume of the chest wall during breathing measured by Opto-electronic plethysmography (OEP)","timeFrame":"During assessment and intervention, on average for an hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:Subjects with right hemiparesis due to stroke for more than three months, of both genders, most than 20 years, with scores between 1 and 3 for Ashworth Scale for upper limb, up to 85 for Index score Barthel and minimum score of 18 on the Mini Mental State Examination.\n\n-\n\nExclusion Criteria: Facial paralysis, rheumatic or orthopedic diseases or deformities / abnormalities in the spine that could compromise the respiratory mechanics;
