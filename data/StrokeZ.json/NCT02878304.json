Improved prediction of recovery after stroke has broad implications for clinical decisions on the type, duration and goals of rehabilitation.\n\n100 consecutive patients with 1st ever stroke and upper limb hemi-paresis will be subject to imaging, at 4 weeks and 6 months, and behavioral assessments at 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after stroke. The imaging protocol includes anatomical sequences for lesion mapping, diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI for structural and functional connectivity analyses, respectively. Clinical hand function measures will be combined with novel validated methods to quantify spasticity,grip force control, sensory and bimanual function.\n\nProHand will provide insights into neural mechanisms related to recovery of hand function after stroke and enable enhanced prediction and development of targeted treatment trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Prognosis","Hand function","Rehabilitation","Spasticity","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and six months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Structural and functional connectivity measures; functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in NeuroFlexor(C) measures","description":"Quantitative measures of the neural and biomechanical components of the force resisting passive movement of ther wrist","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in modulation of gripforce: Visuomotor grip force tracking task","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Action Research Arm Test, ARAT","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Strength-Dexterity test","description":"Dexterous ability/quantification of precision in finger movements","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in grip force","description":"Dynamometry","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Assisting Hand Assessment, AHA","description":"Measures of the spontaneous use of the more affected hand in specific bimanual activities","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Box and Block Task, BBT","timeFrame":"From 4 weeks to 3 and 6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* first ever stroke and clinically diagnosed arm paresis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* incapability to give informed concent and/or understand and comply with instructions, other disorders that may affect hand function (e.g. other neurological conditions, arthritis), cerebellar lesions.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients are recruited at entry to a specialized sub-acute rehabilitation unit after first time stroke","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jeanette AM Plantin, PhD student","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0046709169232","email":"jeanette.plantin@ki.se"},{"name":"Påvel G Lindberg, Ass.
