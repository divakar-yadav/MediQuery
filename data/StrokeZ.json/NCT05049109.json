Descriptive statistics will characterize the randomized patients completing surveys and outcome assessments. The study will evaluate the primary clinical outcome (BP \\<140/90 mmHg) 90 days post-discharge as a function of treatment and adjusted for from baseline BP. Change from baseline BP will also be assessed as an outcome. Change in activity level and duration, as well as trends in sedentary time will be compared between arms, and pre- and post-intervention with visual tailored infographics in the intervention arm. Moderating effects of demographics will also be evaluated. Decisions regarding the pursuit of a subsequent trial will use the primary outcome, and analysis of all other measures will be hypothesis generating.","detailedDescription":"Hypertension is the single most modifiable risk factor for prevention of secondary stroke. However, blood pressure (BP) remains poorly controlled after a stroke in up to 55% of survivors. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with lack of support, low level of independence, poor medication adherence and limited self-efficacy. These barriers are compounded following stroke with limited access to outpatient care. Sedentary behavior prevalence after stroke is high in both inpatient and community settings. Addressing physical activity may be a simple strategy to help counter growing health concerns during the pandemic from social restrictions.\n\nPre-COVID, the investigator created TASC (Telehealth After Stroke Care), an interdisciplinary telehealth clinic inclusive of primary care, pharmacy, and stroke specialists to address complex post-acute transitions of care and improve BP control. However, BP monitoring alone at best has a modest impact on medication adherence and health behaviors. As telehealth services expand during the pandemic, there is greater incentivization to devise interventions that utilize remote care to foster effective self-management.\n\nImproving health behaviors through remote monitoring and patient tailored feedback in an integrated post-acute stroke care model has not been studied. Integrated TASC (iTASC) is a telehealth intervention inclusive of interdisciplinary care and remote technology including BP monitoring and tracked activity, supplemented by infographics tailored with the patient's own data, to enhance BP control and drive health behavior modification.\n\nIn this proof-of-concept trial, the investigator will compare early post-stroke BP management among post-acute stroke patients at discharge randomized to the iTASC intervention or usual care (primary care and stroke physician follow up without remote monitoring) with a primary outcome of BP control defined by the mean 24-hr BP at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Blood Pressure","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Post-stroke BP management","BP control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group X","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients who have had stroke and high blood pressure will participate in 5 telehealth visits, which will take place over 3 months.
