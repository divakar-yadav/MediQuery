According to the World Stroke Organization, stroke has become the second cause of death and disability worldwide. In the United States, every year, more than 795,000 people have a stroke. Given the large-scale challenges of curing stroke, prevention and treatments for stroke are much needed. Ischemic stroke is treatable in many patients if they have early access to viable treatments.\n\nThis trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial designed to assess the potential treatment benefits of using the Imperative Care 0.088\" Catheters in conjunction with the other devices in the Zoom Reperfusion System to restore blood flow in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusive disease. The Zoom Reperfusion System includes the Imperative Care 0.088\" Catheters, the Zoom Reperfusion Catheters (0.035\" to 0.071\" Catheters), Zoom Aspiration Tubing, and Zoom Aspiration Pump. The trial will assess reperfusion success using the mTICI scores in the absence of any rescue therapy, reperfusion time, first-pass success, and functional independence including a quality-of-life assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, thrombectomy, Zoom, aspiration, reperfusion, mRS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, multicenter, open-label with independent outcome assessments.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Reperfusion will be graded by an independent core lab that is not an enrolling investigational site.\n\nNeurological Outcome Assessors (NIHSS assessment): Neurological outcome assessors who will perform post-procedure 24-hour NIHSS assessments are NIHSS certified team members not performing the thrombectomy procedure and with no financial conflict of interest with Imperative Care, Inc.\n\nFunctional Outcome Assessors (mRS assessment): Functional outcome assessors who will perform post-procedure assessments are part of achieving unbiased study objectives.

Pre-event mRS scale 0-1\n5. Large vessel occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA)-M1 or M2 segments, basilar, or vertebral arteries as evidenced by MRA or CTA\n6. For strokes in anterior circulation, ASPECTS \\>=6; For strokes in posterior circulation, pc-ASPECTS \\>=8\n7. Non-contrast CT/CTA or MRI/MRA for trial eligibility performed or repeated at treating stroke center or outside medical facility within 2 hours of treatment initiation\n8. If indicated per American Heart Association clinical guidelines, thrombolytic therapy should be administered as soon as possible\n9. Consenting requirements met according to local IRB or Ethics Committee\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Female known to be pregnant at time of admission\n2. Patient has suffered a stroke in the past 3 months\n3. Presence of an existing or pre-existing large territory infarction\n4. Pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological or functional evaluation, e.g., dementia with prescribed anti-cholinesterase inhibitor\n5. Known history of severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast\n6.
