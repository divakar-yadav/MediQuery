The device is already CE marked and, for the purposes of the study, will be used in accordance with the intended use (after-market clinical investigation).","detailedDescription":"In early rehabilitation of neurological patients, safe mobilization and intensive sensorimotor stimulation are key factors for therapeutic success. Early activation and stimulation of the patient intend enhancement of neuroplasticity and recovery. Furthermore, it improves the patient's communication and cooperation skills and counteracts secondary damages due to immobilization.\n\nThe study combines gradual verticalization during monitoring of vital parameters, with cyclic leg movement and foot loading. The table to ensures the necessary safety for the stabilization of the patient in the upright position. The patient stimulation is additionally enhanced by synchronized functional electrical stimulation (FES). By providing a safe solution for early mobilization, the Erigo counteracts the negative effects of immobility and accelerates the recovery process through intensive sensorimotor stimulation. It is the first choice therapy device for the early and safe mobilization of severely impaired, bed-ridden patients even in acute care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spinal Cord Injury"],"keywords":["brain injury, early rehabilitation, tilt table"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single-arm study","type":"OTHER","description":"Early mobilization of patients after stroke or spinal cord injury.
