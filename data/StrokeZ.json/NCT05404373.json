NBO is simple and non-invasive and can be used at home or in an ambulance to ensure the shortest possible time after cerebral ischemia occurs. The previous study by the investigators suggested that NBO therapy in the early stage of cerebral ischemia has a neuroprotective effect on ischemic brain injury. Although the neuroprotective effect of NBO has been demonstrated, the optimal duration of treatment for NBO to exert neuroprotective effect is still unclear. Therefore, further discussion of the duration of NBO treatment will contribute to the clinical application of NBO and provide a definite theoretical basis for the treatment of cerebral infarction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Neuroprotection","Endovascular Treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low flow oxygen group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"patients were randomized into the Low flow oxygen group and immediately given 100% oxygen inhalation (no more than 30 minutes after admission) at a ventilation rate of 1L/ min using a oxygen storage mask and keep giving oxygen for 4 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: Low flow oxygen"]},{"label":"NBO group (2h)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients were randomized into the NBO group (2h) and immediately given 100% oxygen inhalation (no more than 30 minutes after admission) at a ventilation rate of 10L/ min using a oxygen storage mask and keep giving oxygen for 2 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: Normobaric Hyperoxia (NBO)"]},{"label":"NBO group (4h)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients were randomized into the NBO group (4h) and immediately given 100% oxygen inhalation (no more than 30 minutes after admission) at a ventilation rate of 10L/ min using a oxygen storage mask and keep giving oxygen for 4 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: Normobaric Hyperoxia (NBO)"]},{"label":"NBO group (6h)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients were randomized into the NBO group (6h) and immediately given 100% oxygen inhalation (no more than 30 minutes after admission) at a ventilation rate of 10L/ min using a oxygen storage mask and keep giving oxygen for 6 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: Normobaric Hyperoxia (NBO)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Normobaric Hyperoxia (NBO)","description":"NBO was inhaled as early as possible before revascularization, and inhaled for 1h/2h/4h according to different groups","armGroupLabels":["NBO group (2h)","NBO group (4h)","NBO group (6h)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Low flow oxygen","description":"immediately given oxygen inhalation at a ventilation rate of 1L/ min using a oxygen storage mask and keep giving oxygen for 4 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Low flow oxygen group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral infarct volume","description":"The infarct volume is evaluated by MRI or CT scan","timeFrame":"Within 72 hours after randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Scores assessed by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)","description":"secondary clinical efficacy endpoint;
