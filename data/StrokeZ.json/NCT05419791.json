Virtual reality is another component and its contribution to rehabilitation is important. When we look at the literature on virtual reality applications on balance and walking, it is seen that some systems are beneficial while some systems have no effect. This raises the possibility that virtual reality applications may produce different results due to the task in the exercise, patient motivation or any other reason. There is a need to investigate whether virtual reality applications have different effects, if any, what is the source of this and what care should be taken in the development of these applications in the future. Therefore, we focused on investigating the different effects of Lokomat virtual reality applications.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is an important health problem worldwide. Emotional, cognitive, sensory and motor problems occur with stroke. Motor problems are especially balance and walking problems and they are related to each other. So balance and gait rehabilitation are primary goals in stroke.\n\nAlthough the first study to support the efficacy of Lokomat is that Lokomat is superior to conventional physiotherapy in walking, there are also studies reporting that there is no difference between the effects of Lokomat and conventional physiotherapy and that conventional physiotherapy is superior. In the light of all these studies, the effectiveness of applying robotic systems together with conventional physiotherapy is widely accepted.\n\nRobot Assisted Walking Training has many components such as guiding force, walking speed, body weight support. Virtual reality is one of these components and there is literature in which Lokomat virtual reality applications are effective on balance and walking. Although the virtual reality effect is emphasized for Lokomat, there is a lack of literature on the specific effect of different virtual reality applications. In our study, it was aimed to examine the changes caused by different Lokomat virtual reality applications in the spatiotemporal parameters of balance and gait.\n\nMethod: This study was conducted to examine the effects of Lokomat VR applications on balance and spatiotemporal parameters of gait in patients with chronic stroke; It is a prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind study. The study will be carried out in a single-blind manner, and the evaluator will not know which group the individual is in. 56 individuals with chronic stroke included our study. All individuals have been informed about the study and read and signed the consent form stating that they voluntarily participated in the study. For balance evaluation we used Berg Balance Scale and Huber 360 device, which measures postural stability and limits of stability. And for gait evaluation we used 10 MWT, 6 MWT and spatiotemporal gait analysis for C-Mill VR+."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Augmented performance feedback","Lokomat","Stroke","Rehabilitation","Virtual Reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Individuals have been assigned to groups by Research Randomizer program.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessor has been masked.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lokomat Group I (Endurance)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Faster application used with Lokomat gait training\n* Conventional Physiotherapy","interventionNames":["Other: Robot Asisted Gait Training with Lokomat (Endurance)","Other: Conventional Physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Lokomat Group II (Attention and Motivation)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Smile and Gabarello applications used with Lokomat gait training\n* Conventional Physiotherapy","interventionNames":["Other: Robot Asisted Gait Training with Lokomat (Attention and Motivation)","Other: Conventional Physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Lokomat Group III (Activity Timing)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* High Flyer, Curve Pursuit and Treasures applications used with Lokomat gait training\n* Conventional Physiotherapy","interventionNames":["Other: Robot Asisted Gait Training with Lokomat (Activity Timing)","Other: Conventional Physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Control","type":"OTHER","description":"-Only Conventional Physiotherapy","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot Asisted Gait Training with Lokomat (Endurance)","description":"* Faster application (using for Endurance) : 3 days in a week for 6 weeks,very season was 40 min.\n* Conventional Physiotherapy : 5 days in a week for 6 weeks, every seanson was 40 min.","armGroupLabels":["Lokomat Group I (Endurance)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot Asisted Gait Training with Lokomat (Attention and Motivation)","description":"* Smile application (using for Attetion and Motivation) : 3 days in a week for 6 weeks,very season was 20 min.\n* Gabarello application (using for Attetion and Motivation) : 3 days in a week for 6 weeks,very season was 20 min.\n* Conventional Physiotherapy : 5 days in a week for 6 weeks, every seanson was 40 min.","armGroupLabels":["Lokomat Group II (Attention and Motivation)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot Asisted Gait Training with Lokomat (Activity Timing)","description":"* High Flyer application (using for Activity Timing) : 3 days in a week for 6 weeks,very season was 20 min.\n* Treasures application (using for Activity Timing) : 3 days in a week for 6 weeks,very season was 10 min.\n* Curve Pursuit application (using for Activity Timing) : 3 days in a week for 6 weeks,very season was 10 min.\n* Conventional Physiotherapy : 5 days in a week for 6 weeks, every seanson was 40 min.","armGroupLabels":["Lokomat Group III (Activity Timing)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Physiotherapy","description":"-Conventional Physiotherapy : 5 days in a week for 6 weeks, every seanson was 40 min.","armGroupLabels":["Control","Lokomat Group I (Endurance)","Lokomat Group II (Attention and Motivation)","Lokomat Group III (Activity Timing)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in 6 MWT","description":"6 Minutes Walk Test is a test using for walking distance.
