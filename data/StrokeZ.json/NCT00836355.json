Minocycline (brand name Minocin速) is a tetracycline antibiotic approved to treat a number of bacterial infections in humans. The investigators are studying these medications in acute human stroke because they have each been separately shown to reduce the amount of injured brain tissue in rats made to have acute ischemic stroke experimentally. In a human trial comparing minocycline with placebo (a sugar pill) acute ischemic stroke patients who took minocycline had better recovery after 1 week, 1 month and 3 months than patients who took placebo.","detailedDescription":"Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (average molecular weight 4,500 daltons, vs. 12,000 to 15,000 daltons for unfractionated heparin) administered subcutaneously and intravenously. It is a marketed drug FDA-approved in various clinical situations for: the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis; and in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Minocycline is an orally administered antibiotic of the tetracycline class. It is a marketed drug FDA-approved for the treatment of various bacterial and rickettsial infections. Both medications have been found to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke models. Minocycline has shown promise in a human acute stroke study.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate two logistically simple treatment regimens, singly or in combination, employing these medications for acute ischemic stroke:\n\n1. pulsed intravenous (iv) administration of enoxaparin initiated within 6 hours and completed by 24 hours after stroke onset; and\n2. oral minocycline treatment once daily for five days.\n\nThe goal of treatment is neuroprotection: the limitation of the loss of brain tissue that follows ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","magnetic resonance imaging","enoxaparin","minocycline","NIH stroke scale","modified Rankin scale","neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Enoxaparin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Enoxaparin"]},{"label":"Minocycline","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Minocycline 200 mg orally once daily for 5 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Minocycline"]},{"label":"Enoxaparin and minocycline","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Enoxaparin","Drug: Minocycline"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Enoxaparin","description":"2 (or 3) intravenous doses, the first on study entry, the last 24 hours later","armGroupLabels":["Enoxaparin","Enoxaparin and minocycline"],"otherNames":["Lovenox速"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Minocycline","description":"200 mg orally once daily for 5 days","armGroupLabels":["Enoxaparin and minocycline","Minocycline"],"otherNames":["Minocin速"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Indices of Salvaged Ischemic Penumbra and of Final Infarct Volume Based on Quantitative Volumetric Analyses of Pre- and Post-treatment Perfusion-weighted and Diffusion-weighted Brain MR Imaging","timeFrame":"Within approximately 7 days of stroke onset"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIH Stroke Scale Scores","timeFrame":"Baseline and after approximately one week"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale Score","timeFrame":"Baseline, and approximately one week and 3 months later"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"There are two Study Sections: A and B\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nStudy Section A Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. acute ischemic stroke in an adult in-patient who can complete screening and begin study treatment within 6 hours of stroke onset (onset time defined as the last time the patient was known to be at his/her usual level of functioning)\n2. patient not a candidate for rTPA treatment because treatment cannot be started within the required 3 hours after stroke onset, or because rTPA treatment is refused.\n\nStudy Section A Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. intracranial hemorrhage;\n2. subfalcine, transtentorial, or foramen magnum herniation on CT or MRI scan of the brain;\n3. history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to or toxicity from enoxaparin, other heparinoids, heparin, minocycline, or other tetracyclines;\n4. weight 125lbs or less;\n5. active bleeding;\n6. thrombolytic treatment or major surgery in the previous 24 hours;\n7. anticipated need for treatment with coumarin, or a low-molecular weight heparin other than enoxaparin, or unfractionated heparin before 36 hours after stroke onset (but see deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, below);\n8.
