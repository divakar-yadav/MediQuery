To examine the treatment effects of a new digital mirror therapy (MT) system versus a mirror box in patients with stroke by conducting a 4-group randomized controlled trial.\n2. To examine the electrophysiological mechanisms of uni-mirror visual feedback (uni-MVF) condition with unimanual training mode, uni-MVF condition with bimanual training mode, and bi-MVF condition with bimanual training mode in the new MT system by EEG.","detailedDescription":"Part I: Validation of Treatment Efficacy of the New Digital MT System with Different MVF Conditions and Training Modes\n\nIn this new MT system, 3 different types of MT in different MVF conditions and training modes can be provided: unilateral MVF with unimanual training mode (UM-UT), unilateral MVF with bimanual training mode (UM-BT), and bilateral MVF with bimanual training mode (BM-BT). In the part Ⅰ study, an estimated total of 80 patients with stroke will be recruited. In addition to the original rehabilitation interventions of patients, each participant will be randomly allocated to 1 of 4 intervention groups (i.e., UM-UT, UM-BT, BM-BT, or traditional MT using a mirror box) for 15-hour therapy sessions. Outcome measures will be administrated at pre-treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 1-month follow-up after treatment.\n\nPart II: Investigation of the Electrophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Different MVF Conditions by EEG\n\nTwenty stroke patients will be recruited for examining the brain electrophysiological mechanisms underlying different types of MVF and training conditions of this new system by using electroencephalography (EEG). Three experimental conditions, including UM-UT, UM-BT, and BM-BT conditions, will be conducted in the EEG study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Central Nervous System Diseases"],"keywords":["digital rehabilitation","cerebrovascular accident","mirror visual feedback","brain electrophysiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Uni-MVF condition and unimanual training mode using the new MT system (UM-UT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The following common categories of upper-limb movements and actions will be selected and included in this group: (a) active range of motion (AROM) exercises, (b) reaching movements, and (c) object manipulation.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Uni-MVF condition and unimanual training mode using the new MT system (UM-UT)"]},{"label":"Uni-MVF condition and bimanual training mode using the new MT system (UM-BT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The following common categories of upper-limb movements and actions will be selected and included in this group: (a) active range of motion (AROM) exercises, (b) reaching movements, and (c) object manipulation.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Uni-MVF condition and bimanual training mode using the new MT system (UM-BT)"]},{"label":"Bi-MVF condition and bimanual training mode using the new MT system (BM-BT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The following common categories of upper-limb movements and actions will be selected and included in this group: (a) active range of motion (AROM) exercises, (b) reaching movements, and (c) object manipulation.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Bi-MVF condition and bimanual training mode using the new MT system (BM-BT)"]},{"label":"Traditional MT using a mirror box","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The following common categories of upper-limb movements and actions will be selected and included in this group: (a) active range of motion (AROM) exercises, (b) reaching movements, and (c) object manipulation.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Traditional MT using a mirror box"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Uni-MVF condition and unimanual training mode using the new MT system (UM-UT)","description":"For the UM-UT group, the participants will be seated in front of the new MT system, and will be instructed to watch the real-time image reflection of movements of the non-affected arm and hand on the screen carefully.
