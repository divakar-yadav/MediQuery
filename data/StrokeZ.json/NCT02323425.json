And more and more young patients account for the increasing morbidity. Among them, Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis（sICAS）is a major cause, especially in Asians.\n\nCurrently, traditional therapeutic methods present reluctant achievements on reducing stroke recurrence and pose threat on patients'health because of invasive operation and severe side effects. Therefore, other treatment methods are called for urgently. Remote ischemic post-conditioning refers to local or distal ischemia treatment after the occurrence of cerebral ischemia. Prior research has shown that repeatedly ischemic reperfusion have protective effect on lowering the occurrence rate of ischemic events of patients with carotid stenosis. However, in-depth research on cerebral protection and correlation with collateral circulation has not been proven in an open, definitive clinical trial.\n\nThus, the EPIC-sICAS trial will provide important information on the protective effects of upper limb ischemic post-conditioning on collateral circulation after cerebral Infarction. Hopefully to present us a very meaningful way to improve the patient's quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Remote ischemic postconditioning","symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Remote Ischemic Postconditioning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"remote ischemic postconditioning（RIPC） treatment was performed by the inflating a cuff around bilateral arms to 180 mmHg with 5 cycles of 3 min inflation and 5 min relax alternation twice a day for the total of 180 consecutive days.","interventionNames":["Device: Remote ischemic postconditioning"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients in control group will receive foundation treatment.
