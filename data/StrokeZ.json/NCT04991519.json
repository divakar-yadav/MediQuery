Each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses in communication and cognition, and a unique course of recovery. The BUILD study aims to understand the brain basis of these individual differences in stroke outcome. Participants with stroke as well as controls matched in age, educational background, race, and sex are examined using a combination of standardized and in-house tests of language and cognition to provide a detailed profile of strengths and weaknesses. Each participant will have between three and six sessions, including an MRI to measure details of the structure, function, and connections in the brain. The data are analyzed to test how patterns in the stroke lesion explain the patterns of communication and cognitive difficulties, and how patterns in the uninjured parts of the brain explain resilience and recovery from the stroke. Ultimately, we hope that BUILD will guide us toward new targets for brain stimulation treatments or other biologically based treatments that improve language and cognitive abilities after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke","Alexia"],"keywords":["aphasia","stroke","brain injury","speech","language","reading","alexia","apraxia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Survivors","description":"Participants have had a left-hemisphere stroke with or without aphasia, or a stroke elsewhere in the brain causing aphasia.
