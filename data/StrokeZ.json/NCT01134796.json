Secondary outcome measures are: 1) movement duration, 2) time of maximum aperture expressed as % of movement duration, 3) time of peak deceleration expressed as % of movement duration, 4) amplitude of peak velocity of the wrist, 5) time of peak velocity, 6) time of peak velocity of the wrist expressed as % movement duration, 7) size of maximum aperture, 8) time to close hand from time of maximum aperture, 9) distance to target at time of maximum aperture.","timeFrame":"3 sessions"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Damage to the following areas of the brain, all of which may be involved in coordination of reach to grasp confirmed by CT scan: parietal, cerebellar, internal capsule and basal ganglia,\n2. A score of 6 or more on the arm section of the Rivermead Motor Assessment (able to reach and pick up a tennis ball and release on thigh),\n3. Time between start of hand opening and start of hand transport \\> 60 ms (measured with GRASP).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Cognitive dysfunction which prevents understanding of the task,\n2. Severe concurrent medical problems that prevent repetitive reaching (including shoulder pain),\n3. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, or\n4.
