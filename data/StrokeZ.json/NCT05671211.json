It scores from 4 (normal performance) to 0 (not able to do the movement) according to the person's ability to do what is asked of them safely and independently. The total score is 56 points. 0-20 indicates high risk, 21-40 indicates medium risk, and 41-64 indicates low risk.","timeFrame":"six weeks"},{"measure":"10 Meter Walking Test(10MWT)","description":"This test calculates the unassisted walking speed of individuals at a distance of 10 meters. In this test, the person will be asked to walk at their normal pace in a pre-measured 10 meter area.","timeFrame":"siz weeks"},{"measure":"Timed Up And Go Test (TUG)","description":"It is a frequently used test that evaluates functional mobility and dynamic balance. At the beginning of the test, individuals sit in a chair. A distance of 3 m is set in front of the patient. With the start command, the patient gets up from his seat and walks 3 m, turns around and walks back and sits. With the start command, the time until the moment of sitting on the chair is recorded in seconds.Shorter duration indicates better functional mobility.","timeFrame":"siz weeks"},{"measure":"Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale(SS-QOL)","description":"The Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale evaluates the quality of life in post-stroke individuals.\n\nIt consists of 49 items from 12 areas;energy, family roles, language, mobility, mood, personality, self-care, social roles, thinking, upper extremity function, vision, work/productivity. Each item is evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. Maximum score is 245, high scores indicates good quality of life.","timeFrame":"six weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"5 Times Sit to Stand Test(5XSST)","description":"The 5 Repetitive Sit-Rise Test (5XSST) is a practical test that evaluates lower extremity functional strength and balance.The individual rests on a standard 43 cm chair, arms crossed over shoulders, feet on the floor.Individual will be asked to sit and stand up quickly 5 times. Duration of 5 repetitions will be recorded in seconds.Results below 15 seconds indicate good stability, while 15 seconds and above indicate impaired balance and function.","timeFrame":"six weeks"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)","description":"Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) is a common clinical gait assessment method. Walking ability is scored between 0-5 according to the amount of support needed during the training and classification is made over 6 categories.. 5 points indicate fully independent ambulation while 0 points indicate non-functional ambulation .","timeFrame":"six weeks"},{"measure":"Functional Independence Scale (FIM)","description":"Functional Independence Scale is used to evaluate activities of daily living.- It consists of a total of 18 items(13 physical,5 social) that include cognitive status assessment. Each item is scored between 1 and 7. 7 means that the specified item is performed completely independently, while 1 indicates the need of full assistance. The maximum score that can be obtained from the scale is 126, indicating good performance. The lowest score is 18 and shows poor performance.","timeFrame":"six weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Modified Rankin score between 0-3\n* Having a stroke for the first time\n* At least 1 month has passed since the stroke\n* Able to walk 10 M with or without assistance\n* Having a Mini Mental Test score of 24 and above\n* Volunteering to participate in the study\n* Being fluent in Turkish language\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having an additional neurological disease other than stroke\n* Having an additional disease that prevents mobility\n* Having a condition that prevents you from exercising\n* Receiving an existing additional medical treatment for spasticity treatment\n* Having a history of multiple strokes\n* Having severe visual problems post stoke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Mehmet OZKESKIN, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+905056631833","email":"mehmet.ozkeskin99@gmail.com"},{"name":"BENNU D.
