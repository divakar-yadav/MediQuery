Because it is possible that such therapy may be more effective during the early recovery phase after the stroke and can reach patients during the rehabilitation phase, investigators wished to explore the applicability, efficacy and safety of early intervention with a combined tDCS/VRT treatment.\n\n19 post-acute stroke homonymous hemianopia patients were randomly assigned to either 10 sessions of combined rea-tDCS (2mA, 10 daily sessions of 15-20 min) and VRT, or sham-tDCS and VRT. The primary outcome criterion was the pre-post change in perimetric detection thresholds. Secondary outcome is neurophysiological changes in EEG measures (VEP, Connectivity, Spectral Power, ...)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemianopia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Verum tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Verum group receiving complete treatment of tDCS","interventionNames":["Device: verum tDCS","Behavioral: VRT"]},{"label":"sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham group receiving sham tDCS","interventionNames":["Device: sham tDCS","Behavioral: VRT"]},{"label":"real VRT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Real Vision Restoration Training","interventionNames":["Device: verum tDCS","Device: sham tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"verum tDCS","description":"real transcranial direct current stimulation,10 sessions, 2mA for 20 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Verum tDCS","real VRT"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham tDCS","description":"sham transcranial direct current stimulation, 10 sessions, for 20 minutes","armGroupLabels":["real VRT","sham tDCS"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"VRT","description":"Vision restoration training, 10 sessions, 20 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Verum tDCS","sham tDCS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of mean sensitivity (in dB) detection threshold from baseline to post-intervention and follow up","timeFrame":"14-20 days post treatment, 3 months follow up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in power spectra (Volts-squared per Hz (V^2/Hz) from baseline to post-intervention and follow up","description":"power spectra (Volts-squared per Hz (V\\^2/Hz)","timeFrame":"14-20 days post treatment, 3 months follow up"},{"measure":"Change in VEP latencies (ms) from baseline to post-intervention and follow up","description":"VEP latencies (ms)","timeFrame":"14-20 days post treatment, 3 months follow up"},{"measure":"Change in VEP amplitudes (µV) from baseline to post-intervention and follow up","description":"VEP amplitudes (µV)","timeFrame":"14-20 days post treatment, 3 months follow up"},{"measure":"Change in network coherence from baseline to post-intervention and follow up","description":"network coherence correlations","timeFrame":"14-20 days post treatment, 3 months follow up"},{"measure":"Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events assessed by a questionnaire","description":"questionnaire recording adverse effects","timeFrame":"up to 4 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke\n* Visual Field Defect\n* Lesion age 4 weeks up to 6 month max.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Electrical Implants\n* Metal artefacts in head\n* Epilepsy\n* Visual Neglect","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bernhard A Sabel, Prof. Dr.","affiliation":"Institute of Medical Psychology","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Neurologisches Therapiezentrum Gmundnerberg","city":"Altmuenster","zip":"4813","country":"Austria"},{"facility":"Inst. f.
