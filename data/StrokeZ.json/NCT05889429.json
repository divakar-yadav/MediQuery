The research includes stroke patients and healthy patients (control group).","detailedDescription":"The recovery process, especially the recovery of motor functions after an ischemic stroke, differs from one person to another. In recent years, there is more evidence of spontaneous biological recovery (SBR), which is independent of training or rehabilitation-induced recovery, throughout the post-stroke subacute phase. However, the neural basis associated with motor function in this recovery phase remains unknown. We believe that the research results may help to explain the neural mechanism which promotes or inhibits recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"brain ischemic stroke patients","description":"Participants who meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nAll participants will undergo four testing sessions spanning the acute and subacute post-stroke phases:\n\nSession 1 (t1) - 2-14 days from stroke onset Session 2 (t2) - 4 weeks (± 7 days) after the stroke Session 3 (t3) - 8 weeks (± 7 days) after the stroke Session 4 (t4) - 12 weeks (± 7 days) after the stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: MRI scans","Behavioral: clinical assessments"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"Participants with healthy age and gender-matched with no history of neurological impairments.\n\nEach participant will visit the testing sites 4 times within one month between different sessions.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: MRI scans"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"MRI scans","description":"The MRI protocol will include standard anatomical, functional, and diffusion imaging, and spectroscopy sequences.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","brain ischemic stroke patients"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"clinical assessments","description":"Several clinical assessments will be performed to evaluate the recovery of motor functions.
