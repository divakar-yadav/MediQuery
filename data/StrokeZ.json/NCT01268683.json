Participants must be between 18-80 years of age, must have a baseline diffusion weighted image (DWI) lesion volume 82 -210 centimeters cubed (cm3), and time from symptom onset to start of study infusion must be ≤10 hour(hr). The secondary objectives are to assess the initial safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) /pharmacodynamics (PD) of glyburide in severe stroke participants, as well as to compare the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome data to benchmark data derived from published literature.","detailedDescription":"This is a multi-center, prospective, open label, phase IIa trial of glyburide for injection in 10 participants with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who are likely to experience clinically significant brain swelling.\n\nParticipants will receive glyburide, delivered as an IV bolus followed by an IV infusion for 72 hours.\n\nParticipants will have a baseline (pretreatment) MRI scan as standard of care, and three follow up MRI scans (at 24+12 hours, 48+12 hours, and 72±12 hours). Since recanalization may have an effect on outcome, the results of vascular studies, obtained as part of standard of care and defined as CTA, MRA or catheter angiography of the head and neck, will be recorded. Additionally, clinical endpoints such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Full Outline of UnResponsiveness Score (FOUR) Score (baseline, 24±12 hour, 48±12 hour, 72±12 hour and 7±1 days) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (30±5 days and 90±7 days) will be assessed. Safety parameters will be assessed through Day 7 or discharge (whichever is sooner), and then again at Day 30±5 and Day 90±7.\n\nStudy participation is expected to last 90±7 days.\n\nThis study was previously posted by Remedy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and has since been acquired by Biogen."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Glyburide for Injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This arm is administered a glyburide bolus followed by continuous infusion of glyburide for 72 hours","interventionNames":["Drug: Glyburide for Injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Glyburide for Injection","description":"Administered as specified in the treatment arm.","armGroupLabels":["Glyburide for Injection"],"otherNames":["RP-1127","glibenclamide","glybenclamide"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of Enrollment","description":"The number of months to enroll 10 participants.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Percentage of Enrolled Participants to Screened Participants","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Completing 90-Day Follow-Up","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Percentage of Dose Reductions/ Dose Suspensions","timeFrame":"Up to Day 3"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With All Four MRI Assessments Per Protocol","timeFrame":"Up to Day 3"},{"measure":"Number of MRI Assessments Per Participant","timeFrame":"Up to Day 3"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Requiring One or More Hypoglycemia Treatments","timeFrame":"Up to Day 4"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Pre-specified Adverse Events Associated With Glyburide According to Protocol","timeFrame":"Up to Day 4"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events","description":"Adverse Events (AE's) of special interest (cardiac events, difficulty controlling blood sugar, liver problems, and blood disorders, including anemia) will be followed for 30 days and all Severe Adverse Events (SAE's) will be followed for 90 days.
