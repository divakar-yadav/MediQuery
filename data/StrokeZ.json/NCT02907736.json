Thrombosis resistance after IV t-PA therapy is frequent especially in case of AIS with proximal occlusion. In recent years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as major triggers and structural factors of various forms of thrombosis. NETs are extracellular webs primarily composed of DNA from neutrophils. A recent study shows that the NETs burden in coronary thrombi is positively correlated with the infarct size and negatively correlated with electrocardiogram (ST-segment) resolution. This later study revealed that in vitro addition of DNase I accelerated the t-PA-induced thrombolysis of coronary thrombi. NETs could, in consequence, be promising targets for improved thrombolysis in AIS.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the impact of NETs composition of thrombi retrieved during endovascular therapy in AIS patients on IV t-PA induced thrombolysis, clinical outcome and AIS etiologies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"thrombus origin","description":"according to the etiology of the stroke (TOAST classification)","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"red cells counts","description":"quantitative assessment of the relative fractions of the main constituents after Hematoxylin and Eosin staining :","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"white cells counts","description":"quantitative assessment of the relative fractions of the main constituents after Hematoxylin and Eosin staining","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"platlet counts","description":"quantitative assessment of the relative fractions of the main constituents after Hematoxylin and Eosin staining","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age \\> 18 years old\n* AIS secondary to a large vessel occlusion\n* admitted for endovascular therapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or breast feeding patient patient under legal protection\n* Patient opposition to participate in this study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with acute stroke, admitted for endovascular therapy.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe DÃ©silles, MD","affiliation":"Fondation OPH A. de Rothschild","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Mikael Mazighi, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Fondation OPH A. de Rothschild","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild","city":"Paris","zip":"75019","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29438080","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Ducroux C, Di Meglio L, Loyau S, Delbosc S, Boisseau W, Deschildre C, Ben Maacha M, Blanc R, Redjem H, Ciccio G, Smajda S, Fahed R, Michel JB, Piotin M, Salomon L, Mazighi M, Ho-Tin-Noe B, Desilles JP.
