Some studies tried to find SV surrogates based on haemodynamic usual parameters. In an experimental hemorrhagic shock, SV was correlated to the pulse pressure (PP) / heart rate (HR) ratio.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that SV variations (ΔSV) would be correlated to the PP/HR ratio variations (ΔPP / HR) during fluid challenge, and ΔPP / HR would be able to detect a ΔSV greater than 10%."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypovolemia"],"keywords":["stroke volume, haemodynamic, fluid resucitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"fluid challenge of saline","description":"250 ml of saline","otherNames":["ΔPP/HR and ΔSV"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"correlation by linear regression between variations of the ratio PP/HR ( in percentage) and variations of SV ( in percentage) during fluid challenge","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC roc) of the ability of variations of the ratio PP/HR ( in percentage)during fluid challenge to predict an increase of SV greater than 10%","timeFrame":"18 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* a suspected hypovolemia, based on clinical or paraclinical parameters.\n* a fluid challenge decision at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist physician in charge of the patient.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Minor or major patient under guardianship,\n* oesophageal Diseases","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"General anaesthesia.Orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation Advanced Haemodynamic Monitoring intraoperative ( arterial pressure catheter, oesophageal Doppler)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Olivier REBET","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33231064736","email":"rebet-o@chu-caen.fr"},{"name":"Jean Luc Hanouz","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33231064736","email":"hanouz-jl@chu-caen.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Olivier REBET","affiliation":"CHU CAEN","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CAEN University Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Caen","state":"Basse Normandie","zip":"1400","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Olivier REBET, M.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33611131751","email":"rebet-o@chu-caen.fr"},{"name":"Jean Luc HANOUZ, M.D;Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","email":"hanouz-jl@chu-caen.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":49.18585,"lon":-0.35912}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020896","term":"Hypovolemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22324","name":"Hypovolemia","asFound":"Hypovolemia","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
