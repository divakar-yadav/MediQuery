Individuals with chronic stroke will be randomized to one of four different interventions: (1) traditional clinic-based CI therapy (35 therapist/client contact hours), (2) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic and 15 hours of independent game play at home), (3) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy with additional therapist contact via telerehabilitation (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 2.6 therapist contact hours via teleconference, and 15 hours of independent game play in the home), and (4) 5 hours of standard occupational therapy (OT) / physical therapy (PT). After 6-month follow-up, individuals assigned to standard OT/PT will cross over to a modified gaming therapy condition (a stand-alone application of the rehabilitation game without additional therapist contact).","detailedDescription":"Detailed study description published in BMC Neurology (2017)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Constraint-induced movement therapy","gaming","virtual reality","upper extremity","CI therapy","rehabilitation","stroke","hemiparesis","therapy","self-management","in-home","remote","telerehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":193,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Traditional CI Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive a 35-hour \"dose\" of CI therapy.
