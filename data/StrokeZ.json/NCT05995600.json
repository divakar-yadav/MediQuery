The clinical guidelines suggest using warfarin for APS-related stroke, but these suggestions are largely based on retrospective studies from the 1990s and expert opinion, rather than high-quality clinical trials. Moreover, the evidence on the role of antiplatelet drugs other than aspirin (e.g., clopidogrel) in APS-related stroke is particularly limited. Considering the relatively young age of patients with APS and the high clinical burden of using warfarin, it is necessary to verify whether warfarin is essential. Thus, the investigators aim to compare clopidogrel-based antiplatelet therapy and warfarin as a secondary preventive medication for patients with APS-related stroke. APS-STROKE is an exploratory, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, blinded-endpoint clinical trial. Adult patients with definite APS who have a history of ischemic stroke will be included. Patients with high-risk APS (triple positivity or persistently high titers of anti-cardiolipin or anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies), systemic lupus erythematous, or indications for continued antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy will be excluded. Eligible patients will be 1:1 randomized to receive clopidogrel-based antiplatelet therapy or warfarin. Patients assigned to the clopidogrel-based antiplatelet therapy group will be permitted to use additional antiplatelet drugs other than clopidogrel at the investigator's discretion. The primary outcome is a composite of any death, major adverse cardiovascular events, systemic thromboembolic events, and major bleeding during a follow-up period of at least 2 years. This study would provide valuable information for determining the optimal secondary prevention strategy for APS-related stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Antiphospholipid Syndrome","Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack","Cerebrovascular Disease","Cardiovascular Diseases","Major Bleed"],"keywords":["Antiphospholipid syndrome","Ischemic stroke","Secondary prevention","Thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) trial","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Clopidogrel-based antiplatelet therapy group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Clopidogrel 75 mg daily\n\nPatients assigned to this group will be permitted to use additional antiplatelet drugs other than clopidogrel at the investigator's discretion.","interventionNames":["Drug: Antiplatelet Drug"]},{"label":"Warfarin group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Warfarin (target prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0)","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Antiplatelet Drug","description":"Clopidogrel ± other antiplatelet drug","armGroupLabels":["Clopidogrel-based antiplatelet therapy group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin","description":"Warfarin (target prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0)","armGroupLabels":["Warfarin group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite endpoint","description":"Composite endpoint of any death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), systemic thromboembolic events, and major bleeding.
