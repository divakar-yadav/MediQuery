Results of arterial bed ultrasound examination (US), results of ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements, along with clinical and anamnestic data on target organ damage in the MFA-affected areas will be used as the main source verifying the presence MFA.\n\nThe follow-up period for each patient will span from the date of inclusion and over the next year with an additional 6 and 12 months of follow-up.\n\nPatients eligible for entry in the Register must be included and their details must be documented. The procedure for obtaining informed consent for the examination and collection of data must comply with the requirements of local legislation. Patients will be required to sign an informed consent document if required.\n\nStandardized electronic CRFs will be used in all research centers. The electronic data collection (EDC) system must be validated in accordance with current standards and legal requirements. Researchers will log into this system using individually assigned usernames and passwords. Data can only be entered and corrected by the researcher or other authorized personnel of the research center."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Polyvascular
