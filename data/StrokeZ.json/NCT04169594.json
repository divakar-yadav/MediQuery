However, it is complex and requires an understanding of the activation of muscles in lower limbs, trunk, and upper limbs in a specific spatiotemporal pattern and the appropriate joint positions which support and advance the body weight in different phases of gait cycles.\n\nIn study, we plan to pilot the application of 3D gait analysis with statistical modelling in 2 common causes of gait deviation: unilateral hemiplegic stroke and unilateral lower limb amputation.","detailedDescription":"This is a pilot study on the use of 3D gait analysis using motion capture in combination with Statistical Parametric Mapping in patients with unilateral hemiplegic stroke and unilateral lower limb amputation. Data collected will then be compared against a normative dataset.\n\nThe findings from this study will then be used to build a decision support tool in combination with clinical analysis which could focus clinical recommendations for gait training, physical therapy, exercise and orthotics prescription to reduce unnecessary joint forces in affected and unaffected segments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Amputation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"Unilateral hemiplegic stroke patients","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: 3D Gait Analysis with Statistical Parametric Mapping"]},{"label":"Amputee","description":"Unilateral transtibial amputee patients","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: 3D Gait Analysis with Statistical Parametric Mapping"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"3D Gait Analysis with Statistical Parametric Mapping","description":"A 3D motion capture system will be used for gait analysis.
