Well designed studies have shown that the majority of the stroke population have low aerobic capacity and many are inactive. This is negative for their health and well-being. Physical inactivity may increase their risk of having recurrent stroke.\n\nThe optimal training mode and intensity to improve aerobic capacity after stroke are not clear. High intensity interval training (ie. 90-95% of peak heart rate) has been proven to be more beneficial than moderate and low intensity exercise in order to improve maximal oxygen uptake in patients with cardiac disease. The response from this training on aerobic capacity and physical function in the stroke population are not known."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Exercise training","Oxygen
