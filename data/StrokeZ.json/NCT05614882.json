Another goal is to compare post stroke behavior and medication compliance in participants receiving the new verbal model of stroke education vs. those receiving the current written stroke education.\n\nThe main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the current delivery of stroke education provide the necessary knowledge base for patients who have suffered a stroke as measured by a stroke questionnaire?\n* Does verbal education provide better understanding for patients post-stroke?\n* Are patients more likely to be compliant with medications and followup visits with their medical team after receiving verbal education? Participants will receive a health literacy assessment and based on their scores will be categorized into a high health literacy (HHL) or low health literacy group (LHL). Individuals in both literacy groups will be randomized into receiving verbal or written stroke education. All participants will be tested with the stroke knowledge assessment to measure learning after education.\n\nResearchers will compare written to verbal education to see if verbal results in more stroke education and compliance.","detailedDescription":"The primary objective of this study is to restructure the current model of stroke education using verbal delivery of information that is accessible and understood by individuals of different cultural backgrounds and various literacy levels. Participants in this study will be provided with a new model of stroke education through verbal communication to educate them on factors related to stroke using vocabulary that is more familiar and understood by individuals with lower literacy levels. The current delivery of stroke information is carried out through a model that involves mainly written communication. Data will be collected to better understand the efficacy of the current written model of stroke education compared to the new verbal education and determine which of the two methods of delivering information is more compatible with the literacy levels of the community served by Yale New Haven Hospital.\n\nThe second part of the study, participants' electronic medical record (EMR) will be reviewed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post stroke to evaluate the attendance post stroke follow up visits, post stroke blood pressure readings and overall medication compliance.\n\nParticipants in this study will be based from a convenience sample from the Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Milford, Connecticut. Participants will be admitted post-stroke after being diagnosed with stroke of mild to moderate severity.\n\nAll the participants will receive a health literacy assessment and based on their scores will be categorized into a high health literacy (HHL) or low health literacy group (LHL) prior to randomization.\n\nAssessments will be completed during the participants inpatient stay. A run in pilot study of 20 anticipated participants will be carried out prior to the larger study. The larger study was registered in anticipation of NIH funding."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Individuals in this study will be based from a convenience sample from the Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Milford, Connecticut.
