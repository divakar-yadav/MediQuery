Therefore, the investigators try to facilitate upper extremity function and normalize the muscle tone to enlarge their capacity to perform daily activities and to improve life quality by modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) and Kinesiotaping (KT).\n\nThe investigators will collect 90 subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia in this study. These 90 patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups. In KT group (n=30), the patients will perform Kinesiology taping for 5 days per week for 3 weeks. In mCIMT group (n=30), the patient will receive constraint the unaffected limb for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for three weeks. In KT+mCIMT group, the KT and mCIMT interventions would be performed for 5 days a week in three weeks. All the patients in KT, CIMT and KT+mCIMT groups will receive 20-minute hand function training twice daily for 5 days per week for 3 weeks. Before intervention, immediately and 3 week later after intervention, all patients will receive the physical examinations including motor recovery stage (Brunnstrom stage), spasticity (modified Ashworth scale and Tardieu scale), and sensation. Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE), box and block test, Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function (STEF), and Wolf Motor Function Test for hand function, ADL and quality of life assessment and musculoskeletal sonography for affected forearms will be also evaluated in this study.\n\nThe aims of this study are:\n\n1. To investigate the effect of Kinesiotaping and modified CIMT in improving upper extremity function and spasticity for subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia.\n2. To explore the role of sonoelastography and shear wave velocity in poststroke spasticity assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Kinesiotaping","constraint induced movement therapy","sonography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"KT group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"the patients will perform Kinesiotaping for 5 days per week for 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Device: Kinesiotaping"]},{"label":"mCIMT group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"the unaffected limb will be constraint for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for three weeks.\n\nAnd they will receive sham taping on the affected limb.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: modified Constraint Induced Movement Training","Device: Sham taping"]},{"label":"KT+mCIMT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"the patients will perform Kinesiology taping for 5 days per week for 3 weeks, and while being taped, the modified Constraint Induced Movement Training would be also executed.","interventionNames":["Device: Kinesiotaping","Behavioral: modified Constraint Induced Movement Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Kinesiotaping","description":"Kinesio tape would be applied over the extensor muscles of the affected hand for facilitating the extension of hand.
