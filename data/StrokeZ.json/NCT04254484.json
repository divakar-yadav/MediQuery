In this proposal, a multidisciplinary group of researchers with expertise in rehabilitation medicine, sleep medicine, nursing, physical therapy, wearable technologies, and implementation science will adapt, implement and evaluate a state-of-the-art intervention to promote sleep for stroke patients undergoing acute rehabilitation. SIESTA-Rehab, adapted from a previous unit-based intervention, bundles two sleep-promoting interventions to address the unique sleep challenges stroke patients face during acute rehabilitation: (1) nursing education and empowerment to reduce unnecessary disruptions; (2) a systematic protocol to screen, diagnose, and treat sleep-disordered breathing if present during acute stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep","Sleep Disordered Breathing","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SIESTA Rehab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke floor on which nurses will be receiving training (SIESTA Rehab Education) on how to minimize nighttime disruptions and batching overnight tasks to preserve sleep for patients hospitalized on that floor.
