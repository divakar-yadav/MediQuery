While therapists widely recognize that customization is critical to recovery, little is understood about how take advantage of statistical analysis tools to aid in the process of designing individualized training. Our approach first creates a model of a person's own unique movement deficits, and then creates a practice environment to correct these problems. Experiments will determine how the deficit-field approach can improve (1) reaching accuracy, (2) range of motion, and (3) activities of daily living. The findings will not only shed light on how to improve therapy for stroke survivors, it will test hypotheses about fundamental processes of practice and learning. This study will help us move closer to our long-term goal of clinically effective treatments using interactive devices."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","upper extremity","motor exploration","error augmentation","robotic rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Deficit-fields to reduce error","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"We hypothesize that a deficit-field design, using the statistics of a patient's errors to customize training, will provide optimal augmentation that varies during motion as needed.

Our work builds upon these ideas by augmenting self-directed movement for training coordination. We found that amplifying augmentation can expand motor exploration and improve skill retention in patients. Using motor exploration patterns from each patient, we will form customized deficit-fields to recover normal joint workspace.

However, typical robotic systems have only a single contact point and cannot drive the multiple joints involved in functional tasks. Visual distortions (e.g. a shift, rotation or stretch) can promote adaptation even without forces. Here we present visual distortion of whole body movement during manual tasks during standing, including reaching, grasping, and object manipulation. We compare the training effects of feedback based on deficit-fields versus practice with normal vision.","armGroupLabels":["Deficit-fields to improve function"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Arm motor recovery scores on the Fugl-Meyer","description":"Change from baseline in arm motor recovery as measured by Fugl-Meyer","timeFrame":"Baseline at beginning of week 1 and 3 prior to intervention; post-evaluation at end of week 4; follow-up evaluation at end of week 5"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of blocks transferred in Box and Blocks Test","description":"Change from baseline in number of blocks transferred during Box and Blocks Test","timeFrame":"Baseline at beginning of week 1 and 3 prior to intervention; post-evaluation at end of week 4; follow-up evaluation at end of week 5"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)","description":"Change from baseline in amount of spasticity in elbow flexors and extensors","timeFrame":"Baseline at beginning of week 1 and 3 prior to intervention; post-evaluation at end of week 4; follow-up evaluation at end of week 5"},{"measure":"Elbow active range of motion (ROM)","description":"Change from baseline measured in degrees for elbow flexion and extension","timeFrame":"Baseline at beginning of week 1 and 3 prior to intervention; post-evaluation at end of week 4; follow-up evaluation at end of week 5"},{"measure":"Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment for Hand","description":"Change in baseline in amount of hand motor recovery as measured by Chedoke scale","timeFrame":"Baseline at beginning of week 1 and 3 prior to intervention; post-evaluation at end of week 4; follow-up evaluation at end of week 5"},{"measure":"Time and completion score for Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","description":"Change in baseline score and time for completion of functional measures as part of ARAT","timeFrame":"Baseline at beginning of week 1 and 3 prior to intervention; post-evaluation at end of week 4; follow-up evaluation at end of week 5"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nSTROKE SURVIVORS:\n\n* adult (age \\>18)\n* Chronic stage stroke recovery (8+ months post)\n* available medical records and radiographic information about lesion locations\n* strokes caused by an ischemic infarct in the middle cerebral artery\n* primary motor cortex involvement\n* a Fugl-Meyer score (between 15-50) to evaluate arm motor impairment level\n\nHEALTHY CONTROL PARTICIPANTS:\n\n* adult (age \\>18)\n* healthy individuals with no history of stroke or neural injury\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* bilateral paresis;\n* severe sensory deficits in the limb\n* severe spasticity (Modified Ashworth of 4) preventing movement\n* aphasia, cognitive impairment or affective dysfunction that would influence the ability to perform the experiment\n* inability to provide an informed consent\n* severe current medical problems\n* diffuse/multiple lesion sites or multiple stroke events\n* hemispatial neglect or visual field cut that would prevent subjects from seeing the targets.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"James L Patton, PhD","affiliation":"Shirley Ryan AbilityLab","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60611","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"32316977","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wright ZA, Majeed YA, Patton JL, Huang FC.
