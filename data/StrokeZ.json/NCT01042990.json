Adaptive physical activity is an exercise model that combines aerobic exercise with balance and gait training in a socially reinforcing group setting. Individualized homework assignments encourage integration of exercise into daily life routines. Our specific aims are:\n\n1. to determine whether APA improves cardiovascular fitness and metabolic health\n2. to measure the effects of APA on gait and balance, ambulatory activity, and ADL function\n3. to determine whether APA affects self-reported outcomes related to self-efficacy, fatigue, and stroke-specific quality of life"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Exercise","Balance","Dynamic Gait","Cardiovascular Fitness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home Exercise Only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants receive education and instruction on a home exercise program which they do on their own, with intermittent encouragement from study personnel.","interventionNames":["Other: Adaptive Physical Activity"]},{"label":"APA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants exercise in a gym setting 3x/week for six months, performing gait and balance exercises along with a progressive walking program.","interventionNames":["Other: Adaptive Physical Activity"]},{"label":"APA+TM","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants exercise in a gym setting 3x/week for six months, performing a combined program of adaptive physical activity (gait and balance training) and progressive treadmill walking.","interventionNames":["Other: Adaptive Physical Activity"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Adaptive Physical Activity","description":"Structured gait, balance, and progressive walking program performed in a group gym setting 3x/week for 6 months","armGroupLabels":["APA","APA+TM","Home Exercise Only"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"VO2 Peak","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 months post-intervention"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 months post-intervention"},{"measure":"Dynamic Gait Index","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 months post intervention"},{"measure":"Step Activity Monitoring","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 months post-intervention"},{"measure":"6 Minute Walks","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 months post-intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Psychosocial questionnaires","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 3 months post-intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
