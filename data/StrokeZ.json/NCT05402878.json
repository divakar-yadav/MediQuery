However, the high rate of crossover in BEST study and the long-term of recruitment in BASICS study influenced the validity of the results.\n\nObjective: To assess the outcomes and prognostic factors of recanalization therapy in patients with BAO, caused by a CTA/MRA/DSA confirmed occlusion of the basilar artery.\n\nStudy design: This is a prospective observational study. Study population: Patients with acute ischemic stroke and a confirmed basilar artery occlusion by CTA/MRA/DSA.\n\nMain study parameters/outcomes: Favorable outcome at day 90 defined as a modified Rankin Score (mRS - functional scale) of 0-3. The estimate will be adjusted for the known prognostic variables age, time from onset to treatment, stroke severity (NIHSS), PC ASPECT and collateral flow and adjusted and unadjusted estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported.","detailedDescription":"Acute basilar artery thrombosis is associated with a poor prognosis. Prevalence of basilar artery occlusion are not known in Vietnam.Various treatments were tried in groups of patients with acute ischemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion, but evidence based was not cleared previous studies. Therefore, we conduct this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recanalization therapies, which included intravenous thrombosis alone, endovascular alone, or bridging IVT and endovascular, in basilar artery occlusion stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION","RECANALISATION
