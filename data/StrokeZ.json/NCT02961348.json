Half of the patients will start NOAC early (within 4 days after stroke onset) while the other half will start late (5-10 days after stroke onset).","detailedDescription":"Oral anticoagulation therapy is well established and highly recommended for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but the optimal time point to start after an acute ischemic stroke is not known.\n\nThe intervention in this study will be timing of treatment onset. The choice of NOAC (i.e. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban) after the acute ischemic stroke is at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nThis study will use the Swedish Stroke Register for enrolment, randomization and follow-up, with additional data linkage from other mandatory national registers. Primary outcome will be assessed at 90 days and secondary outcomes (including all-cause mortality and health economic analyses) and will be assessed at 90 days and up to one year after the index ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Oral anticoagulants (NOAC)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":888,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early start of NOAC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Day 1 to day 4 after ischemic stroke onset","interventionNames":["Other: Early start of NOAC"]},{"label":"Late start of NOAC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Day 5 to day 10 after ischemic stroke onset","interventionNames":["Other: Late start of NOAC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Early start of NOAC","description":"Initiation of NOAC up until day 4 after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation","armGroupLabels":["Early start of NOAC"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Late start of NOAC","description":"Initiation of NOAC between day 5 and day 10 after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation","armGroupLabels":["Late start of NOAC"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite outcome of recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, or all-cause mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent acute ischemic stroke","description":"Defined as a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset lasting at least 24 h (or \\<24 h if following therapeutic intervention, i.e. thrombolysis or thrombectomy, or if the deficit results in death \\< 24 h), occurring \\>24 hours after the index ischemic stroke, irrespective of vascular territory and that is not attributable to edema, brain shift, hemorrhagic transformation, intercurrent illness, hypoxia, or drug toxicity","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (S-ICH)","description":"Defined as a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset lasting at least 24 h with documented intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) on imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).
