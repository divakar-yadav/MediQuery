Eligible participants will be screened and recruited by the research team through daily rounds. After completing the informed consent process, the research team will pull demographic information from the electronic health record (EHR) and REDCAP that includes ethnicity and support system. Participants will complete the Anxiety Screen Questionnaire (GAD-7 ANXIETY SURVEY) and will be provided with information regarding stroke support groups available with additional NYU Langone Health and the American Heart Association internet-based information regarding anxiety reduction (NYU Langone Health Anxiety Reduction Bundle). The participants will be encouraged to attend a stroke support group for 3 months and utilize the NYU Langone Health Anxiety Reduction Bundle provided. At the completion of the intervention (3 months), participants will be provided with the GAD-7 ANXIETY SURVEY again and a survey that includes open-ended questions and a program evaluation by email. Analysis will occur after final data is collected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients discharged following acute care stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participation will last 3 months from enrollment.
