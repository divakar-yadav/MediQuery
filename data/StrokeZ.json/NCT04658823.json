The disease is responsible for stroke and cognitive decline associated with motor disability. The number of incident lacunes, and amount of cerebral atrophy were recently found to have a strong relationship to cognitive decline and disability progression over 3 years in a large sample of patients. Palm tocotrienols has previously shown evidence of therapeutic effect in attenuating the progression of WMH related to sporadic cerebral small vessel disease in a randomized controlled clinical trial. We hypothesize that palm tocotrienols complex (HOV-12020) can reduce the clinical progression in CADASIL."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cadasil"],"keywords":["CADASIL","Tocotrienols","Vitamin E","Vascular","Stroke","Dementia","Cerebral Small Vessel Disease","Cognitive disorder","Neurovascular disease","Hereditary multi-infarct","Cerebrovascular disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blinded","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HOV-12020","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Palm tocotrienols complex Oral softgel capsule (containing 285mg mixed tocotrienols and tocopherol)","interventionNames":["Drug: HOV-12020 (Palm tocotrienols complex)"]},{"label":"PLACEBO","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo Oral Softgel capsule (each capsule containing vitamin E stripped soybean oil)","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"HOV-12020 (Palm tocotrienols complex)","description":"Oral Softgel capsule containing mixed tocotrienols and tocopherol with enhanced absorption delivery system; 1 capsule twice daily","armGroupLabels":["HOV-12020"],"otherNames":["HOV-12020","Palm Vitamin E","Tocotrienols","Tocovid Suprabio"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Oral Softgel capsule containing soybean oil; 1 capsule twice daily","armGroupLabels":["PLACEBO"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of manifestations related to clinical worsening","description":"Occurrence one failure event within 24 months after Baseline.
