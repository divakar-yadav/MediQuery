In fact, according to working hypothesis, proprioceptive inputs with high-intensive bilateral movement training of the hemiplegic arm can improve recovery and plasticity, thus preventing chronic post-stroke pain from occurring within the 3-6 months following stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the most frequent causes of death and disability worldwide. It is accompanied by impaired motor function of the upper extremities in over 69% of patients up to hemiplegia in the following 5 years in 56% of cases. This condition often is characterized by chronic post-stroke pain, difficult to manage and further worsening the patients' quality of life. Post-stroke pain occurs within 3-6 months and aberrant neuroplasticity in the first 3-4 weeks is implicated in its development. Robot-assisted neurorehabilitation using the Automatic Recovery Arm Motility Integrated System (ARAMIS) has proven efficacy in motor function recovery exploiting the movements and the strength of the unaffected arm to drive correct brain re-arrangement. Therefore, the rationale of the ROBOCOP (ROBOtic Care of Post-stroke pain) randomized, double-blind trial for the assessment of the impact of robot-assisted functional and motor recovery on post-stroke pain development is based on the prevention of anomalous plasticity and, hopefully, on the recovery of connectivity in the injured area.\n\nTo this aim, a total of 118 patients with hemiplegic arm due to stroke will be enrolled and randomly allocated with 1:1 ratio to ARAMIS or conventional neurorehabilitation group. After a baseline screening at hospital discharge during subacute period, ARAMIS or conventional rehabilitation will be performed for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint will consist in improvement of the Upper Extremity Subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA-UE), for the body functions of the upper extremity section domain; the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after stroke. The secondary endpoints include no worsening of pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and improvement of Barthel Index (BI) for activities of daily living and of Frenchay activities index (FAI) for physical activity, as well as improvement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters This is the first clinical trial investigating the efficacy of robot-assisted neurorehabilitation using ARAMIS on brain plasticity and re-organization and on post-stroke pain prevention. This study could remarkably improve the quality of life of stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Robotic rehabilitation","Pain","stroke recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This randomized, double-blind, single center trial will recruit subacute hemiplegic patients of any age with hemiparesis of the arm after stroke.

In so doing, the patient is able to replicate the movements of the healthy arm with the paretic arm in synchronous, asynchronous or active-assisted manner. The robot-assisted neurorehabilitation using ARAMIS consists in 60-min sessions for 8 weeks,structured as follows:\n\n* 1 to 4 weeks: asynchronous exercises of repletion by the paretic arm of basic exercises 20 times for a total of 200 repetitions per session;\n* 5 to 8 weeks: replaced by synchronous exercises (100/session) with active-assisted modality.","armGroupLabels":["Aramis Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional therapy","description":"The control group will receive conventional rehabilitation consisting in passive mobilization of upper and lower limbs, coordination respiratory exercises, cardiovascular conditioning in the setting posture, conditioning in the upright posture, exercises for the trunk control.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Group therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment - upper extremity (FMA-UE)","description":"Improvement of Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA-UE) scores.

Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in patients who described their pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).","timeFrame":"up to 6 months after the admission assessment."},{"measure":"Barthel Index (BI)","description":"Improvement of Barthel Index (BI).
