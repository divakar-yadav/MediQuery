To examine the reliability of SWE assessment in the shoulder muscles of persons after a stroke.\n2. To assess if differentiation can be made between the hemiplegic (HP) and non-hemiplegic (NHP) side and between stroke patients and matched healthy volunteers (discriminative validity).\n3. To assess if an immediate effect on the pectoralis major and minor can be measured after applying transversal stretch technique to the pectoralis major muscles (response validity).","detailedDescription":"Stroke patients will be assessed on 2 days with an interval of 3 days (Friday - Monday).\n\nDay 1 (Friday): shear wave velocity (SWV) will be assessed by 2 assessors in randomised order. Each assessor will evaluate SWV of 6 shoulder muscles (m. supraspinatus, m. infraspinatus, m. rhomboid major, m. deltoideus, m. pectoralis major, m. pectoralis minor).\n\nAt the end of the assessment secondary outcome measures will be assessed.\n\nDay 2 (Monday): SWV will be reassessed by assessor 1 to measure test-retest reliability.\n\nPosition of the patient will be changed. SWV of the pectoralis major and minor muscle will be reassessed.\n\nAssessor 2 will perform a transversal stretch of the m. pectoralis major or a passive mobilisation of the hand at the hemiplegic arm of the stroke patients. Assessor 1 will reassess the SWV of the pectoralis major and minor muscle to assess if there is an immediate effect of the intervention. Assessor 1 will be blinded for the intervention.\n\nHealthy controls (matched for age, gender and BMI):\n\nOnly one test day to assess SWV of 6 shoulder muscles. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed after SWE assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Shear wave elastography","Shoulder muscles","Shoulder pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SWE for 6 shoulder muscles will be performed by 2 assessors in randomised order.\n\n* m. supraspinatus\n* m. infraspinatus\n* m. rhomboideus major\n* m. deltoideus\n* m. pectoralis major\n* m. pectoralis minor","interventionNames":["Procedure: SWE assessor 1","Procedure: SWE assessor 2","Procedure: Stretch intervention","Procedure: No stretch intervention"]},{"label":"Healthy controls","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"SWE for 6 shoulder muscles will be performed by 1 assessors.\n\n* m. supraspinatus\n* m. infraspinatus\n* m. rhomboideus major\n* m. deltoideus\n* m. pectoralis major\n* m. pectoralis minor","interventionNames":["Procedure: SWE assessor 1"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"SWE assessor 1","description":"SWE for 6 shoulder muscles will be performed.\n\n* m. supraspinatus\n* m. infraspinatus\n* m. rhomboideus major\n* m. deltoideus\n* m. pectoralis major\n* m. pectoralis minor","armGroupLabels":["Healthy controls","Stroke group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"SWE assessor 2","description":"SWE for 6 shoulder muscles will be performed.\n\n* m. supraspinatus\n* m. infraspinatus\n* m. rhomboideus major\n* m. deltoideus\n* m. pectoralis major\n* m. pectoralis minor","armGroupLabels":["Stroke group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Stretch intervention","description":"Transversal stretch of pectoralis major muscle on the hemiplegic side.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"No stretch intervention","description":"Passive mobilisation of the hemiplegic hand.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"SWV m. supraspinatus","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. supraspinatus","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 1 (test)"},{"measure":"SWV m. supraspinatus","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. supraspinatus","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 2 (retest)"},{"measure":"SWV m. infraspinatus","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. infraspinatus","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 1 (test)"},{"measure":"SWV m. infraspinatus","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. infraspinatus","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 2 (retest)"},{"measure":"SWV m. rhomboideus major","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. rhomboideus major","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 1 (test)"},{"measure":"SWV m. rhomboideus major","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. rhomboideus major","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 2 (retest)"},{"measure":"SWV m. deltoideus","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. deltoideus","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 1 (test)"},{"measure":"SWV m. deltoideus","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. deltoideus","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 2 (retest)"},{"measure":"SWV m. pectoralis major","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. pectoralis major","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 1 (test)"},{"measure":"SWV m. pectoralis major","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. pectoralis major","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 2 (retest)"},{"measure":"SWV m. pectoralis minor","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. pectoralis minor","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 1 (test)"},{"measure":"SWV m. pectoralis minor","description":"Shear wave velocity of the m. pectoralis minor","timeFrame":"Single point of assessment on day 2 (retest)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Demographic variables","description":"Age, gender, weight, height, dominance, date of birth, stroke date, type of stroke, side of paresis","timeFrame":"Baseline assessment day 1"},{"measure":"Passive range of motion of shoulder","description":"Goniometric measurement of shoulder flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation (degrees)","timeFrame":"Baseline assessment day 1"},{"measure":"Spasticity shoulder muscles","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale (minimum 0 -
