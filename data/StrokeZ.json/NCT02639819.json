Subjects will receive 5 grams of intravenous ɛ-aminocaproic acid over 1 hour, followed by the same at 1 mg/hour for 23 hours. Comupted tomography (CT) head will be done at 24 hours in order to follow hematoma size. Electrocardiogram, lower extremity venous Doppler and NIHSS will also be done at 24 hours. The patient will be followed in the clinic 30-90 days post discharge for functional status."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke","Cerebrovascular"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study drug","interventionNames":["Drug: ɛ-Aminocaproic Acid"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ɛ-Aminocaproic Acid","description":"Intervention: intravenous ε-Aminocaproic Acid within 3 hours of symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["Treatment"],"otherNames":["Amicar","Aminocaproic Acid"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hematoma volume","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Lower extermity deep vein thrombosis on venous duplex ultrasound","timeFrame":"24-48 hours"},{"measure":"Evidence of cardiac ischemia on the electrocardiogram","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"National Insitutes of Health Stroke Scale score","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale score","timeFrame":"30 Days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
