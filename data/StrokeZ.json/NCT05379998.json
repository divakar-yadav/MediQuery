Evidence regarding the comparison of these two techniques is sparse and is based on different clinical experiences and a less number of studies with limited methodological design. There has been no work regarding the long term effects of these two techniques in improving lower limb motor function in Hemiplegic stroke patients. This study will contribute to describing the long term effects of these techniques on gait, motor function and quality of life in hemiplegic stroke patients and compare the effectiveness of both techniques. A total of 54 patients diagnosed with Hemiplegic stroke will be selected for the collection of data according to the inclusion criteria. Patients will be divided into two groups, Group A and Group B. Group A will receive sciatic nerve mobilization (sliding technique) and Group B will receive Proprioceptive neuromuscular mobilization Hold relax technique 3 days a week for 30 mins per day for 6 weeks. Sciatic nerve mobilizations (sliding technique) will be performed for a duration of 1 minute each for 6 such sets with 60 seconds rest period followed by every set. The Hold Relax Technique of Hamstring will be performed with each hold period lasting for 10 seconds followed by a relaxation phase of 10-15 seconds for 10 repetitions. Data will be collected at baseline, after 3weeks and at 6 weeks after intervention from both groups. Gait will be measured using TUG (Timed up and go), Quality of life will be measured using the Urdu version of SS-QOL(stroke-specific quality of life)and lower limb motor function will be measured using fugl Meyer scale(lower extremity)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegic Stroke"],"keywords":["Neural mobilization","PNF hold relax","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"This will be a single blinded study.
