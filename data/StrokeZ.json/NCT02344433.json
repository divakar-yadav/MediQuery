In this study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of using VICKY to the existing My Family Health Portrait (MFHP) tool for collecting family health history information among an underserved primary care patient population. The primary aims of the study are to 1) evaluate the efficacy of VICKY versus MFHP for collecting accurate family health histories and 2) determine whether accuracy varies as a function of health literacy. This project will obtain validation data on the efficacy of both VICKY and MFHP for collecting accurate family history data among an underserved patient population, in two languages (English and Spanish). The study will determine whether a virtual counselor can overcome many of the existing barriers to using traditional web-based family history tools."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Disease","Stroke","Diabetes","Cancer"],"keywords":["Family health history","Genetic literacy","Health literacy","Relational agent","Common chronic conditions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":279,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VICKY","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Relational agent, \"virtual counselor\" for collecting family health history (VICKY: VIrtual Counselor for Knowing Your Family History).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: VICKY"]},{"label":"MFHP","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Online family health history collection tool (MFHP: My Family Health Portrait).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: MFHP"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"VICKY","description":"Relational agent/virtual counselor","armGroupLabels":["VICKY"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"MFHP","description":"US Surgeon General's family history tool","armGroupLabels":["MFHP"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of health conditions id'd (interview w/ genetic counselor gold standard. health conditions id'd by VICKY or MFHP id'd by genetic counselor (true +) divided by health conditions captured by genetic counselor (false - plus true +)","description":"Sensitivity will be calculated using an interview with a genetic counselor as the gold standard.
