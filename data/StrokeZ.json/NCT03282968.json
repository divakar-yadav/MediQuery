In both groups, the program with last for five days; walking and balance will be assessed before and after the program. Both groups will receive regular neurophysiotherapy; in addition, the experimental group will exercise each day by playing REWIRE games, while the control group will perform standing balance exercises.","detailedDescription":"Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in the appropriate section.
