The number of patients undergoing LAAC treatment tends to increase. LAAC procedures effectively reduce the number of strokes, with a significant reduction in the risk of bleeding compared to oral anticoagulants. However, although LAAC treatments alone have a low risk of perioperative stroke, some patients may experience incidents of silent brain ischemia (SBI). The distant effect of SBI may be cognitive deterioration, the onset of dementia syndromes, as well as depression.\n\nPurpose of the study: The study aims to assess the effect of the use of neuroprotection in transcutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation on the risk of perioperative SBI and associated cognitive impairment and depression.\n\nMethodology: The planned study is a prospective, multicentre, randomized, and double-blind intervention trial. Neuroprotection introduced from arterial access will be used in the LAAC treatment study group. In the control group, LAAC treatments will be performed without neuroprotection. Two hundred forty patients are planned to be enrolled with indications for stroke prevention due to atrial fibrillation. The analysis will include data obtained from DW MRI images, neurological evaluation results along with NIHSS-scale scores, results of cognitive evaluation tests (MoCA, COWAT, TMT A\\&B), and test of mood disorders (HADS Scale), as well as results of the EQ-5D-5L quality of life assessment questionnaire. It is planned to observe patients participating in the study for 24 months after LAAC procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Silent Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Depression"],"keywords":["cerebral protection","left atrial appendage occlusion","atrial fibrillation","silent brain ischemia","cognitive impairment","depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"In order to blind the radial artery will also be punctured in control group and an aortography will be performed.
