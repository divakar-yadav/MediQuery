Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke, but when transient (paroxysmal) it may remain undiagnosed. Recent data suggest that occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be identified in patients with cryptogenic strokes using prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitors.\n\nThe investigators designed this study pursuing the following goals:\n\n1. To determine the prevalence of occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke using long-term mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry.\n2. To compare this prevalence to that found in a control group with stroke of known, non-cardioembolic cause.\n3. To look for clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and imaging data that serve as risk factors for occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke.\n4. To examine the utility of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, a relatively new diagnostic tool, in the evaluation of patients with cryptogenic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":132,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cryptogenic stroke","description":"Patients with stroke of unknown cause after comprehensive conventional evaluation","interventionNames":["Other: Mobile cardiac rhythm monitoring"]},{"label":"Stroke of known cause","description":"Patients with stroke of known cause determined by comprehensive conventional evaluation","interventionNames":["Other: Mobile cardiac rhythm monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mobile cardiac rhythm monitoring","description":"Continuous ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring using the CardioNet MCOT device","armGroupLabels":["Cryptogenic stroke","Stroke of known cause"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of Atrial Fibrillation","description":"Documented presence of atrial fibrillation detected by the monitoring device and independently confirmed by a board-certified cardiologist","timeFrame":"21 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to first episode of atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"Within monitoring period (3 weeks)"},{"measure":"Atrial Fibrillation Load","description":"Total time that the patient had atrial fibrillation during the monitoring period","timeFrame":"Within monitoring period (3 weeks)"},{"measure":"Adverse events related to mobile cardiac monitoring","timeFrame":"21 days"},{"measure":"Symptomatic status of episode of atrial fibrillation","description":"Presence or absence of symptoms related to the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"21 days"},{"measure":"Longest duration of episode of atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"21 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke or TIA within previous 3 months\n* Stroke work up including: EKG, serum lipids, serum TSH, TTE or TEE, brain CT and/or MRI, Vascular Evaluation of head and neck using any combination of ultrasound, MRA, CTA, and conventional angiography\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Documented history of atrial fibrillation or flutter\n* PFO closure planned before conclusion of the monitoring period\n* Incomplete stroke work up","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with stroke or TIA confirmed by a vascular neurologist within previous 3 months with complete evaluation for stroke causes according to current standards.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"27809773","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Baturova MA, Sheldon SH, Carlson J, Brady PA, Lin G, Rabinstein AA, Friedman PA, Platonov PG.
