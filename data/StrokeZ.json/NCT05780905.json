The study will randomize subjects with diabetes to either semaglutide or matching placebo. Magnetic resonance images will be primary endpoint measured at baseline and at one year to assess effect of this FDA approved medication.\n\nGiven the available evidence supporting the neuroprotective effect of this drug class and stroke reduction with semaglutide, and our preliminary data showing that T2D had significantly reduced total number of distal arterial branches in the brain than non-T2D, we expect treatment with semaglutide will be associated with improved intracranial blood flow condition.","detailedDescription":"Our preliminary data showed that T2D had significantly reduced total number of distal branches as assessed using our quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) feature measurement method (iCafe) than non-T2D. This reduction represents a decrease in intracranial blood flow condition and can be an indication for ischemia. Clinical trial showed that semaglutide reduces stroke incidence in T2D. We propose to conduct a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study to investigate the biological basis of the observed stroke reduction with semaglutide by demonstrating semaglutide can improve intracranial blood flow condition and reduce bloodbrain barrier (BBB) permeability. Our working hypothesis is that it is known that semaglutide has beneficial effects on T2D, therefore, it improves endothelial function for a better cerebral flow condition. However, semaglutide may also improve cerebral flow independently from glucose lowering. Together, the improved cerebral flow condition results in stroke reduction. In order to investigate the independent effects of semaglutide on intracranial blood flow condition and BBB permeability, we will have a designated diabetes care specialist unblinded to the study randomization to carry out glucose management to achieve HbA1C\\<7.5% for both treatment groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Stroke (CVA) or Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled MRI study","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects randomized to placebo for 1 year.","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"Active","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects randomized to semaglutide for 1 year.","interventionNames":["Drug: Semaglutide Auto-Injector"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Semaglutide Auto-Injector","description":"Subjects have an equal chance of receiving semaglutide or placebo.
