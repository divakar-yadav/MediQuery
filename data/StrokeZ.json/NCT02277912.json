MRI based navigation is used to determine the exact locations for stimulation.","detailedDescription":"Central post stroke pain is often very resistant to treatment. TMS has been shown to be a promising tool in treating difficult pain conditions. The best sites for stimulation are still not known and navigation has been used only in few studies.\n\nThe aim is to evaluate the analgesic effects of Navigated Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( nrTMS ) on pain in a three armed crossover study. The navigation is done by using magnetic resonance imaging and stereotactic camera system. The three arms include stimulation to M1, S2 and sham stimulation to M1. 10 Hz repetitive stimulation is given to a specified location once a day 5 days a week for two weeks in each of the three arms. A months washout period is kept between each arm of the study.\n\nPain and other variables are followed before, during and after the study for 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Central Post Stroke Pain"],"keywords":["ICH","Stroke","Navigated","Placebo","TMS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Repetitive navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the motor cortex","interventionNames":["Device: navigated rTMS of motor cortex"]},{"label":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Repetitive navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the secondary somatosensory cortex","interventionNames":["Device: navigated rTMS of somatosensory cortex 2"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention: Repetitive sham Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with SHAM block of the motor cortex","interventionNames":["Device: SHAM rTMS with SHAM block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"navigated rTMS of motor cortex","description":"Navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex ( 10 Hz ) ,5 daily sessions per week for two weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation I"],"otherNames":["Navigated","rTMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"navigated rTMS of somatosensory cortex 2","description":"Navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the secondary somatosensory cortex ( 10 Hz ), 5 daily sessions per week for two weeks","armGroupLabels":["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation II"],"otherNames":["Navigated","rTMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SHAM rTMS with SHAM block","description":"Repetitive SHAM transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex ( 10Hz) 5 daily sessions per week for two weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Sham Stimulation"],"otherNames":["Navigated","rTMS","Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in average pain compared to baseline","description":"Patients will keep a pain diary for one week before stimulation and for two weeks after the stimulation.
