This study will involve an electronic medical record (EMR) chart audit, augmented by a manual review of hospital and other pertinent medical records, as necessary.","detailedDescription":"The DECIDE study will identify whether cardiovascular complication rates (the composite rate of myocardial infarction (MI), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral revascularization, and peripheral amputation) are lower in patients who participate in managed diabetes care by ADEC in comparison to provincial and national rates. Comparison statistics will be provided by the Institute of Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Atlas 2003 and other Diabetes studies such as the 2005 DICE study. Complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy will be documented, along with hospitalization rates and all cause mortality. Clinical outcomes relevant to diabetes management such as blood pressure and lipids will also be compared."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disease Management","Diabetes Complications","Diabetic Vascular Complications","Diabetic Neuropathy","Diabetic Nephropathy","Diabetic Retinopathy"],"keywords":["amputation","angina","angiography","angioplasty","arterial disease","artery disease","bypass","CABG","cad","carotid","cerebral accident","CHF","CRF","CVA","endarterectomy","heart attack","heart failure","infarct","kidney disease","kidney failure","laser","nephropathy","neuropathy","pad","PCI","percutaneous coronary","percutaneous transluminal","pvd","renal failure","retinopathy","revascularization","schemia","stenosis","stent","stroke","transient","ulcer","vascular disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1213,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ADEC <6months","description":"Patients new to the ADEC program who will be provided the ADEC interventions (prospective study)","interventionNames":["Other: ADEC Program"]},{"label":"ADEC >6months","description":"Patients who have been with the ADEC program as early as 2002 (coincides with ADEC's EMR initiation date) who continue to be provided the ADEC interventions (combined retrospective/prospective study)","interventionNames":["Other: ADEC Program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"ADEC Program","description":"Interventions (managed diabetes care) employed by the ADEC Program include: diabetes education, nutrition care, individual and group counseling sessions, foot care, and insulin and oral diabetes medication adjustments with a signed medical directive.
