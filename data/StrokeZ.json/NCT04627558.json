However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset Function Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of stroke. For this reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function Test in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"While the ambulation ability is completely lost in some patients after stroke, impaired balance reactions and increased postural oscillations cause an increase in the fear of falling and the risk of falling in stroke patients. These disturbances cause stroke patients to make more effort to balance while standing. Balance assessment performed in individuals with stroke determines the risk of falling and is important in preventing complications that may develop due to loss of balance.\n\nDubousset Functional Test (DFT); A conceptually practical four-component assessment test has been proposed by Dr. Jean Dubousset to assess the functional capacity of adult individuals. The validity of the test was made in individuals with spinal deformity. DFT; It consists of four components: getting up from a chair without arms and walking 5 meters forward and backward, descending and climbing steps, transition from standing to sitting on the ground, and the dual task test in which the individual walks while counting down from 50 at the same time. In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional performance in stroke. However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset Function Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of stroke. For this reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function Test in stroke patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Syndrome","Balance; Distorted","Walking, Difficulty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients, balance assessment","description":"Dubousset Function Test, 3-m backwards walk test, timed up and go test,Tinnetti Balance and Gait Test, Berg BalanceTest, Functional Reach Test","interventionNames":["Other: stroke patients, balance assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"stroke patients, balance assessment","description":"validity relability dubousset functional test","armGroupLabels":["stroke patients, balance assessment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dubousset Function Test","description":"The four components of the DFT included (1) the Up Walking Test: participants rose without assistance from a and seated position in a chair that did not have arms, walked 5 meters (500 cm) forward before stopping, walked backwards 5 meters, and sat again without assistance; (2) the Steps Test: from a starting position 50 cm away, volunteers climbed three stairs, turned around on the third step (top), and walked down the three steps; (3) Down and Sitting Test: from a standing position, participants sat on the ground and stood up again, using assistance as needed; (4) Dual-Tasking Test: participants walked 5 meters forward, turned around, and walked 5 meters back to the starting position while performing a working memory test (counting down from 50 by intervals of 2).","timeFrame":"First day"},{"measure":"timed up and go test","description":"A standard chair is used for testing.
