HR (Fig. 1A) and systolic BP (Figure 1B) significantly increased between 0 min and 10 min (P = 0.041) and between -10 min and 10 min (P = 0.073), respectively; these two variables decreased steadily and returned to the baseline. Diastolic BP (Fig. 1B) showed no significant change after mannitol infusion (P = 0.102). CVP (Fig. 1C) significantly increased between -20 min and 0 min (P \\< 0.001) and constantly decreased after 0 min, which remained below the baseline between 30 min and 60 min. CI (Fig. 1D) and SVI (Fig. 1E) showed a significant persistent increase between -20 min to 0 min (P \\< 0.001) and between -20 min and 10 min (P \\< 0.001), respectively. SVV exhibited a dipper-type change shown as a significant decrease between -20 min and 0 min and a significant increase between 0 min and 60 min (P \\< 0.001), which returned to the baseline after 20 min."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Craniotomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"cardiac index","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"stroke volume index","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"stroke volume variation","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"systolic pressure","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"central venous pressure","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"heart rate","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"peripheral vascular resistance","timeFrame":"during the procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"base excess","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"lactic acid","timeFrame":"during the procedure"},{"measure":"DO2I","timeFrame":"during the procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* The inclusion criteria were: being aged between 16 and 70 years;\n* with a body mass index of 18-25 kg/m2;\n* with a physical status classified as ASA class I or II;\n* and scheduled for elective craniotomy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any patient would be excluded from this study if the patient had complicating serious coagulopathy, hepatorenal insufficiency, aortic regurgitation, or cardiac arrhythmia;\n* had a previous history of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation;\n* exhibited systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥100 mmHg, or heart rate ≥ 100 bpm on operating room admission;\n* or rejected to participate in this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"scheduled for elective craniotomy","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M11032","name":"Mannitol","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"NaAg","name":"Natriuretic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
