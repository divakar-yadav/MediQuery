The investigators propose to leverage the recruitment, DNA, RNA-seq and baseline advanced neuroimaging cohort of ROSE to obtain long-term neuroimaging and identical assessments longitudinally to address critical questions regarding the progressive decline of patients 12 to 24 months post intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with long term cognitive follow-up to 36 months on average. This proposal would represent the largest, and longest advanced neuroimaging and RNA-sequencing evaluation after ICH to date.","detailedDescription":"The investigators propose to leverage the recruitment, DNA, RNA-seq and baseline advanced neuroimaging cohort of ROSE to obtain long-term neuroimaging and identical assessments longitudinally to address critical questions regarding the progressive decline of patients 12 to 24 months post ICH with long term cognitive follow-up to 36 months on average.
