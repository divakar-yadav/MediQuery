It is essential to an effective assessment of the balance.\n\nObjective: The purpose of the present project adapt and verify the validity of the scale MiniBESTest, version of the BESTest, in patients with BDA in subacute and chronic stage, since that is postulated as a brief tool and covering the peculiarities of the specific alterations of the patient after suffering brain damage.\n\nMethodology: Between September 2019 and December 2020 will be transcultural adaptation to the BDA and validation of psychometric scale Mini-BESTest in three phases. 60 subjects who receive treatment in the center of attention State reference to brain damage (CEADAC), together with the comunidad de Madrid private neurological rehabilitation centers will be recruited.\n\nResults: validity and reliability parameters shall be calculated by means of descriptive statistics for each item of the scales and the set of scale score. You will also analyze the internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, the interclass correlation coefficient will be used to determine the reliability, and the items will be scanned with the Pearson coefficient: \\> 0.20, among other parameters.","detailedDescription":"Marta Fernández Hontoria, physiotherapist at the State Reference Center of Attention to Brain Injury (CEADAC), will develop, together with her team formed by Cristina Lirio Romero and María Torres Lacomba of the Department of Physiotherapy at the University of Alcalá, a cross-cultural adaptation to the Spanish population with Adquired Brain Injury (ABI) and psychometric validation of the Mini-BESTest scale. Previously, the author of the scale has been asked for consent. The study will take place at the CEADAC. After receiving the approval of the Ethics and Clinical Research Committee of the University of Alcalá (Madrid), it is proposed to implement the study between September 2019 and May 2020. A minimum of 100 adults, aged between 18 and 65, will be recruited subacute or chronic state after suffering brain damage. The sample size conforms to COSMIN recommendations.\n\nAfter verifying that there are no parallel studies on the subject in progress, the possible participants will be informed of the development of the investigation (ANNEX 1), who must sign the informed consent (ANNEX 2) before being recruited into the study. In addition, a coding sheet (ANNEX 3) of the participants will be filled in so that from now on the data related to the proper name does not appear but with a number that ensures the protection of their data.\n\nThe participants will be all users of CEADAC and the selection criteria to enter to participate in the study will be: adults who had suffered a ABI at least 2 months ago, that their disability before suffering it was less than or equal to three on the scale modified by Rankin, who have an absence of cognitive impairment according to the Minimental State Examination scale, that is, a score in it greater than 24, without previous diseases that alter the balance, that were clinically stable and without fever, with the ability to walk with help technical or without it, and that they gave their informed consent.\n\nOn the other hand, those people with medical contraindications for physical tests (acute musculoskeletal or peripheral nervous system disorders), who did not understand the instructions, severe aphasias or with subjects with acute processes of any added pathology will be excluded.\n\nThe study was developed in 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1: Transcultural adaptation process. Phase 2: Pre-Test: collected , as well as the ease of interpretation of the results.\n\nPhase 3: Psychometric validation process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Damage"],"keywords":["Brain Damage Acquired","BDA in subacute and chronic stage","BESTest","Mini-BESTest","Balance","Postural control","Brain Stroke","Stroke","Cross-cultural adaptation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Test-retest Reliability","description":"the overall consistency measures the homogeneity of the scale and the interdependence of the items, indicating the relationship between them.\n\nTo determine test-retest test reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used.
