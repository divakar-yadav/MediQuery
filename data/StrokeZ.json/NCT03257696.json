Stroke patients, who have language disorders, have understanding difficulties, but also have difficulties in expressing their needs and in being understood. Available tools do not allow a professional consensus on the assessment of patients' ability to answer reliably to questions asked by caregivers. The investigators propose an answer reliability assessment tool based on yes or no questions. The goal of the present study is to define an optimal score for defining the test positivity, as a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and by emphasizing the negative predictive value.","detailedDescription":"In France, about 130,000 persons per year are victims of stroke. Thirty percent of the victims suffer from aphasia during the acute phase. These language impairments have an impact on caregiving. In the context of post-stroke aphasia, the most relevant means of verbal communication is closed-ended questioning. However, the available tools do not allow a professional consensus and the comprehensive assessment tools for aphasia do not provide any indication of the reliability of patients' answers. The investigators have developed a tool, the yes/no questionnaire that consists of 10 closed-ended questions designed to assess the patient's ability to provide a coherent answer. During one year, successive patients taken care in the neurovascular unit at la Rochelle hospital will be assessed for eligibility to the study and their relative will be informed and ask for consent. Aphasic patients will therefore answer the yes/no questionnaire. Based on the speech therapist evaluation, patients will be classified as \"reliable respondent\" or \"unreliable respondent\"."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":152,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Close-ended questionnaire","description":"Yes/no questionnaire used in order to identify \"reliable respondent\" and \"unreliable respondent\""}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"YNQ Score","description":"The Yes/No questionnaire consists in 10 closed-ended questions designed to assess the patient's ability to provide a coherent answer.\n\nIt was designed with questions that are very easy to answer, with the following constraints:\n\n* The questionnaire use only the auditory/verbal channel .\n* The questions ask only about personal data because they are less ambiguous.\n* The syntactical construction of the questions is very simple.\n* Apart from the use of personal data very familiar to the participants, the other nouns in the closed questions are very frequent (according to a lexical database).\n* The length of the questions was limited to seven words.\n* With the exception of two questions, each yes-response question had a no-response equivalent, as in some existing tests.\n\nA score of zero indicates a wrong answer to all questions.
