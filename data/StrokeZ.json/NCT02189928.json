Stroke is the first cause of acquired disability, and the 2nd cause of dementia and death. The only approved treatment in the first 4.5 hour is intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis (Actilyse ®) whose objective is recanalization of occluded artery and reperfusion of the brain parenchyma. Few patients are treated (1-5%) and they keep disability in 50-60% of cases. This handicap is mainly correlated to the final infarct size. The objective of neuroprotective treatments is to reduce the final size of the cerebral infarction.\n\nThe per-conditioning remote ischemic (Per-CID) showed a neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia by reducing the final size of cerebral infarction animal models. The per-CID corresponds, in cases of cerebral ischemia, to iterative ischemia realization of a member with a cuff. In humans, the per-CID has shown a cardioprotective effect in a randomized control trial involving 250 patients within 6 first hours of myocardial infarction and candidate for primary angioplasty."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"With per-CID protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Usual care patients (thrombolysis or not ) with remote ischemic per-conditioning using an electronic tourniquet .","interventionNames":["Device: Lower limb tourniquet"]},{"label":"Without per-CID protocol","type":"OTHER","description":"Usual care patients (thrombolysis or not).","interventionNames":["Other: Usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Lower limb tourniquet","description":"Lower limb tourniquet will be put on half thigh.
