The studies found that the contralesional motion cortex has a compensatory effect on the realization of the motor function of the affected side-the compensatory model, and the degree of compensation will change as the function changes. The optimal neural regulation strategies under different models are opposite, so it is important to accurately evaluate which of the two models plays the leading role. And functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may accurately and quickly assess cortical function in order to determine the degree of participation of the contralesional motion cortex. We propose that the dynamic individualized strategy which adjust the rTMS parameters promptly based on the results of fNIRS will be better than the traditional stimulation strategy. This project will apply a blinded-assessment randomized controlled trial. The test group selects either the high-frequency rTMS to the contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) or the low-frequency rTMS to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) based on the lateralization index of the PMd measured by fNIRS. And the control group will always be given low-frequency rTMS to contralesional M1. The difference in the improvement of upper limb function between the two groups of patients was compared."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Individualized rTMS strategy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The individualized strategy will adjust the rTMS parameters promptly based on the results of fNIRS.
