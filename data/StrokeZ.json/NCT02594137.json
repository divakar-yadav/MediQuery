In all cases, a large trauma flap (i.e. large reverse question mark starting from the tragus and extending to the midline) was performed. Skin, galea and muscle layers were elevated according to surgeon preference. Thus a wide (at least 12x15cm) craniotomy was performed and the temporal bone was removed until flush with the middle fossa floor. After dural opening, watertight duraplasty with pericranium or an artificial graft (at surgeon's discretion) was performed in the control group, while no watertight duraplasty was performed in the test group, and exposed brain parenchyma was covered with SurgicelÂ®. Usual closure was then performed. Patients were then monitored daily by evaluators blinded to the randomization (control or test group) from the date of surgery until hospital discharge or death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Edema","Craniocerebral Trauma","Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"],"keywords":["Decompressive craniectomy","Brain Edema"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":58,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Without Watertight Duraplasty","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After standard craniectomy (12x15cm) and dural opening, the \"intervention\", which is to not perform watertight duraplasty is carried out.
