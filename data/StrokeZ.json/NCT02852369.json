Repeated target measures of accelerometry and level of confidence to be analyzed throughout the study. Change scores from standardized assessments to be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up time periods.","detailedDescription":"Hemiparesis following a stroke frequently leads to \"learned non-use\" of the weaker arm and hand. Task oriented training has been suggested as a contemporary neurorehabilitation technique. A single-subject AB series design with a follow-up was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a task oriented training program administered in participants' homes. This intervention, Task Oriented Training at Home (TOTE Home), incorporated current experience-dependent plasticity aspects modeled after the Acquired Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP) protocol parameters and principles of task oriented training as suggested by Lang and Birkenmeier in 2014. Repeated measures of accelerometry and level of confidence on a priority task were analyzed with visual analysis of changes in level, trend, and slope. Change scores from standardized assessments for the upper extremity, Motor Activity Log, Stroke Impact Scale question of recovery, Functional Test for the Hemiparetic Upper Extremity, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure were evaluated on data collected at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up time periods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Task Oriented Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention administered during each of the training sessions was modeled after the protocol outlined in Winstein et al.
