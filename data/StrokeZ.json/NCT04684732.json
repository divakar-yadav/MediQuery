The primary purpose of this study is to provide a clear understanding of the effect of creatinine clearance on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Apixaban among Thai patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. To assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Apixaban, This study will enroll 30 subjects who meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nThe second part of this study will retrospectively determine the occurrent of clinical outcome between patients who were prescribed apixaban dose concordant and discordant to the drug leaflet. A total of 241 subjects will be recruited. The follow up period will begin from the time of initiation of apixaban until occurrent of stoke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, bleeding, or death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Apixaban","Pharmacokinetic","Pharmacodynamic","Cardioembolic stroke","Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":241,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Apixaban dose concordant to leaflet","description":"Patients who were prescribed apixaban dose concordant to apixaban leaflet approved by Thai FDA"},{"label":"Apixaban dose discordant to leaflet","description":"Patients who were prescribed apixaban dose discordant to apixaban leaflet approved by Thai FDA"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Steady state area under the concentration-time curve from pre-dose to 12 hours post-dose (AUC(0-12)) of Apixaban","description":"AUC(0-12) is measured by plasma concentration of apixaban over time.
