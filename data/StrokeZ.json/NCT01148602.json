Using an organizational behaviour intervention (a large stopwatch), we will post a visual cue to remind all parties that \"time is brain\". We hypothesize that this simple visual cue will improve door-to-CT scan times and door-to-needle treatment times, and thus improve treatment response, and reduce adverse events.","detailedDescription":"We will construct a large, \"in-your-face\" red LED stopwatch-clock that is the intervention. The clock will be attached to the stretcher of patients presenting for hyperacute stroke treatment (consideration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment at the moment of their Emergency department arrival. This will act as a constant visual reminder to all team members (physicians, RN's, CT technologists) of the urgency of the situation. The study will be a block randomization, by week of presentation. All patients presenting during \"on\" weeks will have a stopwatch timer with them during the hyperacute stroke workup. During \"off\" weeks, the clocks will not be used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute stroke","Emergency departments","Quality Improvement","Improved Processes","tPA","door-to-needle","door-to-treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3452,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"'Off Clock'","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Stopwatch timers will NOT be used for \"off clock\" weeks, so patients presenting with hyperacute stroke will be managed normally without the visual timer."},{"label":"'On Clock\"","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"LED stopwatch-clock timers will be posted for all patients presenting during \"ON clock\" weeks.
