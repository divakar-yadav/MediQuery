Motor learning involves not only improvement during practice but also improvement between sessions, known as consolidation of learning. Consolidation of learning depends on good sleep quality. However, there is growing evidence that sleep is disrupted after stroke, and it was recently shown that patients with poorer sleep show slower recovery of function and worse motor outcomes. This might occur because sleep disruption impairs consolidation directly or might reflect other factors that influence both sleep and clinical outcomes. This study aims to test whether the relationship between sleep disruption and clinical outcomes after stroke depends on consolidation of motor learning.\n\nIn people with stroke affecting the upper limb, the investigators will (1) test whether sleep measures in the sub-acute phase explains variation in clinical motor outcomes, taking into account recovery potential (as per the PREP2 algorithm(Predict REcovery Potential; www.presto.auckland.ac.nz)), demographic factors (age and sex) and other covariates as required (e.g. stroke severity, presence of sleep disorders, mood, physical activity), and (2) test whether this relationship is mediated by variation in behavioural measures of overnight motor consolidation.\n\nThe design is a longitudinal observational study. Participants will be recruited within 1 week of stroke onset from stroke wards. At baseline (â‰¤ 7 days post-stroke), the investigators will use the PREP2 algorithm (www.presto.auckland.ac.nz) to ascertain expected upper limb recovery potential. This involves an assessment of arm movement and, for some participants, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to assess corticospinal tract integrity. The investigators will also record participant demographics, stroke severity (National Institute for Health Stroke Scale; NIHSS), and medications.\n\nAt approximately 1 month post-stroke the investigators will obtain sleep measures (actigraphy, electroencephalography, and questionnaires), assess mood (questionnaire) and test for motor consolidation (using an upper limb motor learning task). The investigators will also record medications, stroke severity (modified Rankin Scale questionnaire), and assess the possible presence of sleep disorders (sleep screening questionnaires), physical activity (actigraphy). The investigators will collect information about how much, if any, motor rehabilitation and sleep therapy the participants have received (questionnaire).\n\nAt 6 months post-stroke the investigators will obtain sleep measures (actigraphy, and questionnaire) and assess motor outcomes (upper limb ability, whole body motor impairment, hand dexterity, and mobility). The investigators will also record medications and assess mood (questionnaire), stroke severity (modified Rankin Scale questionnaire), physical activity (actigraphy), and information about how much, if any, motor rehabilitation and sleep therapy the participants have had (questionnaire)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Motor Consolidation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sleep fragmentation at 1-month","description":"Assessed using actigraphy (wearable activity monitor) over 7-nights (more fragmentation indicates worse sleep).","timeFrame":"1 month post-stroke"},{"measure":"Symptoms of insomnia at 1-month","description":"Assessed using the Sleep Condition Indicator, a questionnaire assessing self-reported insomnia symptoms (range 0-32, higher scores indicate fewer symptoms of insomnia)","timeFrame":"1 month post-stroke"},{"measure":"Upper limb ability","description":"Assessed using the Action Research Arm Test (range 0-57, higher score indicates better upper limb ability)","timeFrame":"6 month post-stroke"},{"measure":"Behavioural motor consolidation","description":"Assessed as change in motor performance on a sequential button pressing task (movement time, in seconds) from training to retest","timeFrame":"1 month post-stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Whole body motor impairment","description":"Assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, range 0-100 (higher score indicates better functional mobility)","timeFrame":"6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Hand dexterity","description":"Assessed using the Nine Hole Peg Test, scored as the number of pegs placed in 30 seconds (greater number of pegs indicates better hand dexterity)","timeFrame":"6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Mobility","description":"Assessed using the Rivermead Mobility Index, range 0-15 (higher score indicates better functional mobility)","timeFrame":"6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Estimated Total Sleep Time","description":"Assessed using actigraphy (wearable activity monitor) over 7-nights","timeFrame":"1 and 6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Wake After Sleep Onset","description":"Assessed using actigraphy (wearable activity monitor) over 7-nights (higher amount of wake after sleep onset indicates worse sleep)","timeFrame":"1 and 6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Symptoms of insomnia at 6-months","description":"Assessed using the Sleep Condition Indicator, a questionnaire assessing self-reported insomnia symptoms (range 0-32, higher scores indicate fewer symptoms of insomnia)","timeFrame":"6 months post-stroke"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Electroencephalography (EEG) Sleep Measures","description":"At home electroencephalography (EEG) headband for assessing sleep measures (e.g. sleep spindle amplitude, spindle density, sleep staging, cross-frequency coupling)","timeFrame":"1 month post-stroke"},{"measure":"Mood (Depression)","description":"Assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (8-item), range 0-24 (higher values indicate more depressive symptoms)","timeFrame":"1 and 6 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea","description":"Assessed using the STOP BANG questionnaire, range 0-8 (higher values indicate higher risk)","timeFrame":"1 month post-stroke"},{"measure":"Presence of Sleep Disorders","description":"Assessed using the Sleep Disorders Screening questionnaire.
