This study will examine the clinical features and longitudinal course of CADASIL. Outcome measures include neuropsychological profile, neuroimaging, genetics, blood biomarkers, and retinal imaging.","detailedDescription":"Using clinical examination, questionnaires, neuropsychological evaluation, brain MRI, blood sample evaluation and retinal imaging, we aim to characterise the clinical profile and progression of CADASIL in an Australian cohort.\n\nThis is multi-centre observational cohort study currently based at six sites (clinics, hospitals and universities) across three states in Australia (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland). The multidisciplinary team aims to be the first to develop an Australian cohort of CADASIL which will contribute to global efforts and understanding of the disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cadasil"],"keywords":["CADASIL","Clinical Research","Genetics","Cognition","Neuroimaging","Blood markers","Retinal imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CADASIL cohort"},{"label":"Control Cohort"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Online Medical Questionnaire","description":"Includes questions on participant's medical history (CADASIL and other), family history, and medication use.
