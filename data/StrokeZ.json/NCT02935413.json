Because it is possible that such therapy may be more effective during the early recovery phase after the stroke and can reach patients during the rehabilitation phase, investigators wished to explore the applicability, efficacy and safety of early intervention with a combined tDCS/VRT treatment.\n\nSeven post-acute stroke homonymous hemianopia patients were assigned to 10 sessions of combined tDCS (2mA, 10 daily sessions of 15-20 min) and VRT. The primary outcome criterion was the pre-post change in perimetric detection thresholds in percent. The results were compared to 7 age and stroke lesion matched controls of our patient data pool who received standard rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemianopia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"group receiving complete treatment of transcranial direct current stimulation","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]},{"label":"Standard rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard rehabilitation procedures","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Standard rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"Device: verum tDCS real transcranial direct current stimulation,10 sessions, 2mA for 20 minutes Behavioral: VRT Vision restoration training, 10 sessions, 20 minutes","armGroupLabels":["tDCS"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Standard rehabilitation","description":"Standard rehabilitation procedures involving PC-based training of saccades and visual exploration","armGroupLabels":["Standard rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of mean sensitivity (in dB) detection threshold from baseline to post-intervention","timeFrame":"14-20 days post treatment,"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke\n* Visual Field Defect\n* Lesion age 4 weeks up to 6 month max\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Electrical Implants\n* Metal artefacts in head\n* Epilepsy\n* Visual Neglect","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Raimund Alber, MS","affiliation":"Neurologisches Therapiezentrum Gmundnerberg","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Neurologisches Therapiezentrum Gmundnerberg","city":"Altmuenster","zip":"4813","country":"Austria"},{"facility":"Inst. f.
