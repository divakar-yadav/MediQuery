Visual deprivation training has been shown to be more effective than open-eye training. The investigators intend to examine the changes in electroencephalography patterns in stroke patients during visually deprived walking tasks.\n\nThe stroke participants will be fitted with a brain cap. The participants will walk with their eyes open for 60 seconds, and then their eyes will be blindfolded as they continue walking for another 60 seconds. Electroencephalography will monitor the signals in real-time during both walks.","detailedDescription":"The electroencephalography data collection will be conducted in the Rehabilitation Department of Geriatric Hospital Affiliated with Nanjing Medical University. Upon commencing the experiment, participants will walk at a comfortable pace with their eyes open for a duration of 60 seconds. Following this initial test, a rest period of five minutes will be provided. For the visual deprivation walking trial, participants will be instructed to keep their eyes open throughout the trial. Investigators will apply an adequately sized blindfold to ensure complete visual deprivation, and the participants will proceed to walk for 60 seconds. During both trials, one investigator will remain one step behind the participant at all times to ensure safety."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Electroencephalography","walking","visual deprivation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients who can walk without assistance in their daily life.","interventionNames":["Other: visual deprivation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"visual deprivation","description":"A group of patients walking with eyes open and walking with visual deprivation.","armGroupLabels":["stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"phase locking value","description":"used to evaluate the phase synchronization relationship between two signals.","timeFrame":"Real-time monitoring of electroencephalography data will occur while participants are walking.
