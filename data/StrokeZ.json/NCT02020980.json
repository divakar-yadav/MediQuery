Thus, this study will help to expand the information that is available regarding the impact of BoNT-A treatment in routine clinical practice conditions.\n\nTreatment goals can vary greatly from one patient to another and there is no unique, single outcome that reflects the treatment benefits in all the cases. Therefore, this study with special focus on the achievement of therapeutic goals, will allow the identification of each patient's specific goals regarding the improvement of the functional outcomes, the quality of life and patient well-being."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lower Limb Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":186,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Post-stroke lower limb spasticity patients","interventionNames":["Biological: Botulinum toxin type A"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Botulinum toxin type A","description":"This is an observational study designed to reflect the clinical practice in real life as closely as possible.\n\nBotulinum Toxin Type A (BoNT-A) injection administered according to the local Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the locally agreed treatment guidelines.","armGroupLabels":["Post-stroke lower limb spasticity patients"],"otherNames":["AbobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Pain relief on Numeric Rating Scale","description":"Pain relief evaluated by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).
