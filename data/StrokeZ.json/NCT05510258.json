In this study total two groups included control and experimental and sample size was 48 and 24 persons randomly allocated in each groups as well. In control group conventional therapy given while in experimental group core-stability exercises with conventional therapy given to the patients. while the duration of therapy was 45 minutes per day for 8 weeks. Informed consent was taken from the recruited subjects. Two scales BBS and TIS used to measure the outcomes.
