This proves the importance of neuro-rehabilitative research. Stroke research is often focused on the acute treatment phase as well as the inpatient rehabilitation. A remaining question is how do stroke patients clinically develop after being discharged from the hospital? How stable are the achieved rehabilitation effects and how much more clinical improvement is seen in the following time period, especially with regard to ICF functionality? In this observational longitudinal study, the current practice of neurorehabilitation will be investigated and the influence of motor skills, cognition, care situation, depression, information and fatigue on functional recovery as well as participation, autonomy and quality of life will be evaluated. Stroke patients will be examined at the end of rehabilitation, after three, six and 12 months. In addition, a group of chronic patients undergoes the same examinations and thereby represents a comparison group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Functional recovery","Neurorehabilitation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":227,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Compound score","description":"Compound outcome-parameter for functional recovery (from upper limb motor scores, e.g. Fugl-Meyer assessment, grip force, nine-hole peg test).","timeFrame":"12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Aphasia test","description":"Standardized test for differential diagnosis Aphasia - no aphasia.","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Apraxia screen of TULIA (AST)","description":"The Apraxia Screen from TULIA is a short assessment to diagnose apraxia with 12 hand movements, dichotomous scale: 0 = not fulfilled, 1 = fulfilled motion task.","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Autonomy and participation","description":"Autonomy and participation is measured via different tools, for example with the Index for the Assessment of Health Impairments (IMET) or the subscale Participation/Role function extracted from the Stroke Impact Scale.","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Fatigue scale for motor function and cognition (FSMC)","description":"Fatigue scale for motor and cognitive functions, an assessment of fatigue, containing two subscales (mental and physical fatigue), ranging from 20 (no fatigue at all) to 100 (severest grade of fatigue).","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer assessment upper extremity (FMA)","description":"The section motor function of upper limb is one of five domains, a three-point scale is used for rating performance as 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully, max. possible score: 66 points.","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Grip and pinch force","description":"A dynamometer is used to measure grip strength and a pinch gauge to measure pinch force.","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Index for measuring restrictions on participation (IMET)","description":"The Index of measurement of participation restrictions (IMET) records patient-related participation as a self-evaluation tool, on a scale from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (no more activity possible).","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Knowledge and information needs","description":"A questionnaire developed by the research group (including questions on informativeness and information needs on the topic of stroke).","timeFrame":"3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Line bisection test (LBS)","description":"The line bisection test (LBS) is a test to detect the presence of unilateral spatial neglect.
