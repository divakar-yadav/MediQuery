Its beneficial effect is assumed to be due its neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular calcium and thereby cellular apoptosis, but higher concentrations might induce marked systemic hypotension, thereby inducing cerebral ischemia. Since several dosing regimes and routes of administration with inconclusive superiority exist and since the target site concentration of nimodipine - the unbound drug concentrations beyond the blood-brain barrier - is still not known, it is reasonable to measure nimodipine concentrations within the blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial brain tissue following oral, intra-venous and intra-arterial administration and correlate intra-arterial nimodipine administration to measures of cerebral metabolism and oxygenation.\n\nTherefore, the investigators propose to investigate in 30 patients suffering severe aneurysmal SAH and requiring cerebral microdialysis for cerebral neurochemical monitoring:\n\n* the ability of nimodipine to penetrate into the brain of neurointensive care patients by comparing exposure in brain, CSF and plasma, dependent on the route of administration (i.e. oral, intra-venous, and intra-arterial) and dosing intra-venously (0.5 - 2mg/h)\n* the impact of orally, intra-venously, and intra-arterially delivered nimodipine on cerebral metabolism, i.e. lactate/pyruvate ratio, pbtO2 and transcranial doppler flow velocities\n* the effect of oral and intra-venous nimodipine on systemic hemodynamic and cardiac parameters, using continuous Pulse Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO) monitoring\n* the penetration properties of ethanol - as an excipient of nimodipine infusion - into the brain by comparing exposure in brain, CSF and plasma and quantifying the neuronal exposure to alcohol dependent on blood levels"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Aneurysmal","Delayed Cerebral Ischemia","Vasospasm, Cerebral"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialysate"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"oral nimodipine","description":"60mg of nimodipine is orally administered every 4 h,","interventionNames":["Drug: Nimodipine"]},{"label":"intra-venous nimodipine","description":"nimodipine is continuously administered intra-venously, starting with 0.5 mg/h on day 1 and increased every day for 0.5 mg/h to a maximum dose of 2.0mg/h on day 4","interventionNames":["Drug: Nimodipine"]},{"label":"intra-arterial nimodipine","description":"during endovascular procedure 2mg of nimodipine is infused via a microcatheter into the internal carotid artery for 20 minutes","interventionNames":["Drug: Nimodipine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nimodipine","description":"If application of nimodipine is clinically indicated patients will be enrolled in the study protocol according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
