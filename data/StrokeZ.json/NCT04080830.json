The aim of this study was to understand the stroke mechanism, the regularity of stroke recurrence and its influencing factors, to establish a risk stratification model for stroke recurrence, and to preliminarily explore the relationship between stroke mechanism, risk stratification and antithrombotic regimen in this population.","detailedDescription":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at particularly high risk of recurrent IS and other major vascular events. Current antithrombotic therapy guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation (OAC) alone for the secondary prevention of IS in this high-risk population. However, these guidelines are largely based on evidence from randomized-controlled trials that did not include patients with acute IS. With the exception of the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (EAFT), all randomized-controlled trials evaluating antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF included primary prevention populations. Moreover, the EAFT trial does not inform the management of patients with severe stroke, as these patients were excluded from this trial, and it did not evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination OAC and antiplatelet therapy.Current observational studies also provide very limited information about the optimal antithrombotic regimen for different stroke mechanisms in acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack(TIA) with atrial fibrillation. In fact , the regularity of recurrence, the specific mechanism of ischemic stroke and the optimal antithrombotic regimen for different stroke mechanisms in these patients are still not clear, which limited clinical treatment level of these patients. Patient Registration Study of Acute Ischemic Stroke/transient ischemic attack(TIA) With Atrial Fibrillation (AISWAF) is a single-center prospective, consecutively, observational study, was conducted in patients with acute ischemic stroke/TIA with atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to understand the stroke mechanism, the regularity of stroke recurrence and its influencing factors, to establish a risk stratification model for stroke recurrence, and to preliminarily explore the relationship between stroke mechanism, risk stratification and antithrombotic regimen in this population.The clinical, imaging and laboratory information were collected at baseline. During the 1-year follow-up period, three months, six months and one year after admission, the patients were followed up by telephone or face-to-face to record the status of antithrombotic therapy, compliance, functional status, recurrence of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, major extracranial hemorrhage as well as other vascular events and deaths."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Registration Study","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) with AF","description":"patients with Acute ischemic stroke/TIA and Atrial fibrillation (observational -no intervention)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The rate of recurrent Ischemic stroke/TIA and symptomatic systemic embolism","description":"recurrent ischemic stroke/TIA and symptomatic systemic embolism","timeFrame":"one year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The rate recurrent Ischemic stroke/TIA","description":"Recurrent ischemic stroke/TIA is defined as a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset lasting at least 24 h (or\\<24 h if following therapeutic intervention, i.e. thrombolysis or thrombectomy, or if the deficit results in death\\< 24 h), occurring\\>24 h after the index ischemic stroke, irrespective of vascular territory and that is not attributable to oedema, brain shift, haemorrhagic transformation, intercurrent illness, hypoxia or drug toxicity;","timeFrame":"one year"},{"measure":"The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage(ICH) is defined as a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset lasting at least 24 h with documented ICH on imaging (CT orMRI).
