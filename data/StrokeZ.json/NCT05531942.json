Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive a Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection 25mg/5ml,once/day from Day 1 to Day 14(the injection was diluted with 250ml physiological saline,intravenous drip for about 3 hours), combined with Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) at a dose of 100 mg/d for 90 days;2) the other group will receive the same volume saline injection as placebo for 14 days plus aspirin at a dose of 100 mg per day for 90 days.The primary objective is to assess the anti-platelet effects of Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection combined with Aspirin versus Aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The study consists of 3 visits including the day of randomization, Day 14±2days and Day 90±7days. The trial is anticipated to complete in 10 months from the first subject recruitment , with 70 subjects recruited. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by Ethics Committee of Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ginkgo and aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection 25mg/5ml,once/day from Day 1 to Day 14.
