Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) may be proposed up to 6 hours and from 6 to 24 hours after stroke onset if multimodal imaging demonstrates the presence of a substantial ischemic penumbra.\n\nDespite the major benefit associated with MT, more than half of patients will remain disabled at 3 months. The rate of complete reperfusion after MT appears to be a major factor affecting functional outcome. However, this rate of complete reperfusion is only achieved in 50 % of the patients due to, at least in part, distal microcirculatory impairment and or erratic emboli.\n\nIn coronary artery disease, new antiplatelet agents, with a very short half-life, such as P2Y12 inhibitors (P2Y12I), have been shown to reduce in-stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death. The IV route for P2Y12 inhibitors administration is adapted to the stroke population who has frequently dysphagia that prevents per os drug administration. In addition, the very short half-life of the drug is quite interesting for the management of hemorrhagic complications or emergent surgical interventions and early antithrombotic secondary prevention initiation.\n\nHypothesis: subgroup of patients treated from 0 to 24 hours after onset with a demonstrated ischemic penumbra on perfusion imaging, the administration of P2Y12I in addition to MT and best medical management (BMM) may increase reperfusion rates and improve functional outcome compared to MT with BMM alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"experimental group will be treated by P2Y12 inhibitor (cangrelor) in addition to MT and BMM","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":368,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cangrelor group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"treated by P2Y12 inhibitor (cangrelor) in addition to MT and BMM.
