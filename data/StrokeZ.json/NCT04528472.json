Through the cohort study method, 194 patients with acute ischemic stroke were evaluated for neurological impairment, motor dysfunction, TCM Symptoms and Symptoms Scale, combined with the patients' head MRI. , Plasma BDNF, MMP-9 and other biomarkers, screen TCM syndromes related to stroke outcome indicators, and adopt targeted comprehensive acupuncture and moxibustion program intervention and follow-up to establish a stroke-specific intervention outcome prediction model with TCM characteristics.
