High-intensity signal in the plaque on the TOF-MRA is associated to a high risk of cerebral embolism during stenting. The evidence of protection selection in such patients was limited. A single center, prospective, outcome- assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial study (CASH-ES) is designed to compare the efficiency of two distal embolism protection devices (SpiderFX and Emboshield NAV6) during CAS procedure of patients with vulnerable plaque. Asymptomatic patients with internal carotid artery stenosis ≥ 70% (NASCET) and symptomatic patients with a stenosis ≥ 50% who is over 70 years old, diagnostic of vulnerable plaque on ultrasound or have a high-intensity signal in the relevant plaques on TOF-MRA will be included. Patients are randomized in two balanced groups (1:1) to receive CAS with either distal (Spider FX) or distal (Emboshield NAV6) protection. The primary endpoint is the incidence of new cerebral ipsilateral ischemic lesions on the DW-MRI within 7-days post operation. Secondary endpoints include the number, size, location of new cerebral ischemic lesions on the DW-MRI, the counts of MES during TCCD monitoring during procedure, procedural complications, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death within 7 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Carotid Stenosis","Carotid Artery Stent"],"keywords":["stroke","carotid stenosis","carotid artery stenting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":172,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Emboshield NAV6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"using Emboshield NAV6 distal embolism protection device during CAS","interventionNames":["Device: Emboshield"]},{"label":"SpiderFX","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"using SpiderFX distal protection device during CAS","interventionNames":["Device: Spider"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Emboshield","description":"a distall occlusion Emboshield NAV6 will be used as the embolism protection device during CAS","armGroupLabels":["Emboshield NAV6"],"otherNames":["Emboshield NAV6 (Abbott vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Spider","description":"a distal SpiderFX will be used as the embolism protection device during CAS","armGroupLabels":["SpiderFX"],"otherNames":["SpiderFX (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ipsilateral new ischemic lesions on DWI","description":"The incidence of ipsilateral new ischemic lesions on DWI after CAS","timeFrame":"Within 7 days post-operation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"major stroke","description":"the incidence of major stroke after CAS, defined as new onset of neurological symptoms causing an increase of NIHSS ≥ 4 or worsening of existing focal neurological deficit lasting ≥ 24 hours","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"myocardial infarction","description":"the incidence of myocardial infarction after CAS, defined as new onset of chest discomfort or cardiac stroke or heart failure with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers and ECG abnormalities","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"death","description":"In-hospital mortality","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"Any hemorrhage, acute kidney injury and other procedure-related complications","description":"including major/minor hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, etc.","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"The number of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","description":"The number of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"The size of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","description":"The size of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"The location of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","description":"The location of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"MES counting during CAS","description":"TCD monitoring of MES counting during CAS","timeFrame":"during CAS procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
