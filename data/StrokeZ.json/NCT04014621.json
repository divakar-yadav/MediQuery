Randomization will be dynamic according to the patient's baseline covariates of core volume, total volume, Hypoperfusion Intensity Ratio (HIR), time to baseline imaging, age, NIHSS. Patients in the Treated arm will be treated with active SPG stimulation while patients in the Control arm will undergo sham treatment. After treatment/sham treatment, patients in both groups will undergo a follow up brain non-contrast CT, CT perfusion and CT angiography imaging, 6:45hrs±15min after baseline CTP initiation.\n\nIn the case the patient is cooperative, hand strength (pinch and grasp) evaluations should be assessed before and during the 1st treatment/ sham SPG stimulation session.\n\nFollowing the assessment of the penumbra (after 6 hours) patients will be treated or sham treated for 5 additional consecutive sessions (4 hours each), the first starting within 18-24 hours from stroke onset and the others 18-26 hours from previous treatment initiation and will be followed for 90 days to assess their clinical outcome. In one session (preferably at day 2) Common Carotid Doppler examination is performed to evaluate blood flow dynamics before and during the treatment/sham session.\n\nAfter the last treatment session, the implant is removed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","randomized clinical trial","anterior circulation","penumbra"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treated","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Treated arm patients will be implanted and treated with one session of SPG stimulation for 6 hours and 5 additional consecutive sessions (4 hours each) of SPG stimulation, the first starting within 18-24 hours from stroke onset and the others 18-26 hours from previous treatment initiation.","interventionNames":["Device: SPG stimulation"]},{"label":"Control","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Control arm patients will be implanted and receive 6 hours of sham stimulation and 5 additional consecutive sessions (4 hours each) of sham stimulation, the first starting within 18-24 hours from stroke onset and the others 18-26 hours from previous treatment initiation.","interventionNames":["Device: SPG stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SPG stimulation","description":"The BrainsGate Ischemic Stroke System (ISS) consists of an implantable neurostimulator designed to deliver electrical stimulation to the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) and/or nerves within the greater palatine canal and pterygopalatine fossa.","armGroupLabels":["Control","Treated"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Volume of core expansion","description":"The primary outcome measure is the volume of core expansion (in milliliters) in 6:45h±15 min.
