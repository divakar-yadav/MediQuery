Patients patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left and orientate instead to their right side. Enduring neglect has been found to be a poor prognostic indicator for functional independence following stroke. Despite some promising experimental accounts there are no established treatments for this condition.\n\nThe aim of this study is to test whether a combined treatment with hemifield eye patching (HEP) and optokinetic stimulation (OKS) can permanently reduce neglect behaviour and improve functional outcome in patients with hemispatial neglect following stroke.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that the treatment with HEP and OKS will lead to a greater reduction of neglect scoring in the neglect test battery as well as a greater improvement in functional independence scores as compared to the spontaneous clinical course of the usual-care control group.","detailedDescription":"To specify, this study should answer the following main question: Does the daily wearing of hemifield eye patches over a period of 1 week in combination with daily sessions of optokinetic stimulation lead to a significant reduction of neglect behaviour as measured by total scores in a paper-and-pencil neglect test battery and/or an improvement in functional independence scores (Catherine-Bergego-Scale, Barthel Index) in a cohort of stroke patients with acute hemispatial neglect as compared to the spontaneous course of the disease in a control patient group without a neglect-specific treatment?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spatial Neglect","Cerebral Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients in this control group will receive usual care following stroke including standard physiotherapy and occupational therapy."},{"label":"HEP-OKS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: hemifield eye patching (HEP) + optokinetic stimulation (OKS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"hemifield eye patching (HEP) + optokinetic stimulation (OKS)","description":"Patients in this arm will wear standard spectacle frames containing noncorrective lenses to which right half-field patches are attached (hemifield eye patching, HEP).

The glasses will be worn all-day for the duration of the treatment phase (seven days) and only be removed for sleeping and face cleaning as well as for the duration of the daily OKS treatment sessions.\n\nFurthermore these patients will receive daily sessions (20 minutes) of optokinetic stimulation (OKS). Therefore patients will be seated in front of a widescreen monitor, watching a black background with a pattern of various objects (size 1°), which coherently and continuously move to the left at a velocity of 10 °/s.","armGroupLabels":["HEP-OKS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Total score in a neglect test battery","description":"Performance in a neglect test battery (score between 0 and 100%) consisting of standard neglect tests including two cancellation tasks, line bisection, figure copying and text reading","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at Day 8 (post-treatment)"},{"measure":"Functional independence score","description":"Level of functional independence (score between 0 and 100%) as measured by the Barthel-Index and the Catherine-Bergego-Scale","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at Day 8 (post-treatment)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Performance in paper-and-pencil subtests","description":"The secondary outcome measures include scores of the individual subtests of the neglect test battery, i.e. bells and star cancellation tasks, line bisection, figure copying and text reading.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at Day 8 and at Day 30"},{"measure":"Performance in computerized attention tests","description":"Performance in two computerized attention tests.
