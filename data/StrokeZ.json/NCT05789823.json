The investigators have conducted a 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of ischemic post-conditioning incrementally for a longer duration of up to 5 min × 4 cycles in stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The purpose of this study is to further determine the efficacy and safety of ischemic post-conditioning in patients with acute ischemic stroke who are treated with mechanical thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":168,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic post-conditioning group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy combined with ischemic post-conditioning","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical thrombectomy combined with ischemic post-conditioning"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy alone","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical thrombectomy alone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mechanical thrombectomy combined with ischemic post-conditioning","description":"Ischemic post-conditioning will be applied after successful recanalization of the culprit artery achieve by thrombectomy.
