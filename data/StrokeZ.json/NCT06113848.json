However, many studies have shown that, even with successful recanalization, about half of patients do not achieve functional independence. This phenomenon is called futile recanalization, which is partly attributed to brain no-reflow (microcirculation reperfusion failure despite recanalization of the occluded large artery). The mechanisms of brain no-reflow phenomenon include inflammation, micro thrombosis, aggregation platelets and red blood cells, and pericyte contraction.\n\nAlbumin, the most copious plasma protein synthesized primarily in the liver, possesses various biochemical properties, including anti-inflammatory, inhibiting platelet aggregation and micro thrombosis formation, and increasing microvascular perfusion. All of these properties are directed toward the mechanisms of no-reflow production, so albumin may inhibit no-reflow to improve the prognosis of stroke patients. TNK is a new generation thrombolytic agent that inhibits thrombosis, improves microcirculatory perfusion, and may inhibit no-reflow. These functions of TNK are similar to those of albumin, and the two also can reduce infraction volume and cerebral edema, and improve of behavioral function. In this study, we plan to determine the feasibility and efficacy of intra-arterial TNK and albumin for stroke patients undergoing successful mechanical thrombectomy and whether there is a synergistic effect between TNK and albumin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Albumin","TNK","No-reflow","Endovascular Therapy","Large Vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intra-Arterial TNK and Albumin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Intra-Arterial TNK and Albumin"]},{"label":"Intra-Arterial TNK","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Intra-Arterial TNK"]},{"label":"Intra-Arterial Albumin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Intra-Arterial Albumin"]},{"label":"sham","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: sham"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intra-Arterial TNK and Albumin","description":"The study population was divided into four groups, one of which had intra-arterial TNK and albumin.","armGroupLabels":["Intra-Arterial TNK and Albumin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intra-Arterial TNK","description":"The study population was divided into four groups, one of which had intra-arterial TNK .","armGroupLabels":["Intra-Arterial TNK"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intra-Arterial Albumin","description":"The study population was divided into four groups, one of which had intra-arterial albumin.","armGroupLabels":["Intra-Arterial Albumin"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"sham","description":"The study population was divided into four groups, one of which had no intra-arterial TNK and albumin.","armGroupLabels":["sham"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with major response","description":"Major response is any of the following:\n\n1.
