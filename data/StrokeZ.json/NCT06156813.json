Subsequently, the Lower Extremity Motor Activity Diary was developed. This survey is a semi-structured survey in which the participant is asked to rate himself/herself according to each scale over 14 activities.","detailedDescription":"The Motor Activity Log was developed to measure paretic upper extremity use in daily activities in the real-life context (real world) of people with different health conditions, including stroke. Real-world use outside the individual's clinical/laboratory environment, including daily activities (e.g., walking indoors and outdoors above ground, climbing stairs, getting in and out of a car, jumping over an object, picking up an object, sitting and standing) It's about what they do.\n\nThe Motor Activity Log is a reliable patient self-report measure and correlates significantly with another real-world measure, the accelerometer.\n\nAdaptation of the Motor Activity Log to the lower extremity involved the development of three subscales to measure changes in types of activity that are bilateral in nature and use of the paretic lower extremity: level of assistance, functional ability, and confidence. The Lower Extremity Motor Activity Log is a semi-structured questionnaire in which the participant is asked to rate himself on each scale across 14 activities. The score for each scale is the average of the rate provided for each activity. Additionally, a composite score can be calculated that combines all scales through assistance, functional ability, and confidence scores.\n\nA preliminary study with individuals with stroke using the English version of the Lower Extremity Motor Activity Log-14 showed that the total score was 0.93, 0.90, 0.94, and 0.88 test-retest for the composite score, assistance, functional ability, and confidence scales, respectively. The test showed that it has reliability.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Lower Extremity Motor Activity Log-14."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spastic Paraplegia"],"keywords":["LE-MAL","Spasticity","Measurement","validity","reliability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Diagnostic test","description":"Measurements for validity and reliability"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tr- LE-MAL","description":"t is a semi-structured interview that includes questions to determine the participant's level of assistance, movement quality and confidence while performing a 14-day activity.","timeFrame":"baseline and two weeks later"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","description":"This scale, which aims to evaluate the perception of the quality of life after stroke by the patients themselves or their caregivers, consists of 8 subsections and 59 questions.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"6 min walk test","description":"Functional capacity in terms of mobility is evaluated by measuring the person's maximum walking distance within a six-minute period.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals between the ages of 18-80 living in Gaziantep who applied to the neurology outpatient clinic of Hospital and were diagnosed with stroke.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a history of trauma within the last year, alcohol and substance addiction, and pregnancy","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Zekiye İpek Katırcı Kırmacı, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+90 544 261 82 85","email":"ipekkatirci@hotmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Zekiye İpek Katırcı Kırmacı","affiliation":"Gaziantep Islam Science and Technology University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Gaziantep Islam Science and Technology University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Gaziantep","country":"Turkey","contacts":[{"name":"Zekiye İpek Katırcı kırmacı","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.05944,"lon":37.3825}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010264","term":"Paraplegia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000010243","term":"Paralysis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12867","name":"Paraplegia","asFound":"Paraplegia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12847","name":"Paralysis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4421","name":"Paraplegia","asFound":"Paraplegia","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
