Circulating progenitor cells will be enumerated and the distribution patterns of these cell types will be assessed to determine if these parameters differ between individuals of South Asian origin and European origin. Specifically, this study will evaluate if differential regenerative cell exhaustion (RCE) may account, at least in part, for the differences in cardiovascular risk reported between individuals of South Asian vs European origin.","detailedDescription":"Individuals of South Asian origins have been reported to be at higher risk of ischemic heart disease than those of European origins. While differential morphometries and culturally related behavioural habits are believed to account in part for the difference, there is growing evidence that cardiometabolic risk factors can accelerate pro-vascular progenitor cell depletion and dysfunction. The cumulative effects that aberrant regenerative cell exhaustion (RCE) have on vessel repair accordingly increases the risk of atherothrombotic events.\n\nORIGINS-RCE is an observational, cross-sectional, two-arm study that will evaluate the progenitor cell profiles of peripheral blood samples from 120 individuals (60 of South Asian origins, 60 of European origins). The working hypothesis is that individuals of South Asian and European origins have innately different progenitor profiles that can be further altered by behavioural/cultural habits. The resultant differences in RCE capability will affect the balance between pro-inflammatory and vessel repair functions that in turn contribute to the contrasting cardiometabolic risks exhibited between the two study cohorts."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Type 1 Diabetes","Type 2 Diabetes","Ischemic Heart Disease","Ischemic Stroke","Cardiovascular Diseases","Peripheral Vascular Diseases"],"keywords":["Progenitor Cells","Cardiometabolic Risk","Ethnic Origins"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"South Asian Origin","description":"Individuals who identify as having Anglo-Indian, Bangladeshi, Bengali, Bhutanese, Goan, Gujarati, Indian, Jatt, Kashmiri, Maharashtrian, Malayali, Nepali, Pakistani, Punjabi, Sindhi, Sinhalese, Sri Lankan, Tamil, Telugu, or other South Asian origin"},{"label":"White Individuals of European Origin","description":"Individuals who identify as having western European, other northern European, southern European, eastern European or other European origin"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The change in the frequency / absolute number of circulating ALDHhiSSChi granulocyte precursor cells between individuals of South Asian origins and White individuals of European origin","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The change in the frequency / absolute number of circulating ALDHhiSSCmid precursor cells with monocytes/macrophage phenotype between individuals of South Asian origins and White individuals of European origin","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"The change in the frequency / absolute number of circulating ALDHhiSSClo cells with primitive provascular progenitor cell phenotype between individuals of South Asian origins and White individuals of European origin","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in the concentration of serum oxidative stress markers individuals of South Asian origins and White individuals of European origins","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Changes in the concentration of serum inflammatory markers individuals of South Asian origins and White individuals of European origins","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"1.
