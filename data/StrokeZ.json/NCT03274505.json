Consequences of theses sleep disturbances include impaired functional outcome and quality of life, anxious and depressive troubles and increased cardio-vascular morbi-mortality. Mechanisms underlying sleep disorders in the setting of stroke are complex and still partly elucidated. They probably involve the consequences of the ischemic lesion and of the handicap, but also of associated vascular risk factors and more generally pre-existent medical history, or they could represent themselves a risk factor for stroke. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a particular condition in which risk factors and background of patients are similar to that observed in stroke, without any cerebral lesion and no persistent neurological deficit. The main objective of the SOMN'AIC study is to compare the prevalence of sleep disorders in stroke and in transient ischemic attack (TIA). The study hypothesis is that the prevalence of sleep disorders may be higher in stroke than in TIA patients, reflecting the consequences of the lesion and the associated handicap."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Disorder","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Patients seen by a rehabilitation physician at a routine 3 months' post-stroke examination","interventionNames":["Other: Questionnaires"]},{"label":"TIA patients","description":"Patients seen by a stroke specialist at the \"SOS TIA\" examination","interventionNames":["Other: Questionnaires"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaires","description":"* Questionnaires about excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale), insomnia (Severity of Insomnia Scale), Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronotype (Horne and Ostberg questionnaire), Sleep apnoea syndrome (Berlin questionnaire)\n* Clinical evaluation\n* Routine neuropsychological evaluation (for stroke patients)\n* Routine Polysomnography for patients with high suspicion of sleep apnoea syndrome (SOS score (Epworth + Berlin) \\> 10)","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients","TIA patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of stroke and transient ischemic attack population regarding the prevalence of the presence of at least one sleep disorder","description":"Presence of at least one of the following sleep disorders assessed by clinical evaluation, questionnaires +/- polysomnography: insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), restless legs syndrome (RLS) and sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS)","timeFrame":"Maximum 9 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke group: patients with a diagnosis of stoke and seen at the routine post-stroke 3 month' rehabilitation examination\n* TIA group: diagnosis of a TIA by a stroke specialist at the \"SOS TIA\" examination\n* \\> 18 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Refusal to participate\n* Severe cognitive impairment leading to inability to fulfil questionnaires\n* For the TIA group: presence of an ischemic lesion on CT scan or MRI","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke and transient ischemic attack patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Laure PETER-DEREX, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"04 72 07 17 69","phoneExt":"+33","email":"laure.peter-derex@chu-lyon.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service de Neurologie Vasculaire Groupement Hospitalier Est","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Bron","zip":"69477","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Laurent Derex, PH","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Elodie Ong, PH","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.73333,"lon":4.91667}},{"facility":"Sleep Medicine Center, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon","status":"ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING","city":"Lyon","zip":"69004","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.74848,"lon":4.84669}},{"facility":"Service de MPR- Hôpital Henry Gabrielle -
