Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalogram (TMS-EEG) recording can be used to investigate both intracortical excitatory and inhibitory circuits of the primary motor cortex (M1) and the property of brain networks.\n\nThis study is to investigate the immediate effects of iTBS on intracortical excitatory and inhibitory circuits, neural connectivity, and network properties in patients with chronic stroke, using TMS-EEG and TMS-EMG approaches.\n\nIn this randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study, 21 patients with chronic stroke receive two separate stimulation conditions: a single-session iTBS or sham stimulation applied to the ipsilesional M1, in two separate visits, with a washout period of five to seven days between the two visits after crossover. A battery of TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG measurements are taken before and immediately after stimulation during the visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","theta burst stimulation","transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials","intracortical inhibition","cortical excitability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A single-session intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The classical 600-pulse iTBS protocol is delivered to the motor hotspot over the ipsilesional hemisphere.","interventionNames":["Device: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)"]},{"label":"A single-session sham intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham stimulation is the same as that of iTBS, but the coil is placed five centimeters away from the scalp.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)","description":"A single-session standard 600-pulse intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is applied to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex.","armGroupLabels":["A single-session intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)","description":"The sham stimulation is the same as that of iTBS, but the coil is placed five centimeters away from the scalp.
