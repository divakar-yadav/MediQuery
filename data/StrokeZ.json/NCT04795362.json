The early diagnosis of the occurrence of an DCI is therefore a major challenge in order to optimise management before irreversible lesions are formed. However, the means of diagnosis are often not available, and up to a third of DCI are discovered on follow-up images when the lesions are already present. Among the markers of brain injury, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) is an astrocyte protein released into the bloodstream at the time of the appearance of a brain lesion. Its short half-life makes it a prime candidate for patient follow-up to diagnose a new ischemic lesion and assess the effectiveness of its management.\n\nAmong the elements at the origin of DCI, the occurrence of proximal vasospasm is the main element on which we can have a therapeutic action. The strategy implemented in the department consists of performing a mechanical angioplasty when proximal vasospasm is detected with a decrease in downstream cerebral perfusion. Nevertheless the benefit of this therapeutic action is discussed and there is currently no early marker of the effectiveness of this procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["subarachnoid haemorrhage","S100B","Delayed cerebral ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients with Delayed cerebral ischemia","description":"50 adult patients hospitalized in neurological intensive care unit for subarachnoid hemorrhage, in whom the onset of delayed cerebral ischemia is suspected will be included.","interventionNames":["Biological: blood sample"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"blood sample","description":"5 tubes of 1 milliliters (ml) will be sampled on a catheter placed as part of the usual practice every hour for 4 hours (at Time 0, at Time 1 hour, at time 2hours, at Time 3 hours, at time 4 hours) as soon as DCI is suspected.\n\nIn the event of a mechanical angioplasty decision, the samples will be continued (Time 0, Time 2 hours, Time 4 hours, Time 6hours, Time 12 hours, Time 24 hours, so 6 samples of 1 ml).","armGroupLabels":["patients with Delayed cerebral ischemia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"S100B serum concentration after DCI suspicion.","description":"S100B repeated samples, measure with an ELISA kit from ROCHE diagnostic.\n\nMeasurement of the evolution of the S100B during at T0, T1h, T2h, T3h, T4h after the suspicion of DCI by the physician in charge.\n\nIf an intravascular angioplasty procedure is performed S100B kinetic will be measured at T0, T2h, T4h, T6h, T12h and T24h after the procedure.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 2 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults\n* Patient hospitalised in the neurological intensive care unit for a subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n* Delayed cerebral ischaemia suspected during routine care.\n* Presence of a catheter (arterial or venous) for repeated sampling.\n* Patient having been informed and having formulated his non-opposition or close to the patient having been informed and having formulated his non-opposition.
