However, it is still unclear if patients with minor strokes and LVO also benefit from MT.The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MT for acute LVO and mild symptoms.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective cohort study of patients with with mild ischemic stroke (NIHSS Score \\<6) and LVO. Patients were divided into 2 groups: MT or medical management.Baseline data and clinical outcomes were compared. A independent clinical outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 90 days. A excellent clinical outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage(sICH) was the safety outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","acute large vessel occlusion","thrombectomy","mild stroke;","prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A prospective, non-randomized, controlled, outcome-blinded study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients in this group will receive mechanical thrombectomy and standardized drug treatment of acute ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"patients in this group will receive standardized drug treatment of acute ischemic stroke"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mechanical Thrombectomy","description":"Solitaire stent and manual aspiration thrombectomy were performed as the first-line endovascular treatment","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale(mRS) score of 0 to 2","description":"independent outcome at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale(mRS) score of 0 to 1","description":"excellent outcome at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage transformation","description":"Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) transformation was defined according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS)-III criteria","timeFrame":"36 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset presenting cortical symptoms (such as aphasia, somnolence,slow-minded,etc.) or vertigo with bilateral pathological signs;\n2. age≥18 years old;\n3. the NIHSS score before evaluation of thrombectomy\\<6;\n4. large artery occlusion including Middle cerebral artery M1, proximal M2 segment, intracranial internal carotid artery and infarct core volume≤50ml and mismatch ratio\\>1.8 or basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery P1 occlusion\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
