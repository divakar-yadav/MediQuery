The double-blinded study will be randomized, placebo controlled at up to approximately 100 sites.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 adaptive, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DM199 for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Participants with AIS will be randomized 1:1 to DM199 or placebo (placebo is normal saline given with the same route (IV or SC), volume and frequency as DM199), administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose followed by a subcutaneous (SC) dose within 2-12 hours of IV dose completion and then 2 times per week for three weeks (until Day 21). After dosing is complete, participants will be followed up by the investigator at approximately 30 and 90 days after their first dose.\n\nA formal interim analysis will be conducted after 144 participants complete their Day 90 assessment in Part A. The purposes of this interim analysis are to assess safety, allow early stopping of the study for futility, or continuing the study with a revised final sample size of between 240 up to 728. The futility rule will be non-binding."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Stroke"],"keywords":["acute","ischemic","stroke","AIS","tPA","LVO","MT","KLK1","Kallikreins"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Phase 2/3 Adaptive Design, Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of DM199 for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke (ReMEDy2 Trial)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"To minimize bias, the participant and PI will be blinded to treatment assignment.
