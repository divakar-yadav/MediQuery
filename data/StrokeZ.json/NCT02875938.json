The two music conditions include 1) music with sung lyrics simultaneously with silent reading of the written lyrics; and 2) music with sung lyrics, followed by silent reading of the written lyrics (i.e. priming with the music). A control set without music will be used additionally within every third session to detect potential history and maturation effects. All conditions will be followed by a silent reading phrase-completion task composed of written words from the total combined sets of stimuli.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this investigation is to examine the evidence on emotion, language, and music, and propose a first step, in the form of a single-subject research design, to determine the most effective and efficient method for application to the rehabilitation of patients with aphasia. A single-subject adapted alternating treatment design will be used to compare two music conditions, using music with sung lyrics simultaneously with silent reading of the lyrics, and priming with music and sung lyrics followed by reading of the lyrics, with a control condition using reading materials without music. Risks are expected to be minimal. The risk is confidentiality. Risk management procedures in this study include: assuring confidentiality of participants, assuring qualified personnel, assuring convenient location, ensuring adequate enrollment, continual monitoring, addressing potential conflicts of interest, and making a plan to manage problems. Continual monitoring will be used to assess whether study interventions appear to be interfering with normal speech therapy treatment. If the researcher sees any signs of interference, the subject will be withdrawn from the research and study interventions will be stopped."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"],"keywords":["left middle cerebral artery","cerebrovascular accident (CVA)","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Music and reading lyrics","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A single-subject adapted alternating treatment design will be used to compare two music conditions, using music with sung lyrics simultaneously with silent reading of the lyrics, and priming with music and sung lyrics followed by reading of the lyrics, with a control condition using reading materials without music.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Simultaneous music and reading lyrics","Behavioral: Priming with music","Behavioral: Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Simultaneous music and reading lyrics","description":"music with sung lyrics simultaneously with silent reading of the lyrics.","armGroupLabels":["Music and reading lyrics"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Priming with music","description":"priming with music and sung lyrics followed by reading of the lyrics.","armGroupLabels":["Music and reading lyrics"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Control","description":"control condition using reading materials without music.","armGroupLabels":["Music and reading lyrics"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percent correct responses per day on phrase completion task.","description":"Differential response to the interventions (counted as the percent correct responses per day.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 1 year"},{"measure":"Number of sessions required to achieve mastery.","description":"count number of sessions.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 1 year"},{"measure":"Retention of the reading material","description":"Number of items recalled.","timeFrame":"3 weeks post-intervention."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) Body Functions/Structures, Activities, and Participation","description":"Pretest/post-test information on the ICF Body Functions/Structures, Activities, and Participation (Hurkmans et al. 2011).","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 1 year"},{"measure":"Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination-Third Edition (BDAE-3)","description":"The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination-Third Edition (BDAE-3) (Goodglass, Harold, \\& Barresi, Austin: PRO-Ed.): Pretest reading scores on the BDAE full version subtests, i.e. B.
