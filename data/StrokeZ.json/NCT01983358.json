PARP-1 inhibitor add-on therapy of tPA will be very useful to prevent social, economic loss from physical, and mental disable by stroke.\n\nThis clinical trial progresses to explore safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of JPI-289 by single dose escalation(7cohort). Investigational product medication of each level within 4 weeks evaluate safety and tolerability of patient through Data Safety Monitoring Board(DSMB) which is composed of more than 3 experts except principal investigator until the last visit. In each level 6 patients for investigational product and 2 patients for placebo will be allocated respectively in double blind manner."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["PARP-1 inhibitor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"JPI-289","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each cohort, volunteers will be infused JPI-289 through I.V for 30 min.(6 volunteers per each cohort, total 7 cohort)","interventionNames":["Drug: JPI-289"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Each cohort, volunteer will be infused placebo through I.V for 30 min.(2 volunteers per each cohort, total 7 cohort)","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"JPI-289","description":"PARP-1 inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["JPI-289"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Difference of ECG, vital sign and diagnostic test in JPI-289 group and placebo group","timeFrame":"-21d~9d"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Difference of concentration of JPI-289 in Plasma between JPI-289 group and placebo group","description":"* Blood\n* Urine 0h(pre-dose), 5min, 10min, 20min, 30min(before termination of infusion JPI-289), 45min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h","timeFrame":"0h~48h , 15 points"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Difference of PAR level in PBMC between JPI-289 group and placebo group","description":"-Blood 0h(pre-dose),1h, 4h, 7h, 24h, 48h","timeFrame":"0h(pre-dose)~48h, 6 points"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 19\\~55 years healthy male\n* BMI measurement 20kg/m²\\~27kg/m²\n* 90 ≤ SBP\\<140(mmHg) 60 ≤ DBP\\<100(mmHg) 45 ≤ Pulse rate\\<100(bpm)\n* Signed the informed consent from to participate voluntarily and to comply with the trial requirements\n* For a follow-up visit and during the study period, blood samples and availability\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of clinically significant hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, endocrine, psychiatric, hematooncologic, cardiovascular (Specially asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer)\n* History of skin disease of graft affecting absorption of the drug\n* History of drug abuse\n* Positive urine drug screening\n* Administrated investigational product in a previous clinical trial within 60 days of the screening test\n* Donated blood within 60 days prior to screening test","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"19 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"HyeongSeok Lim, M.D.,Ph.D.","affiliation":"AIDS Malignancy Consortium","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Asan Medical Center","city":"Seoul","state":"Song-Pa Gu","zip":"138-736","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
