Additionally, recent studies have found that RIC was safe and feasible in patients with AIS even in those caused by large artery occlusion and treated with reperfusion therapy, and it might benefit AIS patients by reducing the risk of brain tissue infarction and improving functional outcomes. To date, however, it is still unknow whether RIC, a systematic protective strategy, could benefit patients with AIS complicating ACS.This study aimed to investigate whether RIC is safe and effective in patients with AIS complicating ACS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Elderly Patients","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Acute Coronary Syndrome"],"keywords":["remote ischemic conditioning","elderly","acute ischemic stroke","Acute Coronary Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The RIC and sham procedure were performed by using identical devices with different cuff pressures (200mmHg versus 60 mmHg).
