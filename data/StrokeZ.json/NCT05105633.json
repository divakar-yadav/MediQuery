If the patient gives informed consent they will be randomised 50:50 using a central computerised allocation process to either standard of care (no intravenous thrombolytic treatment or intravenous alteplase 0.9mg/kg) or tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg before undergoing mechanical thrombectomy as required at treating clinician's discretion. The trial is Multi-arm, Multi-stage, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) design with seamless phase 2b/3 transition if the intermediate endpoint (recanalization without symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage) is met in analysis of the first 202 patients. Adaptive sample size re-estimation (Mehta and Pocock) will be performed when 240 patients have completed 3 month follow-up (minimum sample size 320, maximum sample size 688).","detailedDescription":"The study is a Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS), multiregional, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), controlled seamless phase 2b/3 trial (2 arm with 1:1 randomisation) with adaptive sample size recalculation in patients with stroke due to basilar artery occlusion. Stage 1 will use the surrogate outcome of recanalization without symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) to establish whether proceeding to Stage 2 is warranted. If results in the first n= 202 patients meet success criteria, the trial will seamlessly convert to a phase 3 design using modified Rankin scale 0-1 at 3 months as the primary outcome (minimum n=320 with interim sample size re-estimation at n=240, maximum sample n=688) using the Mehta and Pocock conditional power method. Each regionally-based stratum will be pooled in the final analysis and analysed as a stratification by geographic region. Randomisation of patients within each stratum will be stratified by the investigator's intention to treat with mechanical thrombectomy (or not) and the investigator's intention to treat with alteplase intravenous thrombolysis should the patient be randomised to the control group (or not). Covariate adjusted minimum sufficient balance randomisation will then be applied to control for age, NIHSS and time from onset-to-randomisation (dichotomized as 0-6 hours vs 6-24 hours). The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that the thrombolytic tenecteplase (TNK, 0.25mg/kg) ± mechanical thrombectomy administered within 24 hours after symptoms onset, is superior to current best practice (alteplase, rtPA, 0.9mg/kg or standard care/no lysis ± mechanical thrombectomy) in achieving excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1) or return to the premorbid modified Rankin Scale at 90 days in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion. Estimated study duration is 5 years. Patients will participate in the trial for 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","basilar artery occlusion","Stroke","Tenecteplase","Tissue Plasminogen Activator","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases","Fibrin Modulating Agents","Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will receive either intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg, administered as a bolus over 5-10 seconds) or standard of care (alteplase 0.9mg/kg or no lysis) +/- mechanical thrombectomy","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":688,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intravenous tenecteplase (TNK)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg, administered as a bolus over 5-10 seconds).","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Standard Care (which may include intravenous Alteplase)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive standard of care (no intravenous thrombolytic treatment or intravenous alteplase 0.9mg/kg at the standard licensed dose of 0.9 mg/kg up to a maximum of 90mg, 10% as a bolus and the remainder as an infusion over 1 hour).","interventionNames":["Drug: Standard Care (which may include intravenous Alteplase)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Genetically modified tissue plasminogen activator at a dose of 0.25mg/kg given as an intravenous bolus over 5-10 seconds.","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous tenecteplase (TNK)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Standard Care (which may include intravenous Alteplase)","description":"Patients will receive standard care which may include intravenous alteplase at the standard licensed dose of 0.9 mg/kg up to a maximum of 90mg, 10% as a bolus and the remainder as an infusion over 1 hour.","armGroupLabels":["Standard Care (which may include intravenous Alteplase)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days","description":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 (no disability) or return to baseline mRS (if baseline premorbid mRS 2-3) at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale 0-2 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days","description":"Proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale 0-2 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale 0-3 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days","description":"Proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale 0-3 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Ordinal analysis of the mRS at 90 days","description":"Ordinal analysis of the mRS, merging category 5-6, at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Early clinical improvement","description":"Proportion of patients achieving early clinical improvement (reduction in acute - 72 hour NIHSS score of ≥8 or 72 hour NIHSS 0-1).","timeFrame":"72 hours"},{"measure":"Substantial reperfusion on initial digital subtraction angiography run prior to thrombectomy","description":"Proportion of patients with complete occlusion at baseline who achieve eTICI 2b/3 on initial digital subtraction angiography run prior to thrombectomy.","timeFrame":"Initial angiogram (day 0)"},{"measure":"Quality of Life assessment (EQ-5D) - at 90 days and 12 months","description":"Quality of Life assessment (EQ-5D) - at 90 days and 12 months","timeFrame":"90 days and 12 months"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"Proportion of patients with sICH defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 (PH2), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or intraventricular hemorrhage within 36 of treatment, combined with a neurological deterioration of ≥4 points on the NIHSS from baseline, or leading to death.","timeFrame":"36 hours"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality within 90 days","description":"All-cause mortality within 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 5-6 at 90 days","description":"Proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 5-6 at 90 days (severe disability or death)","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intermediate outcome (Stage 1): Partial or complete recanalization of the basilar artery without sICH","description":"Proportion of patients achieving partial or complete recanalization of the basilar artery on initial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) prior to thrombectomy or repeat CT Angiography (if DSA not performed) without symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).
