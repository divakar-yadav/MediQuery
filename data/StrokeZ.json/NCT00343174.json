This results in a still too small number of patients treated with rtPA ( \\< 15% in best clinical care institutions ). Ancrod is a differently acting biological drug which has been used for a long time but not for acute stroke treatment. STAT was the first RCT of medium size to show a significant benefit/risk ration if treatment starts within 3 hours. ESTAT was designed closely related to STAT but with a longer 6 hours window and specifically extended inclusion/exclusion criteria to avoid secondary complications possibly related to a longer time window."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Infarction","Cerebral Ischemia","Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","vascular diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ancrod"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years and above, both sexes\n* Acute ischemic stroke with first symptoms within 6 hours of beginning\n* Treatment after onset of symptoms\n* SSS \\< 40 at baseline ( consciousness necessary )\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical or CT evidence of brain hemorrhage or hemorrhagic transformation\n* CT evidence of major signs of developing infarction\n* Coma\n* Prior strokes within 6 weeks\n* Severe hypertension (\\> 220 systolic \\> 120 mm Hg diastolic)\n* Baseline fibrinogen \\< 100 mg/dL\n* Recent use of thrombolytic agents\n* Recent or anticipated surgery","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"M G Hennerici, MD","affiliation":"Univ Heidelberg Klinikum Mannheim","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Jean M Orgogozo, MD","affiliation":"Univ Bordeaux France","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17126719","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Hennerici MG, Kay R, Bogousslavsky J, Lenzi GL, Verstraete M, Orgogozo JM; ESTAT investigators.
