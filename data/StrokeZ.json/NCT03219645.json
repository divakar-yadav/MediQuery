A total of approximately 40 patients (18 years≤Age≤ 80 years) with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS \\< 12), who can be treated within 72 hours of symptom onset will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive a Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection 25mg/5ml,once/day from Day 1 to Day 14（the injection must be added slowly into 0.9% sodium chloride injection diluted to 250 ml , intravenous drip for about 2 hours）, combined with Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) given in a total dose of 300 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once/day from Day 2 to Day 14. 2) the other group will receive a 300 mg loading dose of Aspirin on the day of randomization, followed by Aspirin 100 mg once/day from Day 2 to Day 14. The primary objective is to assess the anti-platelet effects of Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection combined with Aspirin versus Aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The study consists of 4 visits including the day of randomization, 24 hours after the first anti-platelet agents,Day 14±2days and Day 90±7days. The antiplatelet effects will be analyzed in total subjects. The trial is anticipated to complete in 6 months from the first subject recruitment , with 40 subjects recruited. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by IRB(Institutional Review Board) /EC(Ethics Committee) in Renji hospital，Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ginkgo and aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Ginkgo Diterpene Lactone Meglumine Injection 25mg/5ml,once/day from Day 1 to Day 14.
