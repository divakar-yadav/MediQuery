The effectiveness of the technique will be evaluated in two interventional contexts: patients whose blindness is long-standing and stable, and another in which intervention is as soon as possible after the stroke.","detailedDescription":"The aims of the study are to:\n\n1. To identify the visual capabilities and neural circuits in stroke patients with stable hemianopia (\\>6 months) that recover after regular multisensory (vs. unisensory) training sessions. This involves:\n\n1A. Using clinical ophthalmological tests and visual perceptual tests to evaluate the visual capabilities that are recovered.\n\n1B. Determining whether the size or extent of cortical lesions are predictive of changes induced by the training technique, and tracking changes in the residual visual circuits using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\n1C. Determining if the training-induced changes improve, persist, or degrade over time by re-assessment at a 12-month followup.\n\n2. Evaluate the effectiveness of an earlier (\\<1 month post-stroke) and more intense training intervention strategy using the above approach and comparing the outcomes in these two approaches."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemianopia, Homonymous","Cortical Blindness, Unspecified Side of Brain"],"keywords":["multisensory","visual perception","neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"There are two principal sub-studies: standard intervention and early intervention.
