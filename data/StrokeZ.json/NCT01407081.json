Then the introductory section of the study Handbook (Making the Most of Your Memory) which includes procedural information on the Stroke Help Program will be reviewed with the stroke survivor and study partner. A study Handbook and a large button speaker phone will be provided to the stroke survivor/partner pair to ensure that both members of the participant-caregiver team can listen to the rehabilitation coach without having to be concerned with holding a handset (an action that may be difficult for some stroke survivors).\n\nTelephone contact by the rehabilitation coach will be organized and the 16-week Stroke Help Cognitive Strategy Training Intervention will proceed. In general the topics or strategies to be discussed will be used to achieve one or more of the following rehabilitation strategies: 1) Understanding cognitive deficits that may result from stroke; 2). Reinforcing, strengthening or re-establishing previously learned patterns of behavior; 3) Establishing new patterns of compensatory mechanisms; 4) Enabling persons to adapt to their cognitive disability.\n\nFollowing the 16-week Cognitive Strategy Training Intervention participants will have an on-site visit to provide qualitative and quantitative data related to the feasibility and efficacy of the program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Impairment","Stroke"],"keywords":["cognitive rehabilitation","SMART goals","telehealth"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"telerehabilitation cognitive strategy training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Telerehabilitation Cognitive Strategy Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Telerehabilitation Cognitive Strategy Training","description":"The strategy intervention is a 16-week program during which a trained rehabilitation coach speaks by telephone to the stroke participant and their caregiver twice a week (one approximately 45-minute 'training' call and one approximately 15-minute 'update' call).
