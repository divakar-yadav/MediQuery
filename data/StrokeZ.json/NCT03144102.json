However, our healthcare systems do not have enough resources to cover the current demand let alone its future increase. There is a need to deploy new approaches that advance the current rehabilitation methods and enhance their efficiency.\n\nOne of the latest approaches used for the rehabilitation of a wide range of deficits of the nervous system is based on virtual reality (VR) applications, which combine training scenarios with dedicated interface devices. On the other hand, recent studies have shown the potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to restore motor function in hemiparetic stroke patients. It must be emphasized, however, that so far little work exists on the quantitative assessment of the clinical impact of VR based approaches in combination with tDCS protocols. We hypothesize that the combination of VR-based motor rehabilitation protocols with concurrent anodal tDCS can boost functional recovery, and may achieve superior effects when compared to 3 alternative treatments: 1) VR without tDCS, 2) occupational therapy with tDCS, and 3) occupational therapy without tDCS.\n\nThe findings derived from this study will contribute to establish a novel and superior neurorehabilitation paradigm that can accelerates the recovery of hemiparetic stroke patients. Besides the clinical impact, such achievement could have relevant socioeconomic impact."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Virtual Reality Based Therapy","Anodal tDCS","Occupational Therapy","Sham tDCS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VR-based motor rehabilitation with tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Virtual Reality-based therapy for upper-limbs motor rehabilitation","Device: Anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"Occupational Therapy with tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)","Behavioral: Occupational Therapy for upper-limbs motor rehabilitation"]},{"label":"VR-based motor rehabilitation with sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Virtual Reality-based therapy for upper-limbs motor rehabilitation","Device: Sham transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"Occupational Therapy with sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Occupational Therapy for upper-limbs motor rehabilitation","Device: Sham transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Virtual Reality-based therapy for upper-limbs motor rehabilitation","description":"During each session, the subject will perform 4 VR-based exercises that involve reaching, grasping, and intercepting virtual objects.
