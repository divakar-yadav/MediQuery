Hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, will be randomised into two arms (1:1): an intervention arm and a control arm. Hospitals in the intervention arm will receive a multi-components intervention based on the Behaviour Change Wheel model, whereas hospitals in the control arm will receive no intervention and maintain existing care. The randomisation will be conducted after one-year baseline data collection. The following baseline data will be used for randomisation match: hospital classification, beds in stroke centre, thrombolysis patient number, and percentage of patients receiving thrombolysis within 60 minutes of stroke onset. Hospitals with no stroke centre or with \\<20 cases received thrombolysis per year will be excluded from the study. The primary outcome will be difference between intervention arm and control arm in the percentage of patients receiving thrombolysis within 60 minutes of stroke onset on the follow-up stage (post-intervention)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thrombolytic Therapy","Acute Stroke","Door to Treatment Time","Quality Improvement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1634,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"an intervention arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hospitals in the intervention arm will receive a multi-components intervention based on the Behaviour Change Wheel model","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Behaviour Change Wheel model guided intervention"]},{"label":"a control arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"hospitals in the control arm will receive no intervention and maintain existing care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Behaviour Change Wheel model guided intervention","description":"Interventions are developed on a psychological model, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) .The fundamental of BCW consists of three essential elements: capability, motivation, and opportunity.
