According to data from the World Health Organization, since 2005, the global probability of a person experiencing a stroke has increased by 50 percent. It is expected that 1 in 4 individuals will face the risk of having a stroke in their lifetime. A stroke can result in significant loss of motor functions, communications abilities, weakness, or hemiparesis, leading to a diminished quality of life. Therefore, improving the rehabilitation process is evidently of paramount significance. Virtual reality has emerged as a novel strategy to improve neurological diseases; however, there is an absence of an immersive software designed specifically for stroke patients within a gamified environment. Therefore, the aim of RESET randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of a gamified, fully immersive, and stroke-specific virtual reality software on disability in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Commercial non-immersive virtual reality group (UC+CVR)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The UC+CVR group will use the Nintendo Switch (Nintendo Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) gaming system with the games Sports.

It consists of 10 common activities, with eight of them representing activities related to personal care and 2 related to mobility. These are assessed for independence/dependence and scored via an arbitrary weighting system- the index yields a total score out of 100 - the higher the score, the lower degree of disability.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quality of life (NEWSQOL)","description":"The Newcastle Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Measure assess the specific health-related quality of life measure of 56 items grouped into 11 domains: feelings; ADL/self-care; cognition; mobility; emotion; sleep; interpersonal relationships; communication; pain/sensation; vision; and fatigue. Each item is rated in range 0 to 3, and they are not significant individually. The results of each domain are obtained by the sum of the scores of the items, and higher values indicate greater impact on quality of life.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"},{"measure":"Upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer assessment of Upper Extremity)","description":"The test consists of 33 items that evaluate the movement, coordination and reflex action of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. Each item is scored on a 3-point scale (0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially, 2=performs fully) and the total score ranges from a minimum of 0 (hemiplegia) to a maximum of 66 points.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"},{"measure":"Gross manual dexterity (The Box and Block Test)","description":"The participant is seated at a table, facing a rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments of equal dimension by means of a partition. A total of 150 colored, wooden cubes or blocks (2.5 cm) are placed in one compartment. The participant is instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other for 60 seconds. The score is the number of blocks moved from one compartment to the other during the trial time. The patient's hand must cross over the partition in order for a point to be given, and blocks that drop or bounce out of the second compartment onto the floor are still rewarded with a point. Multiple blocks carried over at the same time, count as a single point. Higher scores on the test indicate better gross manual dexterity.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"},{"measure":"Handgrip strength","description":"Digital dynamometry will be used to assess the muscular strength in kilograms of both the affected and non-affected upper extremities.Participants will execute the test three times with each hand and the best score will be used to calculate the average of the three repetitions. The non-paretic side will be used as a reference for the paretic side.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"},{"measure":"Lower extremity function (Berg Balance Scale)","description":"The Berg Balance Scale is a quantitative assessment of balance in older adults. The scale consists of 14 items requiring subjects to maintain positions or complete movement tasks (common to everyday life) of varying levels of difficulty. Items receive a score of 0-4 based on ability to meet the specific time and distance requirements of the test. 0 represents inability to complete the item and a 4 represents the ability to complete it independently.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"},{"measure":"Lower extremity function (Time Up and Go test)","description":"The Time Up and Go assesses the ability to perform sequential motor tasks relative to walking and turning. The test requires participants to stand up from a chair, walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and seat by themselves in the minimum timeframe possible. The time taken to complete the test is registered.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"},{"measure":"Cognitive function (global cognitive function)","description":"Mini-Mental State Examination consists of 11 simple questions or tasks related to global cognitive function. Typically, these are grouped into 7 cognitive domains; orientation to time, orientation to place, registration of three words, attention and calculation, recall of 3 words, language, and visual construction. The total score ranges 0-30.

Successful performance of this test requires letter and number recognition, mental flexibility, visual scanning, and motor function. The Part B of the test consists of 25 circles, 13 of them numbered 1 to 13 and, and 12 lettered A to L, randomly distributed over a page of paper. The participant is required to connect the circles with a pencil as quickly as possible, alternating between numbers and letters and taking both series in ascending sequence (i.e. 1, A, 2, B, 3, C...). The time taken to complete the task and the number of errors are recorded in seconds. Greater time indicates greater impairment. A maximum time of 5 minutes is typically allowed. Participants unable to complete Part B within 5 minutes are given a score of 300 seconds.","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to weeks 13 and 26"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women and men with either an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke\n* Stroke between the last 7 to 14 days\n* Functional independence before stroke (modified Rankin scale \\<3)\n* Paresis of the lower extremity, upper extremity, or both, with a score \\<3 on the \"motor arm\" item of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scale\n* Ability to stand upright independently or with assistance\n* Ability to understand basic instructions and to decide whether to sign informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Moderate-severe aphasia that precludes understanding the required tasks\n* Cognitive impairment that precludes cooperation with tasks\n* Serious behavioral problems or mental disorders\n* Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, quadriplegia, neurodegenerative diseases, lower limb fractures, or recent myocardial infarction\n* Vital organ (heart, lung, liver, kidney, etc.) failure, malignant tumor, or other unstable condition\n* A history of cerebrovascular disease (if not fully resolved)\n* Photosensitive epilepsy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Alberto Soriano-Maldonado, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"950 01 55 50","email":"asoriano@ual.es"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Alberto Soriano-Maldonado, PhD","affiliation":"Universidad de Almeria","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Almer√≠a","city":"Almeria","state":"Almer√≠a","zip":"04120","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Alberto Soriano Maldonado, PhD","role":"CONTACT","email":"asoriano@ual.es"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":36.83814,"lon":-2.45974}},{"facility":"Torrec√°rdenas University Hospital","city":"Almeria","zip":"04009","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Patricia Mart√≠nez S√°nchez, MD","role":"CONTACT","email":"patrindalo@hotmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":36.83814,"lon":-2.45974}},{"facility":"San Cecilio University Hospital","city":"Granada","zip":"18016","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Inmaculada Villegas Rodr√≠guez, MD","role":"CONTACT","email":"adavillega@gmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.18817,"lon":-3.60667}},{"facility":"University of Granada","city":"Granada","zip":"18071","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Francisco J Amaro-Gahete, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","email":"amarof@ugr.es"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.18817,"lon":-3.60667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"All individual participant data will be shared once the study is finalised and the main results are published.
