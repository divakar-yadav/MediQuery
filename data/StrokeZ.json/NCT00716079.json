About one third of people with ICH die early after onset and the majority of survivors are left with major long-term disability. Despite the magnitude of the disease burden and cost on healthcare resources, there remains uncertainty about the role of surgery for ICH and no acute medical therapies have been shown to definitely alter outcome in ICH.\n\nThe INTERACT2 study follows the recently completed initial pilot study vanguard phase) which established the feasibility of the protocol, safety of early intensive BP lowering, and effects on haematoma expansion within 6 hours of onset of ICH. Having established 'proof-of-concept' that BP lowering may improve outcome by reducing haematoma expansion, INTERACT2 aims to establish the effects of the treatment on major clinical endpoints in patients with ICH recruited from an expanding clinical network around the world."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Cerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke","antihypertensive drugs","blood pressure","disability","clinical trial","outcomes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2839,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive BP lowering","type":"OTHER","description":"Management policy to lower the systolic Blood pressure (BP) to a target of 140mmHg within 1 hour of randomization and sustained for 24 hours.
