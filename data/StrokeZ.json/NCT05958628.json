Depending on the localization of brain damage after stroke, it is possible to talk about different prognoses and therefore different functional losses in the lower extremities, upper extremities and hand and wrist.\n\nToday, various neurophysiological approaches, exercise strategies, electrotherapy modalities and assistive devices are used in the rehabilitation program suitable for the patient after stroke. In addition to these, robot-assisted therapy is gaining a place as an innovative approach in stroke rehabilitation with the developments in technology. Robot-assisted therapy is thought to both facilitate and intensify treatment after stroke and increase motor development.\n\nThe normal functions of the hand, which has many abilities and a complex structure, is extremely important to lead a free and active life. When the literature is examined, the success rate in the recovery of skills and functional recovery of the hand in stroke rehabilitation is low compared to the lower extremity and shoulder joint. More interventions are needed to increase the functional recovery of the hand. Studies should be conducted on robot-assisted treatment methods that allow active and passive exercises in the hand after stroke and contribute to neuroplasticity with an intensified and standardized program.\n\nOur aim in this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Robotic Hand Exoskeleton System developed at Marmara University in order to reduce the physiotherapy process and increase the responses of patients who have partially lost their hand functions due to stroke and need rehabilitation in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Exoskeleton Device","Muscle Spasticity","Quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups; one group will receive conventional physiotherapy and one group will be operated with robotic hand exoskeleton system in addition to conventional physiotherapy.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The outcome assessment will be performed by a investigator who was blinded to group allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Participants in this group will receive a conventional physiotherapy program 3 times a week for 5 weeks, each session lasting 1 hour.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will receive Robotic Hand Exoskeleton System for 10 minutes in addition to 50 minutes of conventional physiotherapy 3 times a week for 5 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physiotherapy","Other: Robotic Hand Exoskeleton System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional physiotherapy","description":"The treatment program was designed in line with the patients' compliance, functional capacities and rehabilitation goals as neurodevelopmental therapy based on the ability to adapt to change, reorganization and healing in the brain by focusing on neuroplasticity from neurodevelopmental treatment approaches; Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques to increase selective and voluntary movement; functional exercises to increase motor control skills, stretching exercises for spasticity and neuromuscular electrical stimulation.\n\nThe control group received conventional physiotherapy exercises for 45 minutes and neuromuscular electrical stimulation for 15 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Intervention group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robotic Hand Exoskeleton System","description":"In the treatment applications with the robotic hand exoskeleton system, which is designed to accelerate the healing process of patients in need of hand rehabilitation, to gain motor skills, to provide strength training and to increase participation in treatment, the patient will be asked to allow the system to move the hand at adjusted angles for 10 minutes and to accompany this movement. In the applications, while the patient is sitting comfortably and safely, the patient will be asked to place the stroke-affected hand into the system.

In addition to 59 questions in 8 sub-sections, it also includes a visual analog scale (0: No improvement, 100: Complete recovery) in which the patient's perception of global recovery after stroke is evaluated with 0-100 points.
