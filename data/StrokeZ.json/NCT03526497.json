Measurement of CVP requires placement of an invasive venous catheter, with insertion of a venous catheter into a central vein to obtain CVP. Catheter placement is invasive, costly and not without complications. Ideally, there would exist a peripheral surrogate for CVP that would be 1) minimally invasive to obtain, 2) low cost and 3) strongly correlate with CVP over a wide range of physiological conditions.\n\nThe peripheral venous system is in continuity with the central venous system and, as such, would be expected to have a pressure that correlates with central venous pressure. Numerous previous studies suggest a correlation between peripheral venous pressure (PVP) and central venous pressure. Prior studies have demonstrated a reasonable correlation between CVP and PVP in patient populations including decompensated heart failure, cardiac and non-cardiac surgery(1), liver transplant donors(2) and recipients(3), neurosurgical(4) and pediatric patients.(5) In an earlier study published by the authors of this paper, the mean difference between PVP and CVP in patients with acute heart failure syndromes was 0.4 mmHg with a correlation coefficient of 0.947. One limitation of the earlier study was that it established this correlation at only one point in time. In the study presented here, PVP and CVP will be obtained and correlation will be assessed across multiple time points during a given patient's hospitalization.\n\nThis is a prospective, single center cohort study to investigate the correlation between peripheral venous pressure and central venous pressure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prospective Studies","Heart Failure"],"keywords":["Catheterization, Peripheral/methods","Humans","Acute Disease","Aged","Female","Male","Follow-Up Studies","Heart Failure/physiopathology","Prospective Studies","Stroke Volume/physiology","Venous Pressure/physiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"In patients admitted to a coronary care unit, what is the correlation coefficient and limits of agreement for paired measurements of PVP and CVP at multiple time points during the patient's hospitalization?","description":"Peripheral Venous Pressure and Central Venous pressure will be measured at three time points across a patient's hospitalization.
