This study will be a randomized controlled trial comprising two groups, an experimental group in which patients will be given short-intensity mCIMT along with conventional therapy. A control group, in which participants will be given conventional therapy alone. Patients will be assessed with the Wolf Motor Function Test, the Motor Activity Log, and the Ashworth Scale before and after treatment. The data will be analyzed by using SPSS for windows software version 25. Statistical significance will be set at p=0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Hemorrhagic Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be allocated into two groups by randomization.

The original version of the WMFT consisted of 21 items.\n\nThe widely used WMFT consists of 17 items.

Participants are asked standardized questions about their high-impact arm usage (amount scale or AS) and quality of movement (how good scale or HW) during a specified functional activity. The scale is printed on a separate sheet and placed in front of the participant during test administration.\n\nParticipants should be told that they can give half marks (i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5) if this reflects their assessment.","timeFrame":"9 months"},{"measure":"The Ashworth scale,","description":"The Ashworth scale, which rates each passive movement between 1 (normal) and 5 (immobility), was used in a recent study and is easier to use than other methods and applicable to wide-range movements.","timeFrame":"9 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients having the First stroke either ischemic or hemorrhagic (3-24 months after stroke)\n* Patients having Mini-mental status examination score (MMSE) ≤23/30\n* Patients having Passive range of motion (PROM) includes at least 90 degrees shoulder flexion and abduction, 45degrees shoulder external rotation,- 30 degrees elbow extension, and 45 degrees forearm supination and pronation (from a neutral position).
