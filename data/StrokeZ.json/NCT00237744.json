This study will compare treatment response to robotics versus functional neuromuscular stimulation.","detailedDescription":"Methods. Up to ninety-six chronic stroke subjects (\\> 12 months post stroke) will be randomized to one of the treatment groups: Wrist/hand Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)+whole arm motor learning group; shoulder/elbow robotics + whole arm motor learning group; and whole arm motor learning group. For all groups, treatment will offered 5 hrs/day, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks. All three treatment groups will receive motor learning therapy. For the Wrist/hand FES+whole arm motor learning group, there will be the addition of FES during treatment. For the Shoulder/elbow robotics + whole arm motor learning group there will be the addition of robotics training. Outcome measures will be collected at weeks 1, 6, 12, and three months after the end of treatment. Measures will include muscle strength (Manual Muscle Testing); coordination of joint movement (Fugl-Meyer Coordination Scale); motor control of target acquisition, pathway maintenance; and smoothness of movement (robotics measures); performance of 13 functional tasks (Arm Motor Ability Test); and quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale). Measures of brain function will be non-invasive and will include cognitive planning time, cognitive effort level, and location of brain activity during simple shoulder and arm movements. Changes in brain function measures will reflect plasticity or adaptability in response to treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke"],"keywords":["Motor Learning","Rehabilitation","Robotics","Therapeutic Electric Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Wrist/Hand FES + Whole Arm Motor Learning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects \\> 6 months following first stroke with diminished upper limb strength, coordination and function, who received whole arm motor learning training and FES of the wrist/hand.","interventionNames":["Device: Surface Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation","Other: whole arm motor learning"]},{"label":"Shoulder/Elbow Robotics + Whole Arm Motor Learning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects\\>6 months following first stroke with diminished upper limb strength, coordination and function, who received whole arm motor learning and shoulder/elbow robotics.","interventionNames":["Device: Robotics training for shoulder elbow.","Other: whole arm motor learning"]},{"label":"Whole Arm Motor Learning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects\\>6 months following first stroke with diminished upper limb strength, coordination and function who received whole arm motor learning training without addition of FES or Robotics","interventionNames":["Other: whole arm motor learning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotics training for shoulder elbow.","description":"training utilizing a robot to assist with movement practice","armGroupLabels":["Shoulder/Elbow Robotics + Whole Arm Motor Learning"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Surface Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation","description":"training utilizing FNS to assist with movement practice","armGroupLabels":["Wrist/Hand FES + Whole Arm Motor Learning"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"whole arm motor learning","description":"intervention utilizing motor learning training principles to perform part and whole task practice of meaningful everyday functional tasks.","armGroupLabels":["Shoulder/Elbow Robotics + Whole Arm Motor Learning","Whole Arm Motor Learning","Wrist/Hand FES + Whole Arm Motor Learning"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"AMAT","description":"The AMAT is a measure of complex functional task performance of a variety of specified tasks and is measured in seconds summed across the various tasks.
