The focus of this study is on the relationship between cognitive abilities and fitness-to-drive.\n\nParticipants will be asked to perform an extended neuropsychological testing and a real life on-road test, conducted by a professional driving instructor. Feedback will be given to the participants on request.","detailedDescription":"The relationship between cognitive abilities and driving skills is really complex. This study aims to introduce novel data analysing methods that can be used by medical professionals to decide whether the stroke patient is able to operate a vehicle safely or not.\n\nThe neuropsychological assessment will involve paper and pencil tests, computerized tests (such as reaction time measurements) and a driving simulator. This part will be approximately 2 hours. Since the first part is really tiresome, the test driving will be on an other day. The driving instructor will guide the participant on a standard route, and will evaluate the performance using standard criteria that will focus mainly on traffic safety.\n\nWho can participate in the study:\n\n* Aged 65 or younger\n* Holds a driving licence\n* Had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke\n* Has sufficient physical abilities to operate a car\n* Does not have certain medical conditions such epilepsy"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Driving Impaired"],"keywords":["fitness to drive","neuropsychology","cognitive","machine learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Patients who suffered ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological testing","Behavioral: On road test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Neuropsychological testing","description":"The neuropsychological assessment will involve paper and pencil tests, computerized tests (such as reaction time measurements) and a driving simulator.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"On road test","description":"The driving instructor will guide the participant on a standard route, and will evaluate the performance using standard criteria that will focus mainly on traffic safety.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Driving test result","description":"The driving instructor's classification (pass/fail)","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 65 or younger\n* ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke\n* at least 6 months has passed after the stroke\n* holds a valid driver's licence\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* visual impairments (eg. visual field loss, nystagmus or diplopia)\n* epilepsy\n* serious movement disorders (eg. hemiplegia) that hider operating a car\n* limb ataxia\n* aphasia types that affect comprehension\n* serious psychiatrical disorders","sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients of the National Institute for Medical Rehabilitation, Budapest, Hungary","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Gábor Fazekas, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+3613911946","email":"fazekas.gabor@omint.hu"},{"name":"Gábor Szabó","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+3613911900","phoneExt":"1311","email":"szabo.gabor@omint.hu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gábor Fazekas, MD, PhD","affiliation":"National Institute for Medical Rehabilitation, Hungary","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"National Institute for Medical Rehabilitation","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Budapest","zip":"1121","country":"Hungary","contacts":[{"name":"Gábor Fazekas, MD habil PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+3613911946","email":"fazekas.gabor@omint.hu"},{"name":"Gábor Szabó","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+3613911900","phoneExt":"1311","email":"szabo.gabor@omint.hu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.49801,"lon":19.03991}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
