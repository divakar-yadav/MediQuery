The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of glyburide (RP-1127) compared to placebo in participants with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who are likely to develop malignant edema.This objective will be addressed by comparing the proportion of glyburide treated particpants and placebo treated participants with a Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 4 without decompressive craniectomy (DC). The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of RP-1127 compared to placebo in participants with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who were likely to develop malignant edema.","detailedDescription":"The study population consists of participants with a clinical diagnosis of acute severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke, a baseline diffusion weighted image (DWI) lesion between 82 and 300 cm3, age 18-80 years, and time from symptom onset to start of study infusion of ≤10 hours. The study will enroll both participants that do not receive intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and those that receive IV rtPA within 4.5 hours of stroke.\n\nEnrollment will be randomized controlling for site, age ≤60 (yes/no), and IV rtPA treatment at baseline (yes/no). Participants will be randomized equally between glyburide and placebo.\n\nThis study was previously posted by Remedy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and has since been acquired by Biogen."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Malignant Edema"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":86,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Matching Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants received a bolus dose of matching placebo over 2 minutes, followed by a continuous matching placebo infusion for 72 hours.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Glyburide for Injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants received a 0.13 mg bolus dose of glyburide over 2 minutes, followed by a 0.16 mg/hr continuous infusion for 6 hours and than a 0.11 mg/hr for 66 hours for a total dosing period of 72 hours.","interventionNames":["Drug: Glyburide for Injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Glyburide for Injection","description":"Administered as specified in the treatment arm.","armGroupLabels":["Glyburide for Injection"],"otherNames":["RP-1127","glibenclamide","glybenclamide"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Administered as specified in the treatment arm.","armGroupLabels":["Matching Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Participants with a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 4 Without Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)","description":"The mRS scale runs from 0-6, the scoring is as follows: 0 - No symptoms, 1 - No significant disability, 2 - Slight disability, 3 - Moderate disability, 4 - Moderately severe disability, 5 - Severe disability, 6 - Dead","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Number of Participants with Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events","description":"An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.
