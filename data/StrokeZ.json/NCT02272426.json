In addition, many stroke patients do not get regular exercise and are often sedentary. Both physical and cognitive exercise have the potential to improve quality of life, cognition, and overall health, but the safety and tolerability of such interventions is not clear in stroke patients. The investigators will examine these outcomes by allocating stroke survivor participants to one of two groups: a combined exercise and cognitive training program and a sham control group.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is well recognized as the leading cause of disability in the United States. Cognitive deficits after stroke are common, even in those without dementia prior to the event, and stroke patients with worse cognition on hospital admission have worse outcomes. Cognitive deficits contribute to stroke-related disability and mortality. Evidence suggests an interaction between cognitive deficits and physical limitations, and cognitive rehabilitation may improve functional outcomes post stroke. Recent data also suggest that both cognitive training and exercise interventions improve cognition in stroke patients, but few randomized trials of these interventions, alone or in combination, have been conducted.\n\nWe will study the effects of a Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training (CARET) program and CTI interventions on the primary outcome of safety, feasibility, and adherence among ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke survivors with mild to moderate disability. We hypothesize that these interventions are safe and tolerable, and that they will lead to improvements in our secondary outcomes of cognitive performance and quality of life. We will also explore the role of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor in cognitive changes related to the physical exercise intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Exercise Training","Cognitive Training","Quality of Life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":132,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CARET + CTI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training (CARET) plus Cognitive Training Intervention (CTI)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: CARET","Behavioral: CTI"]},{"label":"Sham CARET + Sham CTI","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group Sham Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training (CARET) plus Sham Cognitive Training Intervention (CTI)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sham CARET","Behavioral: Sham CTI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"CARET","description":"Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training","armGroupLabels":["CARET + CTI"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"CTI","description":"Cognitive Training Intervention","armGroupLabels":["CARET + CTI"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sham CARET","description":"Sham Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training","armGroupLabels":["Sham CARET + Sham CTI"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sham CTI","description":"Sham Cognitive Training Intervention","armGroupLabels":["Sham CARET + Sham CTI"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with treatment emergent serious adverse events","description":"To assess the number of participants with serious adverse events related to the interventions, comparing active groups versus the sham group.","timeFrame":"At 12 weeks visit (post-intervention)"},{"measure":"Adherence to a 12-week combined exercise and cognitive training protocol versus a sham group","description":"To assess participant adherence in the intervention group versus the sham group, comparing time on study.","timeFrame":"At 12 weeks visit (post-intervention)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Cognitive Performance on cognitive neuropsychological battery done at pre, post and 6 month follow-up visits","description":"Global cognitive performance will be compared for the intervention groups versus the sham group, using a cognitive assessment battery.","timeFrame":"Baseline to 6 months follow up"},{"measure":"Change in Health Related Quality of Life - Depression","description":"As measured by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).
