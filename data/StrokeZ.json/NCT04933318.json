There are publications about the use of TENS and interferential currents (IFC) in the treatment of hemiplegia related shoulder pain and their effectiveness. However when we look at the literature, we did not find a study that evaluated the efficacy of TENS and IFC in hemiplegic shoulder pain. For this reason, in this study, we aimed to determine the effects of these analgesic treatment modalities on the patient's pain, functional status and shoulder range of motion (ROM) in these patients. 60 stroke patients with shoulder pain randomized to four treatment groups. 15 patients in Group 1 were given TENS treatment to the shoulder area for 25 minutes by conventional method ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program was applied under the guidance of a physiotherapist.. 15 patients in Group 2 were given shamTENS treatment to the shoulder area for 25 minutes ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program was applied under the guidance of a physiotherapist.15 patients in Group 3 were given 100 Hz IFC treatment to the shoulder area for 25 minutes ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program was applied under the guidance of a physiotherapist. 15 patients in Group 4 were given shamIFC treatment to the shoulder area for 25 minutes ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program was applied under the guidance of a physiotherapist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Exercise","TENS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)- analgesic current therapy","interventionNames":["Other: TENS"]},{"label":"shamTENS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"shamTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)- analgesic current therapy","interventionNames":["Other: shamTENS"]},{"label":"Interferential current therapy (IFC)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Interferential current therapy (IFC)- analgesic current therapy","interventionNames":["Other: IFC"]},{"label":"shamIFC","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"shamInterferential current therapy (IFC)- analgesic current therapy","interventionNames":["Other: shamIFC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"TENS","description":"Transcutaneus electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)- analgesic current therapy","armGroupLabels":["Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"shamTENS","description":"shamTranscutaneus electrical nerve stimulation (shamTENS)- analgesic current therapy","armGroupLabels":["shamTENS"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"IFC","description":"Interferential current therapy (IFC)- analgesic current therapy","armGroupLabels":["Interferential current therapy (IFC)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"shamIFC","description":"shamInterferential current therapy (shamIFC)- analgesic current therapy","armGroupLabels":["shamIFC"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline VAS (visual analog scale) at 4th and 8th week","description":"The patients were asked to make an assesment of their pain level between 0 and 10 scale","timeFrame":"up to 8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline quality of life (short form 36) at 4th and 8th week","description":"The physical and mental health summary scores were the primary components used.
