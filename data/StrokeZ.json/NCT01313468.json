The primary aim of the study is to investigate if 10 weeks of exercise training increase NEAT in sedentary men.\n\nSubject will be randomized to three different training intervention, with 3 exercise session each week for 10 weeks. NEAT will be measured using an activity sensor and recorded over a 7 day period both before and after training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy Subjects"],"keywords":["NEAT","maximal oxygen uptake","stroke volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"4 x 4 Interval","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"4 x 4 minutes of high intensity intervals at 90-95% of maximal heart rate separated by 3 minutes of active brakes in between at 70% of maximal heart rate.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: 4 x 4 minutes Intervals"]},{"label":"1 4 minutes interval","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1 x 4 minutes intervals at 90-95% of HR max","interventionNames":["Behavioral: 1 x 4 minute interval"]},{"label":"Moderate continuous Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"47 minutes of Moderate continuous Training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Moderate continuous Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"1 x 4 minute interval","description":"1 x 4 minutes of high intensity intervals at 90-95% of maximal heart rate","armGroupLabels":["1 4 minutes interval"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"4 x 4 minutes Intervals","description":"4 x 4 minutes of high intensity intervals at 90-95% of maximal heart rate separated by 3 minutes of active brakes in between at 70% of maximal heart rate.","armGroupLabels":["4 x 4 Interval"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Moderate continuous Training","description":"47 minutes of Moderate continuous Training","armGroupLabels":["Moderate continuous Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"nonexercise activity thermogenesis","description":"NEAT Will be measured using an activity sensor.
