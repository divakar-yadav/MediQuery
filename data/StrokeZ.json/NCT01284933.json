Non-invasive high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) of the carotid artery allows detecting vulnerable plaques (VP) and quantifying single plaque components. The hypotheses behind this study are that i) a substantial proportion of cases of AIS and TIA within the anterior circulation and no identified cause (cryptogenic AIS or TIA) are caused by VP in the carotid artery; ii) that these patients are at a high risk of developing a recurrent stroke, TIA, or clinically silent lesions detectable by brain MRI; and iii) that VP in the carotid artery are associated with specific infarct patterns as detected by diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Finally, the investigators will search for biomarkers associated with vulnerable carotid artery plaques. Motivating this study are the following considerations: i) data on the frequency and characteristics of VP in patients with cryptogenic AIS or TIA will provide valuable insights into stroke mechanisms; ii) depending on the results this study may have implications for diagnostic decision making and provide the basis for the planning of targeted interventional studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Attack, Transient"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemic Attack, Transient","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Carotid Arteries","Carotid Artery Plaque","Atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"whole blood, serum, plasma, RNA"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":234,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute Ischemic Stroke, TIA","description":"Patients admitted to a specialized stroke service because of an acute ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA)."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency and characteristics of vulnerable plaques (VP) in the carotid artery ipsilateral to an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or TIA in the territory of the carotid artery in patients with a cryptogenic stroke","description":"For the primary outcome, definition of a VP will be based on non-invasive high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
