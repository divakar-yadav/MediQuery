Individuals who have sustained stroke are often left with residual motor deficits of the upper limb. These deficits restrict functional use of the limb in everyday activities and can result in increased dependen cy upon others to engage in some tasks.\n\nObjectives Present study aims to see effectiveness of mirror therapy and Motor Relearning Programme for improving hand functions in stroke.\n\nMaterials and Methods Present study was an experimental study conducted on 12 stroke patients using convenient sampling method .Subjects were divided into two equal groups (n=6). Group A was given conventional physiotherapy and Motor Relearning Programme exercises for the affected hand and Group B received conventional physiotherapy for the affected hand and mirror therapy for the unaffected hand.
