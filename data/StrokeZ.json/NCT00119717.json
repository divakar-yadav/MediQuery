The NeuroFlo device is intended to increase blood flow to the brain and potentially reduce the damage caused by stroke.","detailedDescription":"The study is a prospective, controlled, randomized, single-blind, multi-center study of NeuroFlo treatment plus standard medical management versus standard medical management alone. Randomization will be 1:1 and stratified to ensure equivalent patient distribution between treatment and control for the following key parameters:\n\n1. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline (stratify \\<10, 11-18)\n2. Time from symptom onset (TFSO) to time of baseline NIHSS evaluation (stratify \\<5 hrs, or ≥5 hrs)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["acute","ischemic","stroke","randomized","device","treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":515,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: NeuroFlo™ catheter"]},{"label":"2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NeuroFlo™ catheter","description":"45 minute treatment","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control","description":"ASA Guidelines","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The safety of the NeuroFlo device and procedure will be compared to medical management alone","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Efficacy will be assessed using a global outcome score","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Acute improvement in neurological function","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","timeFrame":"30 & 90 days"},{"measure":"Hospital length of stay","timeFrame":"Varies"},{"measure":"Patient disposition upon discharge will be compared","timeFrame":"Varies"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke\n* NIHSS between 5-18\n* Time from symptom onset less than 14 hours\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hemorrhagic stroke\n* Certain types of heart disease\n* Kidney disease\n* Other conditions the doctor will assess","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ashfaq Shuaib, MD","affiliation":"University of Alberta, Edmonton","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Huntsville Hospital","city":"Huntsville","state":"Alabama","zip":"35801","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":34.7304,"lon":-86.58594}},{"facility":"UCLA","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California","zip":"90024","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":34.05223,"lon":-118.24368}},{"facility":"Good Samaritan Hospital","city":"San Jose","state":"California","zip":"95124","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.33939,"lon":-121.89496}},{"facility":"Morton Plant Hospital","city":"Clearwater","state":"Florida","zip":"33756","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":27.96585,"lon":-82.8001}},{"facility":"University of Florida","city":"Jacksonville","state":"Florida","zip":"32209","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":30.33218,"lon":-81.65565}},{"facility":"Univ. of Miami","city":"Miami","state":"Florida","zip":"33136","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":25.77427,"lon":-80.19366}},{"facility":"Munroe Regional Medical Center","city":"Ocala","state":"Florida","zip":"34471","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":29.1872,"lon":-82.14009}},{"facility":"Sarasota Memorial Hospital","city":"Sarasota","state":"Florida","zip":"34329","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":27.33643,"lon":-82.53065}},{"facility":"The Queen's Medical Center","city":"Honolulu","state":"Hawaii","zip":"96813","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":21.30694,"lon":-157.85833}},{"facility":"Advocate Lutheran General Hospital","city":"Park Ridge","state":"Illinois","zip":"60068","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.01114,"lon":-87.84062}},{"facility":"Central DuPage Hospital","city":"Winfield","state":"Illinois","zip":"60190","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.8617,"lon":-88.1609}},{"facility":"Central Baptist Hospital","city":"Lexington","state":"Kentucky","zip":"40503","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.98869,"lon":-84.47772}},{"facility":"University of Louisville","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zip":"40202","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.25424,"lon":-85.75941}},{"facility":"Michigan State University","city":"Lansing","state":"Michigan","zip":"48824","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.73253,"lon":-84.55553}},{"facility":"St. Joseph Mercy -
