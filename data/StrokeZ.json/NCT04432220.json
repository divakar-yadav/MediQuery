However, anticoagulation can increase the risk of bleeding, the study evaluating the role of oral anticoagulation is needed in this patients. This study will compare the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in patient with sinus rhythm one year after catheter ablation of AF.","detailedDescription":"This study is a prospective randomized study which was performed in multicenter (General Hospital) in Korea. Inclusion criteria is atrial fibrillation patients with moderate or high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc\\>=1 male, and \\>=2 female) who had undergone catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, and has maintained sinus rhythm for more than 1 year. Anticoagulation (Apixaban group) will take apixaban (5 mg bid or 2.5 mg bid according to dose guideline) for 2 years, and nonanticoagulation group will not take any oral anticoagulants for the same period. If the patients have the recurrence of AF, they will take anticoagulation according to standard treatment, and will be censored. We will analyze and compare the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in these patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation Patients With Moderate or High Stroke Risk Who Had Undergone Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["catheter ablation","anticoagulation","efficacy","safety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":840,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Apixaban 5mg twice daily (2.5mg twice daily if meets dose-reduction criteria) for 2 years","interventionNames":["Drug: Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)"]},{"label":"Nonanticoagulation group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard treatment except anticoagulant for 2 years"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)","description":"Apixaban 5mg twice daily (2.5mg twice daily if meets dose-reduction criteria) for 2 years","armGroupLabels":["Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke","description":"Ischemic stroke specifically refers to central nervous system infarction (brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia) accompanied by overt symptoms, while silent infarction by definition causes no known symptoms.
