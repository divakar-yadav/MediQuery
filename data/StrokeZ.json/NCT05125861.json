The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis. The control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis . Both groups underwent dynamic cerebral autoregulation measurements at days 1 to 2 and 7 to 10 of onset and recorded the relevant indexes, and blood samples were collected before and 24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, we aimed to determine the impact of remote ischemic conditioning combined with intravenous thrombolysis on dynamic cerebral autoregulation in acute ischemic stroke patients. We hypothesized that remote ischemic conditioning would improve dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving intravenous thrombolysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Remote Ischemic Conditioning"],"keywords":["Remote Ischemic Conditioning","Dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"RIC+Standard medical treatment Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is induced by 4 cycles of 5 min of healthy upper limb ischemia followed by 5 min re-perfusion.
