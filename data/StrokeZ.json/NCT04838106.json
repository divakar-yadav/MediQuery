Outcomes will be compared with patients admitted as an emergency to an ICU for other conditions. The study will use existing national audit data linked to routine healthcare datasets.","detailedDescription":"Across England and Wales, over 10,000 patients have been treated for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on an intensive care unit. Around 60% survived to leave hospital. It is unknown how survivors' severe COVID-19 infection, or the treatment they received on the intensive care unit, will affect their long-term health. Understanding what happens to these patients can help ensure they receive suitable care from their General Practitioner (GP) and other National Health Service (NHS) services after they leave hospital.\n\nThis study will follow up survivors for 1 year after discharge from hospital. The investigators will use data collected by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) to identify patients who were treated on an ICU for COVID-19. The investigators will then use NHS data to see whether these patients were readmitted to hospital and why. Information from the Office of National Statistics will identify whether patients died. By linking different sources of patient data, the investigators will estimate the health risks faced by survivors of severe COVID-19. These risks will be compared to those in patients treated on an ICU for other conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Covid19","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Critical Illness","Heart
