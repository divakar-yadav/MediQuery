The only food and drug administration (FDA) approved therapy for acute stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). But narrow therapeutic window has limited the usefulness of thrombolytic therapy. Therefore, finding effective neuroprotective drugs for the patients for whom thrombolysis is contraindicated or not feasible seemed to be mandatory in the world of cerebrovascular medicine.\n\nLicorice, extracted from root of a plant scientifically known as Glycyrrhiza glabra, is used in food industries. Certain medical properties has been contributed to licorice and specifically to its active chemical components such as flavonoids and glycyrrhizic acid (GA). GA has been revealed to assert its anti-inflammatory effect by suppression of NF-ÎºB, a key component of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response. Neuroprotective characteristics of GA has been widely investigated in recent studies.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators verified the efficacy and safety of oral administration of two different doses licorice extract in the patients with acute ischemic stroke, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Licorice","Glycyrrhizic acid","Ischemic Stroke","Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"patients with acute ischemic stroke who received standard care plus placebo filled capsules,","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"450 mg licorice","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients with acute ischemic stroke who received standard care plus capsules filled with 450 mg of whole extract of licorice.","interventionNames":["Drug: Licorice whole extract"]},{"label":"900 mg licorice","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients with acute ischemic stroke who received standard care plus capsules filled with 900 mg of whole extract of licorice.","interventionNames":["Drug: Licorice whole extract"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Licorice whole extract","description":"Patients randomly received one of below capsules labeled with codes during the first 24 hours after stroke attack:\n\n1.
