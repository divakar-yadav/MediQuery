Half of the participants will receive access to the digital (online) programme, half will receive a leaflet with sleep hygiene information. The primary outcome will be changes in sleep quality, assessed as the score on the Sleep Condition Indicator.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability. Many stroke survivors report difficulties with sleep and our current research confirms this, indicating that chronic community dwelling stroke survivors experience poorer self-reported and objective sleep quality than age matched healthy controls.\n\n\"Sleepio\" is an online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) programme. The efficacy of this intervention has been demonstrated in people with chronic insomnia but has not yet been tested in people with stroke. The study therefore aims to determine whether digital CBT-I is effective for improving sleep quality in chronic stroke survivors. Participants will be randomised to receive either digital (online) CBT-I or a leaflet with sleep hygiene information. The primary outcome is the change in self-reported sleep quality, assessed using the Sleep Condition Indicator. Secondary outcomes include changes in sleep fragmentation and wake after sleep onset assessed with actigraphy, self-reported sleep onset latency from the sleep diaries, anxiety and depression using the PHQ9 and GAD7, quality of life using the SIS-8 and EQ-5D-5L as well as changes in healthcare costs during the 8 week follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Sleep","Rehabilitation","Digital","Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for
