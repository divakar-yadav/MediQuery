Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 years and older\n* Pre-stroke independent functional status in activities of daily living with modified Rankin Score 0-1\n* Patient presenting with a disabling stroke device as NIHSS ≥6\n* Thrombolytic therapy (IV tPA), if indicated/administered, was initiated within 3 hours of onset/ last known well according to prescribed dosing.Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated (groin puncture) \\<24 hours from onset of symptoms or last known well time.\n* Confirmed symptomatic large vessel occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery, M1 or proximal M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery.\n* The following image criteria should also be met:\n\nFor Subjects 0-6hrs onset:\n\n* MRI Criterion: volume of diffusion restriction as assessed by automated core volume software ≤50mL OR\n* CT Criterion: ASPECTS 6-10 on baseline CT or CTA-source images or, CPT as assessed by automated core volume software ≤50mL\n\nFor subjects 6-24hrs onset:\n\n* ≤20mL Ischemic core volume if age \\>80\n* ≤30mL Ischemic core volume if age \\<80 and NIHSS 10-20\n* ≤50mL Ischemic core volume if age \\<80 and NIHSS \\>20\n* Signed informed consent from patient or legal authorized representative.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* CT or MRI evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on presentation.\n* CT or MRI showing mass effect or intracranial tumor (meningioma \\>2cm in diameter)\n* CT or MRI evidence of carotid dissection or complete cervical carotid occlusion requiring a stent.\n* Previous stroke within the past 3 months.\n* Known arterial condition (proximal vessel stenosis or pre-existing stent) that would prevent the study devices from reaching the target vessel and/or preclude safe recovery of the study devices.\n* Pregnancy.\n* Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.\n* Rapidly improving neurological status as determined by Investigator/Neurologist.\n* Renal failure/insufficiency with \\>3.0 mg/dL creatinine prior to procedure.\n* Severe, sustained hypertension resistant to treatment (SBP\\>185mmHg or DBP \\>110mmHg)\n* Use of warfarin anticoagulation with International Normalized Ratio (INR) \\>3.0 at the time of the procedure or any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency.\n* For patients who have received a direct thrombin inhibitor within the last 48hrs; partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\> 2.0 times the normal prior to procedure.\n* Platelet count \\< 50,000\n* Cerebral vasculitis or evidence of active systemic infection (including COVID-19)\n* Suspicion of aortic dissection, septic embolus, or bacterial endocarditis.\n* Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).\n* Seizure due to stroke.\n* Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic.\n* Active participation in another study involving an investigational drug or device.\n* A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.\n* Unwillingness to complete follow up visits.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Adnan Siddiqui,
