The treatment group will use an emulsion containing 8% w/w menthol, with an average of 80 grams placed inside hand and foot wraps (20 grams in each hand or foot wrap). The control group, on the other hand, will use an emulsion that does not contain any menthol, with an average of 80 grams placed inside hand and foot wraps. Participants in this study will initially undergo a detailed regular neurological examination, an assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI) for daily living functions, and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for disability. All participants will be re-evaluated after the fourth and eighth weeks of the trial, with assessments including neurological examination, NIHSS, BI, and mRS.","detailedDescription":"Sixty patients with acute ischemic stroke were randomly divided into two groups: thirty in the treatment group and thirty in the control group.\n\nParticipants in this study will initially undergo a detailed regular neurological examination, an assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI) for daily living functions, and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for disability. After completing the basic assessments and signing the informed consent, participants will be randomly allocated to either the treatment group or the control group for the trial.\n\nThe treatment group will use an emulsion containing 8% w/w menthol, with an average of 80 grams placed inside hand and foot wraps (20 grams in each hand or foot wrap). Participants will wear the wraps for five minutes before removal. This process will be done once a day for five consecutive days in a week, followed by two days of rest, and will last for four weeks.\n\nThe control group, on the other hand, will use an emulsion that does not contain any menthol, with an average of 80 grams placed inside hand and foot wraps.
