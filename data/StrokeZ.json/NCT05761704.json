Bleeding events and stroke should be reduced while reducing thrombosis. Based on the characteristics of the LAMax LAAC® device, experts recommend studying short-term medication regimens for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation after LAAC. This trial is a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label and parallel design. It is estimated that 54 patients will take part in the study. Subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation undergo transcatheter LAAC using the LAMax LAAC® device, and then are randomly enrolled in observation group 1/observation group 2 of the medication regimen in a 1:1 ratio after LAAC.\n\nObservation group 1 (dual antiplatelet group, 27 subjects): 4 weeks post-LAAC (aspirin 100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg); 4-24 weeks post-LAAC (aspirin/clopidogrel); recommended long-term aspirin treatment after 24 weeks (clopidogrel can be used instead if aspirin is intolerant).\n\nObservation group 2 (novel oral anticoagulant group, 27 subjects): 4 weeks post-LAAC (conventional dose NOAC); 4-24 weeks post-LAAC (aspirin/clopidogrel); recommended long-term aspirin treatment after 24 weeks (clopidogrel can be used instead if aspirin is intolerant)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Left Atrial Appendage Closure","Ischemic Stroke","Device-related Thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual antiplatelet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Aspirin 100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg for 4 weeks post-LAAC;
