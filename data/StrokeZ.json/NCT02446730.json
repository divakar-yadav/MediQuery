Follow-up data will be collected until 1-year after index procedure.\n\nPrimary efficacy end-point defined as the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal MI, stent thrombosis and ischemic driven target vessel revascularization and safety end-points as BARC (the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) type ≥ 2 bleeding."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Death","Hemorrhage","Cerebrovascular
