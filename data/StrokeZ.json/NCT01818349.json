A mismatch between the training program and gait parameters could explain this finding.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the impact of an isokinetic-strengthening program, matching the requirements of the affected lower-limb muscle groups involved in the energy generation of gait, to a control intervention, on gait performance and muscle strength.\n\nHypothesis: The isokinetic training program of the affected lower-limb muscles would produce greater changes in gait performance and strength than a control intervention not aiming at training these muscle groups.\n\nDesign: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial.\n\nParticipants: A convenient sample of 30 individuals with chronic hemiparesis.\n\nInterventions: Participants were randomly assigned into two groups (n=15), each training three times/week for six weeks. The experimental group trained the affected plantarflexors, hip flexors and extensors concentrically, while the control group trained the affected upper-limb muscles.\n\nMain outcome measures: Baseline values and post-training values, taken at the end of the training program, of maximal voluntary concentric strength, gait speed and peak positive power."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","exercise","muscle strength","gait","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"isokinetic lower-limb training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3 times/week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: isokinetic lower-limb training"]},{"label":"isokinetic uppe-limb training","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"3 times/week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: isokinetic upper-limb training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"isokinetic lower-limb training","description":"concentric training of the affected plantarflexors, hip flexors and hip extensors","armGroupLabels":["isokinetic lower-limb training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"isokinetic upper-limb training","description":"concentric training of the affected wrist extensors, elbow flexors and shoulder flexors","armGroupLabels":["isokinetic uppe-limb training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in gait speed","description":"change in gait speed, in meter/second, was assessed as the difference between the baseline and week #7 values.","timeFrame":"gait speed was assessed at baseline and at the completion of the 6-week training (i.e. week #7)"},{"measure":"change in peak positive power","description":"peak positive power was evaluated at the affected plantarflexors, hip flexors and hip extensors.
