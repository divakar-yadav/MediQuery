Intraoperative technical limitations limiting or impeding the arterial re-opening\n2. Persistent low quality of the arterial signal. After positioning the patient and zeroing the arterial signal, the arterial waveform is checked for quality by means of a square-wave test and optimized in the case of the occurrence of under or over-damping.","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Humanitas Research Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Rozzano","state":"Milano","zip":"20089","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Antonio Messina, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+390282241","email":"antonio.messina@humanitas.it"},{"name":"Antonio Messina, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+3902822414131","email":"mess81rc@gmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.38193,"lon":9.1559}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study will be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
