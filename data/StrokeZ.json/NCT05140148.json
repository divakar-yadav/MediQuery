This will be a blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT). Patients will be randomized post-ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke either to the placebo arm or amantadine arm. Patients will be on study drug or placebo for 1 month but will be enrolled for 3 months total. At various time points patients will be examined and fill out questionnaires to determine level of stroke recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"placebo pill, twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Amantadine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"100 mg amantadine twice daily, or if 65 years or older once daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Amantadine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Amantadine","description":"Amantadine is a antiviral drug and dopamine promoter that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of influenza A and Parkinson's Disease","armGroupLabels":["Amantadine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"placebo pills","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]","description":"Tolerability of the study drug will be assessed based on the proportion of patients who adherent with at least 80% of study medication.","timeFrame":"Day 90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Global rating on the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)","description":"Patient reported measure of stroke recovery; Stroke Impact Scale has 59 items in 8 domains (each domain score ranges from 0-100) And a 9th domain that is an overall scale from 0-100.
