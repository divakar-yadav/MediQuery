Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols in a polarity and site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. So far, several pilot studies have reported beneficial results from tDCS in both subacute and chronic stroke patients, but it's still unclear how tDCS should be repeated over multiple days to optimally enhance recovery and training effects. Using a late LTP-like plasticity protocol could increase effectiveness of standard clinical care rehabilitation sessions and thus enhance the effects of rehabilitation. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects rehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. The outcome of this study can provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.\n\nObjective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity on motor rehabilitation during the subacute phase after stroke.\n\nStudy design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Subacute stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is the upper limb motor function during the subacute phase after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sham","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Motor training of the affected upper extremity combined with sham tDCS.","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]},{"label":"tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Motor training of the affected upper extremity combined with dual transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"Late LTP-like plasticity tDCS (2 times per week) for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Sham","tDCS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Assessment","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ARAT","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Hand grip strength","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"10-meter walk test","timeFrame":"Baseline; 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"EuroQol-5D","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Barthel Index","timeFrame":"Baseline; 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"HADS","timeFrame":"Baseline; 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"MoCA","timeFrame":"Baseline; 4 weeks and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale","timeFrame":"Every stimulation session"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subacute stroke (within 1-4 weeks post stroke)\n* Acute hemiparesis (Fugl-Meyer Stage \\< IV) with single thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic infarction documented by a neurologist\n* Aged 18-79\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Absence of voluntary movement (Fugl-Meyer Stage \\< III)\n* Head injury or the presence of intracranial metal or intracranial lesions\n* History of cranial irradiation\n* History of epilepsy\n* Presence of a pacemaker\n* Taking anticonvulsant or neuroleptic medication\n* Substance abuse\n* Inability to understand instructions","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"79 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Rick van der Vliet, MSc","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+31622857402","email":"r.vandervliet@erasmusmc.nl"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rijndam","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Rotterdam","state":"Zuid-Holland","zip":"3015LJ","country":"Netherlands","contacts":[{"name":"Gerard Ribbers, PhD MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+31102412411","email":"gribbers@rijndam.nl"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.9225,"lon":4.47917}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33175411","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Elsner B, Kugler J, Pohl M, Mehrholz J.
