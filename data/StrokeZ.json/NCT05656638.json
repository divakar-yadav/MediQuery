The main objective is to examine whether the therapy improves grammatical time marking of inflected verbs treated on the sessions. We also explore whether the observed progress can be transferred to untrained items, more ecological contexts and if is maintained two and four weeks after the end of treatment.\n\nThis therapy will be administered to nine individuals with brain lesions after stroke. Five individuals will take part of the individual therapy and four individuals will take part of the group therapy (two individuals per group). The therapy will last one month, at the rate of three weekly sessions of approximately one hour."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injury, Vascular","Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Brain-injured participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants with post-stroke fluent or non-fluent chronic aphasia","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speech and language therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Speech and language therapy","description":"The treatment focuses on grammatical time marking. The aim of the treatment is to train underlying grammatical time marking processes, which were identified as deficient during a preliminary evaluation. The intervention is composed of 4 steps inspired by models and hypotheses from the literature on the subject. Step 1: \"temporal adverbial selection\", subject must identify the tense encoded in sentences and select the correct adverbial among those proposed. Step 2: \"selection of inflected verb forms\", subject must identify the tense encoded in the sentence and select the correct verb form among those proposed. Step 3: \"production of inflected verb forms\", subject must identify the tense encoded in the sentence and produce inflected verbs. Step 4: \"semantic narration\", subject must describe scenes using verbs inflected according to the previously defined reference time.","armGroupLabels":["Brain-injured participants"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from the score on an inflected verb production task after the end of the therapy: treated items","description":"The inflected verb production task evaluates subject's ability to produce an inflected verb form according to time context given by a short sentence.
