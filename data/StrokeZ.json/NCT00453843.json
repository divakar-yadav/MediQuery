Test whether task specific wrist robotic training improves motor performance among persons with chronic impairment after stroke.\n\nSpecific Aim 2. Test whether the order in which robot therapy is delivered influences outcomes (shoulder-and-elbow before wrist vs. wrist before shoulder-and-elbow).\n\nSpecific Aim 3. Test whether there is generalization across different joints (shoulder \\& elbow vs wrist).\n\nSpecific Aim 4: Test whether there is any interference between training across different joints among persons with chronic impairment after stroke.\n\nBriefly we will invite persons with chronic impairment due to stroke to participate in a study that will train them first on wrist for 6 weeks and then on the shoulder-and-elbow for an additional 6 weeks or vice-versa. A third group will train in alternate days for 12 weeks on the shoulder-and-elbow or the wrist, while a fourth group will be trained on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist on the same day. Outcomes will be measured using standard instruments as well as robot-based measures. We expect that results from this study will provide an objective basis for maximizing this kind of therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","movement therapy","robotics","rehabilitation robotics","shoulder, elbow, wrist"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":190,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"proximal to distal training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: rehabilitation robotics","Procedure: Movement therapy"]},{"label":"distal to proximal","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: rehabilitation robotics","Procedure: Movement therapy"]},{"label":"proximal and distal on alternate days","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: rehabilitation robotics","Procedure: Movement therapy"]},{"label":"proximal and distal same day","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: rehabilitation robotics","Procedure: Movement therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"rehabilitation robotics","description":"sequence of intervention","armGroupLabels":["distal to proximal","proximal and distal on alternate days","proximal and distal same day","proximal to distal training"],"otherNames":["InMotion2.0 (InMotion Arm) and InMotion3.0 (InMotion Wrist)"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Movement therapy","description":"sequence of intervention","armGroupLabels":["distal to proximal","proximal and distal on alternate days","proximal and distal same day","proximal to distal training"],"otherNames":["InMotion2.0 (InMotion Arm) and InMotion3.0 (InMotion Wrist)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer","timeFrame":"3 times at baseline, midpoint, completion intervention, and at follow-up"},{"measure":"Motor Power","timeFrame":"3 times at baseline, midpoint, completion intervention, and at follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function","timeFrame":"3 times at baseline, midpoint, completion intervention, and at follow-up"},{"measure":"SIS","timeFrame":"3 times at baseline, midpoint, completion intervention, and at follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients will be included in the study if they meet the following criteria:\n\n1. naÃ¯ve subjects who have never experienced robot-assisted therapy as inpatients or outpatients;\n2. first single focal unilateral lesion with diagnosis verified by brain imaging (MRI or CT scans) that has occurred at least 6 months prior;\n3. cognitive function sufficient to understand the experiments and follow instructions (Mini-Mental Status Score of 22 and higher or interview for aphasic subjects);\n4. average Motor Power score \\>= 1/5 or \\<= 3/5 (neither hemiplegic nor fully recovered motor function in 6 muscles of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist);\n5. informed written consent to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study if they have a fixed contraction deformity in the affected limb.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hermano I Krebs, PhD","affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Burke Medical Research Institute","city":"White Plains","state":"New York","zip":"10605","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.03399,"lon":-73.76291}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
