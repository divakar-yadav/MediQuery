In addition to the absolute age, effects on higher age-related risk factors on relative risk of apixaban to warfarin is also investigated through subgroup analyses.","detailedDescription":"This is a retrospective non-intervention observational study to evaluate the difference in safety and effectiveness between apixaban and warfarin using a database provided by Medical Data Vision Co. Ltd. (MDV Co. Ltd.). Eligible patients will be extracted from the database and allocated to the pre-defined cohorts based on the actual age, age of NVAF diagnosis and types of anticoagulant therapy.\n\nPatient characteristics will be balanced by an Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method, and risk of stroke/SE (primary effectiveness endpoint) and major bleeding (primary safety endpoint) will be compared."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Apixaban","Warfarin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":77814,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Warfarin cohort (Reference)","description":"Patients with NVAF treated with warfarin","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]},{"label":"Apixaban cohort","description":"Patients with NVAF treated with apixaban","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin","description":"This is observational study and the patients in the warfarin cohort include those who are exposed to warfarin in the real world settings.","armGroupLabels":["Warfarin cohort (Reference)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"This is observational study and the patients in the apixaban cohort include those who are exposed to apixaban in the real world settings.","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban cohort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to incidence of a composite stroke and of systemic embolism","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February 2013 to 31 December 2021)"},{"measure":"Time to Incidence of Systemic Embolism","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"},{"measure":"Time to incidence of major bleeding","description":"Major bleeding is defined as any bleeding requiring hospitalization.","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to Incidence of Cardiogenic Cerebral Embolism","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"},{"measure":"Time to Incidence of Cerebral Infarction","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"},{"measure":"Time to Incidence of Intracranial Hemorrhage","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"},{"measure":"Time to Incidence of Gastrointestinal Bleeding","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"},{"measure":"Time to Incidence of Intraocular Bleeding","timeFrame":"Maximum of ８ years (From 26 February, 2013 to 31 December, 2021)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study.\n\n  1.
