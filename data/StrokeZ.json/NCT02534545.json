In addition, all participants receive an usual clinical therapy.","detailedDescription":"In this study, Patients in the RLIC group will be treated with Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (200mmHg) once daily for 12 months; patients in the sham RLIC group will be treated with the Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (60mmHg) once daily for 12 months. In the study, the RLIC treatment will be comprised of 5 cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia and reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation. Sham RLIC treatment will be conducted using the same procedure but with a minimal inflation pressure of 60mmHg, which does not result in upper limb ischemia. In addition, all participants will have received their usual drug therapy according to local medical practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis","ischemia","remote ischemic conditioning","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Doctormate® (200mmHg)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be treated with Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (200mmHg) once daily for 12 months","interventionNames":["Device: Doctormate® (200mmHg)"]},{"label":"Doctormate® (60mmHg)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will be treated with the Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (60mmHg) once daily for 12 months","interventionNames":["Device: Doctormate® (60mmHg)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Doctormate® (200mmHg)","description":"Limb ischemia was induced by Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) inflating tourniquets to 200mmHg.","armGroupLabels":["Doctormate® (200mmHg)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Doctormate® (60mmHg)","description":"Limb ischemia was induced by Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) inflating tourniquets to 60mmHg.","armGroupLabels":["Doctormate® (60mmHg)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The time from randomization to the first occurrence of fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke.","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The time from randomization to the first occurrence of a composite of fatal or non-fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and transient ischemic attack (TIA) .","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."},{"measure":"The time from randomization to the first occurrence of each component of the composite of fatal or non-fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and TIA.","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Time to death from all causes from randomization.","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Scores assessed by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Scores assessed by modified Rankin Scale(mRS)","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Scores assessed by Barthel Index(BI).","timeFrame":"During the first 12 months from randomization."},{"measure":"Number of participants with abnormal laboratory values","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Number of participants with adverse events that are related to treatment","timeFrame":"3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
