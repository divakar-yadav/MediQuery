This will be randomized clinical triall study. Data will be collected from Lahore General Hospital by using non-probability convenient sampling technique. Patients will be divided into two groups, (Group A and Group B). Group A will include patients that will be treated with joint integrity exercises of upper limb by applying tactile stimulation, kinaesthetic stimulation and stereognosis. and Group B will include those patients which will be treated with mirror therapy of upper limb. Session will be 3 days per week. Data will be collected pre (baseline=0 week) and post intervention (after 6 weeks) from two groups using Nottingham sensory assessment, Fugl Mayer Assessment and Motor assessment scale. SPSS for windows software, version 25 will be used to analyze the data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Joint integrity ,Proprioception, Mirror therapy, Hemineglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Joint integrity exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tactile stimulation with the various textures will be applied to the patients with three strokes followed by 3 sec rest period.\n\nKinaesthetic stimulations will be given to the patients to increase proprioception proprioception in neglected limb in sitting position, the limb on the affected side of the body is supported and moved by the examiner in various directions but movement is only at one joint at a time.

It is used for assessment of motor function of upper extremity. The FMUE Scale comprises 33 items, each item scored on 3 point ordinal scale of 0 to 2, where 0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially and 2 = performs fully. Total score for motor function is 66.

It is used for sensory examination of tactile sensation, kinesthesia and stereognosis. Tactile scoring is 0-2, where 0 = absent, 1 = impaired and 2 = normal. Stereognosis scoring is 0-2, where 0 = absent, 1 = impaired and 2 = normal. Kinesthesia scoring 0-3, where 0 = absent, 1 = appreciation of movement taking place, 2 = direction of movement sense and 3 = joint position sense.\n\nReading will be at Baseline and after 4 weeks","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Motor assessment scale","description":"This scale is designed to assess the return of function following a stroke or other neurological impairment. The test looks at a patient's ability to move with low tone or in a synergistic pattern and finally move actively out of that pattern into normal movement. It consists of 9 sections. The higher the score, the higher functioning the patient has on the affected side.
