Secondary objectives: 1) To investigate the correlation of gut microbiota and its serological indicators with imaging features and clinical neurological deficits in ICH; 2) Dynamically observe the changes of human microbiome and its serological indicators after ICH, and explore the biomarkers based on human microbiome related to disease changes.","detailedDescription":"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage has brought a heavy burden to society and families. Finding biomarkers closely related to the condition of intracerebral hemorrhage is an important research direction for the prevention and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, there are few studies on the correlation between cerebral hemorrhage and microbiota. Our previous small sample study found that there were intestinal flora and SCFAs metabolism disorders in patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage, and the latter was significantly related to poor prognosis. These results suggest that gut microbiota and its metabolites may become prognostic predictors and therapeutic targets for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. However, more research evidence is still needed to confirm. Therefore, this study hypothesized that oral or intestinal flora in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage has a certain degree of disorder and dynamic changes, accompanied by changes in serum markers, and there is a potential relationship between the changes of some microbiota-related markers and the severity and outcome of cerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, this topic proposed collection in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage oral swabs, blood and feces or anal swab specimens, evaluate the neurological function score, imaging features and clinical outcomes, and to establish a follow-up queue, the dynamic change of cerebral hemorrhage patients after intestinal bacterial flora and condition and poor prognosis, the correlation of biomarkers new prediction and prevention of brain hemorrhage, To improve the effectiveness of prevention and treatment of cerebral hemorrhage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke","Acute","Outcomes","Metabolites","Gut Microbiota"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood, stool, oral swabs"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute cerebral hemorrhage","description":"intestinal flora disturbance To observe the clinical prognosis of acute cerebral hemorrhage after enterobacterial disorder","interventionNames":["Other: intestinal flora disturbance"]},{"label":"The group without stroke","description":"The group without stroke"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"intestinal flora disturbance","description":"To observe the clinical prognosis of acute cerebral hemorrhage after enterobacterial disorder","armGroupLabels":["Acute cerebral hemorrhage"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological function score (mRS score)","description":"Neurological function score (mRS score)","timeFrame":"3 months after onset"},{"measure":"mortality","description":"mortality","timeFrame":"within 12 months after onset"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"New cerebrovascular events","description":"Occurrence of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"within 12 months after onset"},{"measure":"NIHSS","description":"NIHSS","timeFrame":"The first day and the seventh day after admission, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after onset"},{"measure":"Barthel Index","description":"BI","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months and 12 months after onset"},{"measure":"Mini-mental State Examination","description":"MMSE","timeFrame":"The first day and the seventh day after admission, 3 months and 6 months after onset"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment","description":"MOCA","timeFrame":"The first day and the seventh day after admission、3 months and 6 months after onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
