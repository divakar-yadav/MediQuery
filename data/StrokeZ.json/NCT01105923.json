The investigators will randomize the clinics that will receive the intervention and formally evaluate the study after a period of 6 months for improved problem list completeness to determine the effectiveness of our intervention.","detailedDescription":"The clinical problem list is a cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. Problem lists are used in a variety of ways throughout the process of clinical care. In addition to its use by clinicians, the problem list is also critical for decision support and quality measurement.\n\nPatients with gaps in their problem list face significant risks. For example, if a hypothetical patient has diabetes properly documented, his clinician would receive appropriate alerts and reminders to guide care. Additionally, the patient might be included in special care management programs and the quality of care provided to him would be measured and tracked. Without diabetes on his problem list, he might receive none of these benefits.\n\nIn this study, the investigators developed an clinical decision support intervention that will identify patients with problem lists gaps. The investigators will alert providers of these likely gaps and offer providers the opportunity to correct them."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity","Asthma","COPD","Breast Cancer","Coronary Artery Disease","Congestive Heart Failure","Diabetes","Glaucoma","Hemophilia","Hypertension","Hyperthyroidism","Hypothyroidism","Myasthenia Gravis","Osteoporosis","Osteopenia","Renal Failure","Renal Insufficiency","Sickle Cell Disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Receive CDS intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Providers in clinics that will receive the CDS alert, as their clinic was randomized into our study.","interventionNames":["Other: MAPLE"]},{"label":"No CDS intervention","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"MAPLE","description":"MAPLE is a CDS intervention within the EHR that will alert providers to problem lists gaps and present an opportunity to correct them.","armGroupLabels":["Receive CDS intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intervention acceptance","description":"Of those providers who were shown (or who would have been shown, for the control group) the intervention, the number that added a problem across control and intervention groups.","timeFrame":"6 months (May 2010-Nov2010)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Problem list prevalence","description":"Number of patients with selected problems on their problem list pre and post intervention across intervention and control groups.","timeFrame":"pre and post intervention"},{"measure":"Problem list incidence","description":"For the conditions of interest, the percent of patients that had the problem added during the study period","timeFrame":"pre and post intervention"},{"measure":"Quality improvement based on problem list accuracy/completion","description":"For those with problems added due to the intervention, the number of new triggered reminders or other clinical actions.","timeFrame":"post intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Independent healthcare provider (physician, NP, PA)\n* Practices at participating site\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Adam Wright, PhD","affiliation":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02115","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"22215056","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wright A, Pang J, Feblowitz JC, Maloney FL, Wilcox AR, McLoughlin KS, Ramelson H, Schneider L, Bates DW.
