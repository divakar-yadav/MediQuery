There is also evidence that OSA predicts worse outcome after stroke. The question being addressed in the Stroke and CPAP Outcome Study 3 (SCOUTS3) is how to improve use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy to treat OSA when started during intensive stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"In an initial single-arm study, participants with stroke will be tested for OSA and treated with auto-titrating CPAP during inpatient stroke rehabilitation and continued for a 3-month treatment period. Multiple behavioral interventions will be used to improve CPAP use, including intensive CPAP technical support, motivational enhancement therapy, and phone and mobile health automated support. The multicomponent behavioral intervention will be optimized to improve CPAP adherence with the engagement and input of stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Intra Cerebral Hemorrhage","Obstructive Sleep Apnea","Adherence, Treatment","Motivation"],"keywords":["behavioral therapy","continuous positive airway pressure","rehabilitation therapy","stroke recovery","self determination"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SCOUTS3 Optimization Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In a single-arm study, participants from acute ischemic stroke or intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the past 30 days will be tested for OSA with a single-night portable OSA test during inpatient rehabilitation (IPR). Eligible participants will then be started on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and exposed to a multicomponent CPAP adherence intervention, beginning during IPR and extending for 3 months. Participants' CPAP use will be monitored, and input regarding the intervention will be sought from the participants, CPAP partners, and the research team implementing the intervention. Data from an initial group of study participants will be reviewed in meetings with the study team and a patient advisory board, and adaptations will be devised and then implemented within the next batch of study participants. Through this iterative process that includes input from important stakeholders, the behavioral intervention will be adapted for use among stroke patients.","interventionNames":["Device: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)","Behavioral: CPAP technical support intervention","Behavioral: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)","Behavioral: Mobile Health intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)","description":"Eligible participants with a diagnosis of OSA will be set up with autotitrating CPAP by the study's sleep technologist.
