Multiple communication strategies can be employed during the MI, including open-ended questions, affirmative statements, reflective listening, use of a 'confidence ruler', and summarizing. The 'confidence ruler' technique in this patient population involves asking the patient \"On a scale of zero to ten, how confident are you that you can stop using tobacco?\", and then requesting further information about why they selected a certain number. These communication strategies and techniques are designed to uncover and foster a patient's own internal motivations to change the target behavior.","armGroupLabels":["Motivational Interview"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Smoking cessation at 90-day post-discharge follow up","description":"Yes or no","timeFrame":"90 days post-discharge"},{"measure":"Patient rating of ability to improve their health","description":"Patient answers question \"I am confident that I can work together with my care team to improve my health\" with a rating from 1 (do not agree at all) to 10 (completely agree)","timeFrame":"90 days post-discharge"},{"measure":"Recurrence of stroke / TIA symptoms","description":"Yes or no","timeFrame":"90 days post-discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient ability to take stroke prevention medications as prescribed","description":"Yes or no","timeFrame":"90 days post-discharge"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient presentation consistent with a stroke or TIA\n* Patient is a current tobacco user and tobacco use contributed to the stroke\n* Resident enrolled in study assigned to Vascular Neurology service during patient admission.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient unable or unwilling to follow up in the outpatient stroke clinic after discharge\n* Patient has cognitive impairment or aphasia that would preclude meaningful participation in motivational interview (defined as a score of 0 on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale \\[NIHSS\\] questions 1 and 9)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"99 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Julie Segura","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(352) 733-2412","email":"Julie.segura@neurology.ufl.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Heather Panic, MD PhD","affiliation":"University of Florida","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Christine Wilson, MD","affiliation":"University of Florida","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Florida","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Gainesville","state":"Florida","zip":"32608","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Heather Panic, MD PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":29.65163,"lon":-82.32483}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
