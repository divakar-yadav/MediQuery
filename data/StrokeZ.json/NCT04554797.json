The safety of selective brain cooling in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, however, is not established in a randomized trial. The investigators therefore conducted this RCT study to further explore the safety of regional hypothermia in patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Neuroprotection","Hypothermia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Regional Hypothermia group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Regional Hypothermia"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Regional Hypothermia","description":"Regional hypothermia was achieved by intraarteral perfusion of cold fluid into the ischemic area of the brain","armGroupLabels":["Regional Hypothermia group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of any major adverse events","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of intracerebral hemorrhage","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Rate of death","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"NIHSS","description":"Scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits.","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Final infarct volume","description":"measured on 5-7 days CT (or MRI if available)","timeFrame":"5-7 days"},{"measure":"NIHSS","description":"Scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits.","timeFrame":"7 days or discharge"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale","description":"The modified Rankin scale is a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).
