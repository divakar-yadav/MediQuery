Serious games are a promising solution in the rehabilitation of cognitive impairments, and they may be useful in the rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect. Investigators developed a rehabilitation program for visual exploration training with a serious game and investigated its efficiency. Twelve patients with unilateral spatial neglect after a right hemispheric stroke were recruited. Six patients assigned to a group received both serious game training and conventional rehabilitation, and after only conventional rehabilitation; and six patients assigned to another group received first conventional rehabilitation and then serious game training and conventional rehabilitation. The investigators compared the two groups after rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Unilateral Spatial Neglect"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","new technology","unilateral spatial neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Each patient was assigned to a group who received 2 rehabilitations for 3 weeks, 1) both serious game training and a conventional rehabilitation first and then conventional rehabilitation alone (group 1, G1), or 2) a conventional rehabilitation first and then both serious game training and a conventional rehabilitation (group 2, G2).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Each patient received 2 rehabilitations : a serious game training and a conventional rehabilitation first (during 3 weeks) and then conventional rehabilitation alone (during 3 weeks)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: serious game rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Each patient received 2 rehabilitations for 3 weeks: a conventional rehabilitation first (during 3 weeks) and then both serious game training and a conventional rehabilitation (during 3 weeks)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: serious game rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"serious game rehabilitation","description":"The SG rehabilitation was proposed to be played four times per week for three weeks, for a total of 12 sessions, with 15 min per session (= 60 minutes per week).
