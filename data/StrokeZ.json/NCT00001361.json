MRI is especially useful when studying the brain, because it can provide information about certain brain functions. In addition, MRI is much better than standard X-rays at showing areas of the brain close to the skull and detecting changes in the brain associated with neurological diseases. In this study researchers will use MRI to gather information about the processes that control human movement and sensory processing.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to investigate how the brain is activated when remembering, thinking, or recognizing objects. Researchers would like to determine what happens to brain functions when patients have trouble remembering, thinking, or recognizing objects following the start of disorders in the brain and nervous system. In addition, this study will investigate the processes of motor control in healthy volunteers and patients with disease.","detailedDescription":"The main purpose of the studies presented in this protocol is to investigate the physiology of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place during disease. Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during different tasks, either while making repetitive movements or undergoing sensory stimulation. These studies should provide new insight concerning the processes that control human movement and sensory processing. The studies described in this protocol will be conducted by systems operating on 1.5 Tesla up to 4 Tesla, including a system at 3 Tesla which is going to be installed in near future."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorder","Healthy","Movement Disorder","Nervous System Disease","Spinal Cord Injury"],"keywords":["Movement Disorders","Sensory Processing","Stroke","Spinal Cord Injury","Blood Flow","Blood Volume","Cognitive Function","Neurobehavioral Deficits","Neurological Disorders","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Plasticity","Normal Volunteer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":610}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Patients with movement disorder and normal volunteers.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)","city":"Bethesda","state":"Maryland","zip":"20892","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.98067,"lon":-77.10026}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"9236723","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Sadato N, Ibanez V, Campbell G, Deiber MP, Le Bihan D, Hallett M.
