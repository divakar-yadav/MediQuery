In addition another aim is to examine the effects of these exercises on the swallowing function, quality of life, functional independence and functional oral intake of individuals, and to investigate the superiority of the exercises to each other in line with these features."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia","Swallowing Disorder"],"keywords":["Dysphagia","Stroke","PNF Exercise","CTAR Exercise","Swallowing Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The physicians who will evaluate imaging methods will not know which arm they are in.

Patients will be asked to do the exercise protocol, which consists of isometric and isotonic components.","armGroupLabels":["CTAR Exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS)","description":"The penetration aspiration scale (PAS) is routinely used to assess penetration and aspiration severity during videofluoroscopic or FEES assessment. It has a scoring system from 0 to 8, depending on whether it is aspirated or penetrated after administration of liquid-consistent and solid foods with oral contrast agent or dye. High scores indicate the presence of aspiration and penetration.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Ultrasound Evaluation","description":"Neck submental muscle cross-sectional thickness measurement (millimeter-mm), sternocleidomastoideus muscle thickness measurement (mm), hyoid bone elevation measurement (millimeter-mm) and tongue base cross-sectional area (square-centimeter-cm2) will be measured by USG before and after therapy. USG measurements will be made by an experienced radiologist. Three measurements will be taken from each muscle group and the results will be averaged to minimize variations in muscle thickness.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cognitive Status","description":"Mini Mental Test will be used to evaluate the cognitive status of individuals. It is a short, useful, standardized test that provides the opportunity to evaluate cognitive performance in a short time. A high score indicates a good cognitive status. The maximum possible score is 30. A score of 17 and below is considered severe dementia, a score of 18-23 is considered mild dementia, and a score of 24-30 is considered normal.","timeFrame":"a day before the start of treatment"},{"measure":"The Barthel Index","description":"The Barthel index evaluates physical independence in activities of daily living in 10 items (transfer, ambulation/wheelchair use, stair climbing, feeding, dressing, self-regulation, bathing, toilet use, urinary continence, stool continence). Each item is scored separately as 0, 5, 10 or 15 points. A total score of 0-20 means fully dependent, 21-61 highly dependent, 62-90 moderately dependent, 91-99 mildly dependent and 100 fully independent.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)","description":"It is an easy-to-apply scale consisting of ten items, which allows the rapid assessment of dysphagia symptoms in patients with swallowing disorders. It contains ten questions about oropharyngeal dysphagia, each question is scored between 0 and 3. The total score is obtained by summing the scores. High scores indicate severe dysphagia.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS)","description":"Oral nutritional status of individuals will be evaluated by using The FOIS is a seven-item scale. It is used to show the level of an individual's feeding tube and oral intake. High scores indicate normal oral intake.

SWAL-QOL includes 10 concepts: general load, food choice, eating time, desire to eat, fear of eating, sleep, fatigue, communication, mental health, and social function. A high score indicates good quality of life. Since its creation, the SWAL-QOL questionnaire has been used as the gold standard in the assessment of quality of life in studies on swallowing disorders.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years and older,\n* Who have been diagnosed with stroke\n* At least one month has passed since the diagnosis of stroke\n* Voluntarily participated in the research,\n* Cooperative, able to take instructions (Mini Mental Test score of 24 and above) and\n* Individuals with a score of 2 or higher on the Penetration Aspiration Scale will be included.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Lack of long-term sitting balance, unable to maintain an upright position with or without support,\n* Have tumors or neoplastic disease in the head and neck region,\n* Radiotherapy applied to the neck, swallowing disorders caused by radiotherapy applied to the head and neck region,\n* With additional musculoskeletal disease that may cause swallowing disorders,\n* With non-stroke neurological disease (Traumatic Brain Injury, Parkinson's, Dementia, ALS, MS, etc.),\n* Individuals who have previously received dysphagia treatment will be excluded from the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Esra Nur ÖZCAN, MSc","affiliation":"Karamanoğlu Mehmetbey University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Nezehat Özgül ÜNLÜER, PhD","affiliation":"Ankara Yildirim Beyazıt University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Selcuk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Otolaryngology","city":"Konya","state":"Selcuklu","zip":"42131","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":37.87135,"lon":32.48464}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003680","term":"Deglutition Disorders"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000004935","term":"Esophageal Diseases"},{"id":"D000005767","term":"Gastrointestinal Diseases"},{"id":"D000004066","term":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"id":"D000010608","term":"Pharyngeal Diseases"},{"id":"D000010038","term":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6572","name":"Deglutition Disorders","asFound":"Swallowing Disorder","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7775","name":"Esophageal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8573","name":"Gastrointestinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6945","name":"Digestive System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13205","name":"Pharyngeal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12651","name":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC09","name":"Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
