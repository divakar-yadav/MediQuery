Since thrombi in stroke patients are rich in VWF, NAC could be used as a thrombolytic agent during the acute phase. This study aims at assessing the safety of NAC in combination with alteplase (rt-PA) at the acute phase of ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Thrombolysis","Hemorrhagic transformation","Alteplase","Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"N-Acetylcysteine 150 mg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single intravenous injection of N-Acetylcysteine (150 mg/kg in 15 minutes).","interventionNames":["Drug: N-Acetyl cysteine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"N-Acetyl cysteine","description":"Administered as specified in the treatment arm","armGroupLabels":["N-Acetylcysteine 150 mg/kg"],"otherNames":["HIDONAC"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhagic transformation","description":"Rate of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation according to the SITS-MOST criteria: a local or remote parenchymal hemorrhage on imaging 22 to 36 hours after treatment or earlier if the imaging scan was performed due to clinical deterioration combined with a neurological deterioration of \\>4 NIHSS points from baseline or from the lowest NIHSS score between baseline and 24 hours or leading to death within 24 hours.","timeFrame":"22 to 36 hours after treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Extracranial hemorrhagic events","description":"Rate of extracranial hemorrhagic events","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Treatment related side effects","description":"Rate of any drug related side effects according to the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Event 5.0.","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Mortality and functional independence","description":"Rate of mortality and functional independence at 3 months according to the modified Rankin scale (mRs)","timeFrame":"3 months after treatment"},{"measure":"Early neurological improvement","description":"Rate of early neurological improvement defined as an improvement of \\>4 NIHSS points 24 hours after treatment.","timeFrame":"24 hours after treatment"},{"measure":"Plasma VWF multimers","description":"Mean size of VWF multimers before and after treatment","timeFrame":"Before, at 3 hours and at 24 hours after treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient presenting with an acute ischemic stroke (non lacunar) as assessed by cerebral imaging (either CT or MRI), with or without visible vessel occlusion.\n* Patient eligible to intravenous thrombolysis according to current criteria, including patients who will also benefit from endovascular treatment (if eligible).\n* Personal or familial consent to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known hypersensitivity to N-Acetylcysteine or to any excipient from the formulation.\n* Coma and/or NIHSS \\<4 or ≥20.\n* Daily treatment with Nitrovasodilator before the inclusion.\n* Known asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring bronchodilatators or steroids.\n* Participation to another interventional study if it requires administration of an experimental treatment in the first 3 days after NAC treatment.\n* Women of childbearing age (age \\< or = to 50)\n* Known history of prior treatment with vitamin-K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant.\n* Known history of severe hepatopathy including cirrhosis, portal hypertension (esophageal varices) and evolutive hepatopathy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"86 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Marion Boulanger, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33231064617","email":"boulanger-ma@chu-caen.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Caen","city":"Caen","state":"Normandy","zip":"14000","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Marion Boulanger, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33231064617","email":"boulanger-ma@chu-caen.fr"},{"name":"Emmanuel TOUZE, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33231064617","email":"touze-e@chu-caen.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":49.18585,"lon":-0.35912}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28487393","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Martinez de Lizarrondo S, Gakuba C, Herbig BA, Repesse Y, Ali C, Denis CV, Lenting PJ, Touze E, Diamond SL, Vivien D, Gauberti M.
