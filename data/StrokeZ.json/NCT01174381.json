Experiences gained over many years in the developed countries can be of great value in planning and implementing NCD prevention and control activities in the developing countries Results from many studies have emphasized the fact that merely providing risk reduction measures for clinically high-risk people in health service settings would have only a limited impact in the whole country. On the other hand, if the population as a whole were to be targeted, even a modest risk factor and healthy lifestyle change would potentially have a huge public impact.This study attempts to implement a lifestyle intervention programme aimed at changing the dietary habits, physical activity and alcohol and tobacco consumption in the 25-60year old adults in the MOH area, Ragama and measure the effectiveness of the programme. Outcome measures are process indicators, as measured by change in the dietary patterns, alcohol and tobacco consumption and physical activity. Short term outcome indicators would be blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. The long term outcome indicators such as morbidity and mortality due to NCD will not be measured as this will be a short term study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Hypertension","Stroke","Ischemic Heart Disease"],"keywords":["Non communicable disease","Lifestyle Modification","Community Based organization","community based study"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":440,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lifestyle modification","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Lifestyle modification for behavior change related to NCD prevention","interventionNames":["Behavioral: lifestyle modification"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"lifestyle modification","description":"Lifestyle modification for six months","armGroupLabels":["Lifestyle modification"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of participants who change their lifestyle characteristics related to NCDs","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of participants with decrease in Body Mass Index following lifestyle modification programme","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* adults between 25-60 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* adults with psychiatric disorders","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thushani M Dabrera, MBBS, MSc","affiliation":"University of Kelaniya","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Kelaniya","city":"Ragama","state":"Western","zip":"0094","country":"Sri Lanka","geoPoint":{"lat":7.0292,"lon":79.917}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"},{"id":"D000073296","term":"Noncommunicable Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6805","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Ischemic Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","asFound":"Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M1156","name":"Noncommunicable Diseases","asFound":"Non-communicable Diseases","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
