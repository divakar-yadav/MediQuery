With the changes in people's diet, lifestyle patterns and population aging, the incidence of acute cerebral infarction has increased year by year, which has become an important cause of disability and death in middle-aged and elderly patients. The human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK) was used in China in the management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in recent years. However, the mechanism of HUK on AIS has not been systematically investigated. This study aimed to assess the effect of HUK on motor functional outcome and relative corticospinal tract recovery in the patients with AIS. Diffusion tensor imaging(DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography(DTT) have all been used to observe features of cerebral white matter fibrous structures. In addition, diffusion tensor tractography which is used to trace fiber bundle and evaluate white matter fiber bundle integrity and direction is the only non-invasive imaging method to display the corticospinal tract in vivo.","detailedDescription":"A total of 80 AIS patients with the unilateral corticospinal tract damage who were matched for inclusion criterion were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. The HUK group was administered with HUK and standard treatment(general treatment for anti-platelet, lipid-lowering and improving circulation,etc.), the control group received only standard treatment. Kallikrein+Standard Treatment Group (general Treatment for anti-platelet, lipid-lowering and improving circulation,etc.) and Standard Treatment Group were randomly selected.\n\nAt admission and discharge, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS), Barthel Index(BI), muscle strength were scored; The DTI were performed and DTT were utilized to reconstruct corticospinal tract to observe its direction and appearance changes then to evaluate the integrity and impairment degree of the corticospinal tract which was divided into four grades according to DTT presented compression, deformation, or rupture. Fractional anisotropy(FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) of infarct region and corresponding contralateral normal regions were measured.\n\nBlood samples were collected to test serum myelin basic protein(MBP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The primary endpoint is the short-term motor function prognosis of the AIS patients, we also evaluated the recovery of corticospinal tract and the serum MBP and VEGF changes during treatment in two groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Kallikrein+Standard treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Kallikrein+Standard treatment group was given kallikrein through intravenous injection to treatment for 0.15 PNA/day+standard treatment medicine based on the guidelines for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke for 14 ± 5 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Kallikrein"]},{"label":"Standard treatment group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The Standard treatment group was only given standard treatment medicine based on the guidelines for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke for 14 ± 5 days."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Kallikrein","description":"HUK has been approved by China's State Food and Drug Administration as a state category I new drug for the treatment of stroke patients.
