This is due to heavier priorities placed on other stroke competencies such as mobility, activities of daily living training and home integration which results in suboptimal amounts of time spent in upper limb training post stroke.\n\nIn this study the investigators plan to pilot brain computer interface (BCI) integrated wearable hand robotic glove (HandyRehab) system for upper limb stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Robot-aided therapy have shown promising results in rehabilitation recovery in stroke patients while reducing strain and effort for both the therapist and suitable patients.\n\nHandyRehab (HR) is a portable, wearable hand robotic glove used for functional training. The integration of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) platform with HR provides an alternative way of communication or intended movement through end-effectors for stroke and potentially facilitate neuroplasticity, improving motor functions.\n\nThis study aims to validate the usability of intensive training with HandyRehab (HR) compared with conventional occupational therapy (CT). Feasibility and safety of the novel BCI-HR will be examined and objective measures of clinical efficacy will be compared across all 3 platforms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Brain Computer Interface","Hand exoskeleton robot"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study design is a prospective, single-centre, single blinded 3-arm randomised controlled trial to compare upper extremity motor and functional outcomes and health related quality of life (HR-QOL) of 3 treatment modalities which are fully clinic-based and supervised by trained occupational therapists (OT).
