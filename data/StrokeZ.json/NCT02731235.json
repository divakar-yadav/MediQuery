The patients have few and temporary symptoms and are therefore early discharged from the hospital. After an cerebral infarct the patients have increased risk of recurrent stroke and they are at risk of developing cognitive deficits or vascular dementia over time. Researchers want to investigate if high-intensity training at home in the acute phase has an effect on aerobic fitness, endothelial response and health profile in this potential fragile group of patients. We hope to increase the patientsÂ´ physical and mental function, and thereby prevent a recurrent stroke and slow the progression of vascular diseases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Lacunar"],"keywords":["Stroke","stroke, acute","Cerebral small vessel disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":71,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"OTHER","description":"Prophylactic stroke medication and recommendations for lifestyle changes","interventionNames":["Drug: prophylactic stroke medication","Behavioral: Recommendations for lifestyle changes"]},{"label":"Exercise","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Prophylactic stroke medication and recommendations for lifestyle changes AND high-intensity training at home, 5 days a week in 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: High-intensity training","Drug: prophylactic stroke medication","Behavioral: Recommendations for lifestyle changes"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"High-intensity training","description":"high intensity training 5 days a week for 12 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Exercise"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"prophylactic stroke medication","description":"Usual care medication for stroke prophylaxis","armGroupLabels":["Control","Exercise"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Recommendations for lifestyle changes","description":"Advise on diet, alcohol, smoking and exercise","armGroupLabels":["Control","Exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Difference in the 'Graded Cycling Test with Talk Test'","description":"Sub-maximal exercise test on a stationary bicycle","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Endothelial response","description":"measurement of endothelial response by Endopat2000","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"Physical Activity Scale (PAS)","description":"A questionnaire that measures the level of self-reported physical activity","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"Short time activity measurements","description":"Accelerometer (Axivity) to short time registration of physical activity (24 hours in an 8 day period (after inclusion, before 3 months visit, before 12 month visit)","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"The WHO-five Well-being Index (WHO-5)","description":"A questionnaire that measures current mental well-being","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","description":"A cognitive screening test for detection of mild cognitive impairments","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"Major Depression Inventory (MDI)","description":"A self-report mood questionnaire","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)","description":"A 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue.","timeFrame":"at baseline, 3 (primary analysis), 6 and 12 months after baseline testing"},{"measure":"Ull-Meter","description":"An instrument which measures the individual stress reaction -
