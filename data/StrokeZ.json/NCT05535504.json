Each group will receive 10 sessions of the real rTMS or sham rTMS over the contralesional primary motor cortex. Each rTMS session consists of low-frequency (1Hz) 1800 stimulations.\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rTMS for upper-limb motor function in patients with subcortical and brainstem stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Subcortical Infarction"],"keywords":["Stroke","Transcranial magnetic
