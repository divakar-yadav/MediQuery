Currently there are numerous therapeutic procedures aimed at rehabilitation that have scientific evidence such as restrictive therapy. However, dysfunction of the upper limb has an impact on the whole body that is not always taken into consideration.","detailedDescription":"The intervention of the stimulation of the reflex locomotion is carried out in this study in a sitting position in a conventional chair, an unorthodox posture in the usual treatment of Vojta therapy.\n\nDescription of the sitting posture: the back in axial extension with the shoulders located in front of the hips.\n\nThe elbows must be supported with the medial epicondyl in contact on a table, whose height is at the level of the end of the patient's sternum.\n\nThe forearms are placed prone with the palms facing the surface. In this position we place a rubber sphere 3 centimeters in diameter under the pisiform of one of the patient's wrists.\n\nThe reflex stimulation is performed by the passive pressure exerted by the weight of the wrist (pisiform) on the rubber sphere. Simultaneously the patient has to exert a slight pressure with the heel towards the ground with his foot. This foot will be the opposite of the wrist that has the sphere under the pisiform.\n\nIt is a cross-stimulation, that is, pisiform in one hand together with the load in the heel of the opposite side.\n\nAlternating each diagonal 4 times, 5 minutes each. Total session 20 minutes, 2 times per day, every day according to degree of affectation\n\nThe duration of the study will depend on the degree of involvement: mild 2 weeks, moderate 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurological Disorder"],"keywords":["stroke","Physical therapy","neurological hand","Vojta therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Pretest-posttest trial","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Adult patients with chronic sequelae in the upper limb after neurological damage","interventionNames":["Other: Reflex locomoction therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Reflex locomoction therapy","description":"The intervention of the stimulation of the reflex locomotion is carried out in this study in a sitting position in a conventional chair, an unorthodox posture in the usual treatment of Vojta therapy.\n\nThe reflex stimulation is performed by the passive pressure exerted by the weight of the wrist (pisiform) on the rubber sphere.
