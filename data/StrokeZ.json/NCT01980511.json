We will determine the incidence of acute covert stroke using an MRI study of the brain in the days following noncardiac surgery. We will characterize the epidemiology and the impact of covert stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, and its association with cerebral deoxygenation.","detailedDescription":"At the University of Wisconsin a planned sub study of NeuroVISION is being conducted aiming to enroll 100 patients with additional cognitive testing, MRI sequences and a preoperative MRI scan.\n\nAt Hamilton Juravinski Hospital, Hamilton General Hospital, Auckland City Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital a planned sub study of NeuroVISION (PAFS - Perioperative Atrial Fibrillation and Postoperative Stroke) is being conducted aiming to enroll 400 participants. The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the prevalence of AF(Atrial Fibrillation) before surgery (i.e. \"background\" AF), as well of the incidence of AF after surgery using the Icentia CardioSTAT \"patch-like\" single lead heart rhythm monitor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Covert Postoperative Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1116,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction","description":"Our primary objective is to characterize the impact of postoperative covert stroke on neurocognitive function 1 year after elective noncardiac surgery, as measured by a decrease of two or more points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale from preoperative baseline test to the 1-year follow-up.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of acute postoperative covert stroke","description":"We will detect acute postoperative covert stroke using an MR study of the brain that will be performed between postoperative days 2 and 9.","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Clinical 30-day outcomes (rated yes/no)","description":"Overt stroke, transient ischemic attack, death, myocardial infarction, myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, nonfatal cardiac arrest, major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiac revascularization procedures, bleeding, new atrial fibrillation, hypotension, congestive heart failure, new acute renal failure, infection and sepsis","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Clinical 1-year outcomes (rated yes/no)","description":"Overt stroke, transient ischemic attack, death, myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, major adverse cardiovascular events (composite), congestive heart failure, new acute renal failure, dementia and mild cognitive impairment","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Postoperative delirium","description":"Delirium will be measured using the Cognitive Assessment Method (CAM).","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Physical function after surgery as assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale","description":"Physical function will be measured using the Modified Rankin Scale.
