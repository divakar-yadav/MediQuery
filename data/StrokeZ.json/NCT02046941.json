Specifically, the investigators will use voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to identify lesion sites most predictive of a positive response to speech treatment and advanced diffusion imaging techniques to map changes in the integrity of white matter tracts from pre- to post-treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["aphasia","stroke","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Speech Production Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This treatment employs a response-contingent hierarchy made up of verbal modeling/repetition, graphic cueing, integral stimulation, and articulatory placement instruction.

The change in percent correct list repetition from pre-intervention (5 probe trials) to the end of intervention (final 3 probe trials) was calculated as individual treatment effect sizes using the Busk \\& Serlin (1992) d2 statistic, which involves subtracting the difference between mean performance at end of the intervention minus pre-intervention, divided by the pooled standard deviation of the two phases.
