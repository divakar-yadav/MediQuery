Its role as a cause of cerebrovascular events in the older population is more controversial because of other competing causes are more frequent in the elderly. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that PFO closure is associated with a 59% relative risk reduction in the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. As such, the number of PFO closure procedures are expected to increase substantially in the upcoming years. Real world data (RWD) informing on the medical management, the risk of stroke recurrence, incident atrial fibrillation, and other outcomes in stroke patients with PFO, with and without PFO closure, will become crucial for understanding how results from RCTs are translated into clinical practice globally.\n\nThe IMPROVE (International Multicenter Patent foRamen OVale \\& strokE) Registry is an observational, multicenter, international registry of men and women with an ischemic stroke or TIA. The aim is to enroll 8,800 patient-years at ≥50 sites in ≥20 countries.\n\nThe IMPROVE Registry will provide important information about the management and related outcomes of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and PFO throughout different regions of the world and across a wide spectrum of healthcare systems."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Patent Foramen Ovale","Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Flutter"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3730,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sex","description":"Female and male patients","interventionNames":["Device: PFO closure"]},{"label":"Age >60 years of age","description":"Patients younger or oder than 6o years of age","interventionNames":["Device: PFO closure"]},{"label":"World region","description":"Patients from different world regions: North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America","interventionNames":["Device: PFO closure"]},{"label":"Stroke vs. TIA","description":"Index event: stroke vs. TIA","interventionNames":["Device: PFO closure"]},{"label":"Neurocardiology Teams","description":"Patients assessed by a neurocardiology team","interventionNames":["Device: PFO closure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"PFO closure","description":"PFO closure after stroke or transient ischemic attack","armGroupLabels":["Age >60 years of age","Neurocardiology Teams","Sex","Stroke vs. TIA","World region"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent stroke","description":"Recurrent hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up (minimum of 3 months)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incident atrial fibrillation","description":"New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after the index date","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up (minimum of 3 months)"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients undergoing PFO closure","description":"Proportion of patients undergoing PFO closure","timeFrame":"Within 12 months of the index diagnosis of PFO after the stroke or transient ischemic attack"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent stroke or death","description":"Recurrent hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, or death","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up (minimum of 3 months)"},{"measure":"Recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction","description":"Recurrent hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up (minimum of 3 months)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"INCLUSION CRITERIA (all of the following criteria should be fulfilled)\n\n* Age ≥18 years\n* Ischemic stroke or TIA within 5 years and 1 year before inclusion in the registry.
