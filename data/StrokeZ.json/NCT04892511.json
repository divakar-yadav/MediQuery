However, less than half of the patients achieve functional independence despite treatment. The optimization of blood pressure after mechanical thrombectomy based on the degree of recanalization achieved at the end of the procedure could improve the perfusion of the ischemic brain tissue thanks to the improvement of blood circulation provided by collateral circulation. For this, authorized hypotensive or hypertensive drugs will be used. Moreover, this individualized treatment would allow to decrease reperfusion injury and therefore decrease the risk of intracerebral bleeding complications and cerebral edema. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial in which the standard management of blood pressure after mechanical thrombectomy will be compared with a specific protocol in which blood pressure targets are applied according to the degree of recanalization obtained during the thrombectomy procedure. The beneficial effect and risk reduction of this treatment will translate into a better short and long-term outcome"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":814,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard treatment","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Post-thrombectomy patients will have their blood pressure measured every hour for the first 24 hours after thrombectomy, and every 6 hours from 24 to 72 hours.
