How to better evaluate and improve post-stroke motor and cognitive dysfunction has always been a hot research topic. With the rapid development of brain-computer interface technology, rehabilitation assessment based on quantitative EEG analysis is gradually being applied in the medical field. So we designed a brain-computer interface based on hierarchical task induction-pedaling rehabilitation training system to investigate the effectiveness on the rehabilitation of stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rehabilitation","Stroke","Brain-computer Interface"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Brain-computer Interface-Pedaling Training System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Brain-computer Interface-Pedaling Training System"]},{"label":"Traditional Pedaling Training System","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients wear the same EEG equipment that only collect data, but not guide training.","interventionNames":["Device: Traditional Pedaling Training System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Brain-computer Interface-Pedaling Training System","description":"The Brain-computer Interface-Pedaling Training System includes four parts: computer, monitor, EEG testing equipment and pedaling training equipment.
