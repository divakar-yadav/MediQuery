It has been established that bacteria in the gut play key roles in digestion, nutrition absorption and immune response of the entire body. Human intestinal bacteria composition in the gut has been associated with several stroke risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and hypertension. If we can establish a relationship between gastrointestinal microbial community composition and ischemic stroke outcomes could lead to dietary interventions in the future to improve recovery after a stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Fecal and blood samples will be collected.
