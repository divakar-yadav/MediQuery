Ischemic Conditioning (IC) is a non-invasive, simple procedure that improves motor function, exercise performance and cardiovascular function in healthy controls, but it has never been applied to the stroke population. We postulate that IC enhances the recruitment of motoneurons and results in positive neural adaptations, improves vascular endothelial function and peripheral blood flow, and together these improvements result in an increased capacity to exercise and faster walking speed. Future studies will examine the effects of IC and traditional therapy at different time points of recovery post stroke, durability of IC, molecular mechanisms of neural and cardiovascular adaptation and the efficacy compared with other adjuncts.","detailedDescription":"This study will quantify the effects of Ischemic Conditioning and treadmill training on improvements in: walking speed, leg strength, neuromuscular fatigability and the hyperemic blood flow response to muscle contractions, and vascular endothelial function and aerobic exercise capacity. A randomized control design will be used with three groups of chronic stroke survivors enrolled for four weeks of training (3x/week; 12 sessions total). The groups are: IC + Treadmill Training, IC Sham + Treadmill Training, and IC only. We will also enroll a group of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects who will undergo IC + Treadmill Training. All Aims will be tested concurrently over a five-year period. All studies will be performed in Cramer Hall at Marquette University in the Integrated Neural Engineering Rehabilitation Laboratories, the Human Performance Assessment Core, and the Physical Therapy Clinic.\n\nRandomization of stroke patients to the three intervention groups will be performed by using randomized block designs (randomly chosen block sizes of 3, 6 and 9). This number accounts for possible dropouts and the use of non- parametric methods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke, Cardiovascular"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Ischemic Conditioning","Treadmill Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Conditioning + Treadmill Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study participants with prior history of stroke will receive both ischemic conditioning and treadmill training.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Ischemic Conditioning","Procedure: Treadmill Training"]},{"label":"Ischemic Conditioning Sham + Treadmill Training","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Study participants with prior history of stroke will receive both ischemic conditioning sham and treadmill training.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Ischemic Conditioning Sham","Procedure: Treadmill Training"]},{"label":"Ischemic Conditioning Only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Study participants with prior history of stroke will receive only ischemic conditioning.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Ischemic Conditioning"]},{"label":"Healthy Control - Ischemic Conditioning + Treadmill Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Healthy control participants will receive both ischemic conditioning and treadmill training.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Ischemic Conditioning","Procedure: Treadmill Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Ischemic Conditioning","description":"Ischemic conditioning is a well-defined, non-invasive procedure which consists of inflating a blood pressure cuff around a limb (in our study, the paretic leg), inflating the cuff to 225 mmHg to occlude blood flow to the limb for 5 minutes, releasing the cuff for 5 minutes, and repeating 5 times.
