The effectiveness of this management has been demonstrated since recurrence stroke risk is reduced by 80% at one year. An English study (EXPRESS study) \\[2\\] showed a gain of 624 pounds with an ambulatory management compared to a conventional one. No studies are available in France on this subject.\n\nThe aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a collection of medical and economic data on a prospective way. The investigators collect medical (Cerebrovascular events, Stroke) and economic (direct and indirect costs) data concerning patients who were managed in TIA clinic in Toulouse Hospital. The medical data will be compiled with available French and International literature. The economic data will be compiled with available data in PMSI and health insurance database. This study aims to prepare a multicenter cohort to compare the cost effectiveness ratio between ambulatory and conventional management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["minor stroke","cost-effectiveness","feasibility","day clinic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The average cost-effectiveness ratio at 3 month","description":"The average cost-effectiveness ratio at 3 month where the effectiveness is the 3-month cerebro vascular event rate and the costs taken into account are medical and non-medical direct costs and indirect costs limited to work stoppages.","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of full cost collection","description":"Percentage of patients for whom total direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs could be collected by comparing with health insurance data","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Concordance between monitoring data collected in different database","description":"Concordance between prospectively collected monitoring data, supplemented by data from the PMSI database of Toulouse University Hospital and data extracted from the health insurance database via NIR.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Recurrence rate of cerebro and cardiovascular events at 7 days","description":"Recurrence rate of cerebro and cardiovascular events at 7 days : Stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death within 30 days of stroke or MI","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Recurrence rate of cerebro and cardiovascular events at 3 months","description":"Recurrence rate of cerebro and cardiovascular events at 3 months : Stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death within 30 days of stroke or MI","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Recurrence rate of cerebro and cardiovascular events at one year","description":"Recurrence rate of cerebro and cardiovascular events at one year : Stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death within 30 days of stroke or MI","timeFrame":"one year"},{"measure":"Average cost-effectiveness ratio at one year","description":"The average cost -
