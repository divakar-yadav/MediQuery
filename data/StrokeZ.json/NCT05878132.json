We hypothesize that using a multimodal feedback system in the wearable device can provide more effective training to improve the hemiplegic UL function of chronic stroke survivors than conventional therapy.\n\nThis is a single-blinded randomized crossover pilot trial. Twelve participants will be randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental (wristwatch) and the control (conventional therapy) groups. Participants in the experimental group will undergo a 4-week wearable device treatment followed by a 4-week conventional training.\n\nParticipants in the control group will complete conventional therapy and then wearable device treatment. There will be a 3-week washout period between treatments. Upper limb motor outcome measures will be evaluated at the following intervals: baseline, post-treatment at 4-week, after a 3-week washout period for pre-intervention, and post-intervention after crossover by research assistants blinded to group allocation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","telerehabilitation","Wearable device","Upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Single-blinded randomized crossover trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Randomization was stratified based on the participant's baseline upper limb severity according to the FTHUE-HK.
