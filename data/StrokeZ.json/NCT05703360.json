Can the 6-week IVR stimulation program help improve driving performance?\n2. Will participants experience improvement in visual detection and perception after training?\n\nStudy Design Summary:\n\n* Participants will be randomized into a waitlist group or intervention-first group\n* The VR-based intervention will consist of training every 2 days for six weeks\n* Waitlist group will wait 6 weeks before starting intervention at study midpoint (week 7)\n* Intervention-first group will begin with intervention (week 1-6) and then stop intervention at study midpoint\n* Participants will complete tests related to driving performance, visual attention, and visual fields at the start of study, midpoint, and end of study\n\nResearchers will analyze data for changes from baseline in outcome measures.","detailedDescription":"This clinical trial will be an interventional, cross-over, single blind, randomized, supportive care, single-center study lasting 12 weeks with a target recruitment of 30 participants.\n\nSCREENING AND BASELINE TESTS\n\nPotential participants will be identified from patients receiving routine care at Toronto Western Hospital by their ophthalmologist. After obtaining informed consent and screened for inclusion, the research coordinator will set up appointments for each participant to complete baseline tests related to driving performance, visual attention, and visual fields. Participants will also practice the IVR program and be assessed for IVR sensitivity, or cybersickness, using the Virtual-Reality Induced Symptoms and Effects (VRISE) questionnaire.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into a Waitlist group or Intervention-First group. The Intervention-First group will be given a head-mounted display (HMD) to take home for training.\n\nINTERVENTION (Week 1 - 12)\n\nPeriod 1 (Week 1-6):\n\n* Waitlist Group has no intervention\n* Intervention-First group trains at home every 2 days using HMD\n\nAll participants are booked for their second appointments to repeat baseline tests once Period 1 is complete. Intervention-first group will return their HMD to the researchers and Waitlist group will be given their HMD to take home.\n\nPeriod 2 (Week 7-12)\n\n* Waitlist Group trains at home every 2 days using HMD\n* Intervention-First group has no intervention\n\nAll participants are booked for their third appointments to repeat baseline tests once Period 2 is complete. Waitlist group will return their HMD to researchers.\n\nPOST-INTERVENTION\n\nAnalysis of outcome measures:\n\n1. Period 1 (Waitlist Group vs Intervention-First Group)\n2.

Then all 8 spheres move for 20 seconds following random linear paths, bouncing on one another and on the walls of a virtual 3D cube when collisions occur. After 20 seconds, the movement stops and the participant is asked to select, using the hand controller, the initially highlighted target(s) among the 8 spheres. If the selection is correct the speed of the spheres in the next trial is increased.
