Patients simultaneously performed a program of therapeutic exercises 3 days a week. Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale, which assessed upper limb motor function, and the Barthel index, which assessed general functional disability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Transcranial Laser Therapy","Hemiplegia","Rehabilitation","Physiotherapy","Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial low level laser therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Transcranial laser therapy is applied by automatic scanning over both hemispheres and the patients undergoing also a standard rehabilitation program based on therapeutic exercises.","interventionNames":["Procedure: low level laser therapy procedure"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The patients undergoing only a standard rehabilitation program based on therapeutic exercises.","interventionNames":["Procedure: low level laser therapy procedure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"low level laser therapy procedure","description":"Transcranial low level laser therapy by automatic scanning noncontact over both cerebral hemispheres.","armGroupLabels":["Control","Transcranial low level laser therapy"],"otherNames":["COMBY 3 Terza Serie C-LASER; ASA."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Scale","description":"The upper extremity Fugl-Meyer subscale (0-66) considers flexor and extensor synegies as well as reflex activity and coordination and is specific for grading motor impairments.","timeFrame":"20 minutes"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"Barthel index (0-100) is composed of 10 items and assesses activities related to clothing,nourishment,personal hygiene and transference.","timeFrame":"10 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
