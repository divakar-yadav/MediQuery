The subjects will be instructed to listen to 3 minutes, which can facilitate the recovering process for scope of attention and thought-action repertoire. Thus, to see the improvement in stroke performance.","detailedDescription":"The intervention of this study is music, specifically, instruct subjects to listen inducing positive emotion music due to positive emotion benefit to cognition performance.\n\nThe condition of mental fatigue will be induced by Stroop task. Before the intervention or process of listening music, the pre-test will be recorded to compare the post-test value of table tennis stroke performance.\n\nMoreover, the different music intervention will be implemented to identify the optimal selection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mental Fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Positive emotion music fatigue group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After mental fatigue inducement, participants will be instructed listening to music pieces for inducing positive emotion music.","interventionNames":["Other: Inducing positive emotion music"]},{"label":"Fatigue control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"After mental fatigue inducement, participants will be instructed to sit and relax for the same duration as intervention group.","interventionNames":["Other: Inducing positive emotion music"]},{"label":"No Fatigue positive emotion music group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"participants will not be induced mental fatigue, but will be instructed listening to music pieces for inducing positive emotion music.","interventionNames":["Other: Inducing positive emotion music"]},{"label":"No fatigue control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"participants will not be induced mental fatigue.

This form consists of nine items, which are: Amusement, Anger, Anxiety, Contentment, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, and Serenity, rated on a 9-point Likert scale. Participants report that higher scores represent a stronger current emotional state. A higher score for positive emotion items indicate a higher level of positive emotion was induced. The emotional state will be measured in baseline(before inducing mental fatigue); before and after the music intervention to observe any differences.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Scope of attention","description":"Scope of attention will be measured by Global-local Processing Task, total 8 sets of stimulation. In each stimulation, participants will be instructed to select one figure (base on global configuration aspect or the local elements),which is more similar compare the the Standard figure. The more selection based on the global configuration by participants, means the more breadth of attention. Scope of attention will be measured in baseline(before inducing mental fatigue); before and after the music intervention to observe any differences.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Thought-action repertoire","description":"Thought-action repertoire will be measured by Twenty Statement Test. Participants will be encouraged to fill the twenty blanks with:\"i would like to \" as many as possible, the more blanks filled by participants, the more score will be reported. the higher scores mean the more breadth of thought-action repertoire.
