Patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5-72h after onset were prospectively enrolled in our study and underwent standardized clinical and new imaging technique package assessment.\n2. New imaging technique package mainly includes conventional cranial MRI （T1,T2,T2 FLAIR,DWI, and ADC), cranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and intracranial vessel wall imaging (High-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging,HRMRI) as well as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).\n3. The neurofunctional fluctuation during hospitalization as well as 90-day outcomes were carefully assessed. Patients were followed up for 90-days after stroke onset.\n4. Our study aims to explore the value of new imaging technique package in predicting early neurological deterioration (END) as well as 90-day unfavorable outcome in patients with acute ischaemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Intracranial Arteriosclerosis","Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases"],"keywords":["AIS","ICAS","CSVD"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":949,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"early neurological deterioration within 3 weeks after stroke onset (END-3 weeks)","description":"END-3 weeks is defined as a significant neuro-functional decline \\[increment of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥ 2 points \\] within 3 weeks after admission.","timeFrame":"3 weeks after stroke onset"},{"measure":"90-days prognosis","description":"90-days prognosis included two parts :1) stroke recurrence with new lesion on DWI;2) the modified Ranking Score (mRS) at 90-days after stroke onset.","timeFrame":"90-days after stroke onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. patients with ischemic stroke and hospitalized during 4.5-72 hours after onset , confirmed by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI).\n2. patients with stable vital signs.\n3. patients who have underwent thrombolytic/intravascular therapy are allowed to enroll in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. patients with absolute/relative contraindication to MRI (including but not confined to metal in the body and claustrophobia).\n2. patients who is extremely agitated, and cannot comply with MRI exam.\n3. patients who declined the consent.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients will be recruited from the collaborative stroke centers and will be followed for the duration of their hospitalization.
