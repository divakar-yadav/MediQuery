In a study examining the effects of motor imagery, which produces effects similar to physical movement, on muscle oxygenation, no change in muscle oxygenation was detected with motor imagery. However, no study has been found examining muscle oxygenation along with motor imagery in stroke patients. However, it has not been investigated whether there is a difference in muscle oxygenation between the affected and less affected extremities after stroke. For this reason, our study was planned to examine the effect of motor imagery on lower extremity muscle oxygenation in stroke patients. In addition, in our study, we will examine whether there is a difference in muscle oxygenation between the affected and less affected extremities in stroke patients under different conditions (rest / physical movement / motor imagery (mental movement)). Since there are insufficient studies in this field in the literature, we think that our study will lead to future studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["motor imagery","Muscle oxygenation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke group","description":"assessment of effect motor imagery on muscle oxygenation","interventionNames":["Other: assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"assessment","description":"assessment of motor imagery on muscle oxygenation","armGroupLabels":["stroke group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"muscle oxygenation","description":"Muscle oxygenation measurement with Moxy muscle oxygen monitor via quadriceps femoris muscle in both affected and less affected extremities","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire","description":"It is a tool used to evaluate the imagination levels of healthy and physically disabled individuals. There are a total of 20 items in the survey, 10 visual and 10 kinesthetic. With the questionnaire, the intensity level of imagery is recorded on a 5-point Likert scale. A high score is considered an indication of a good level of visualization.","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Movement imagery questionnaire 3","description":"The survey consists of 12 items. With the questionnaire, the intensity level of imagery is recorded on a 7-point Likert scale.

A stopwatch will be kept at the beginning of the visualization and the stopwatch will be stopped when the individual says that he/she has finished visualizing the test. The physically realized time will be compared with the imagined time. It will be used with the Timed Up and Go Test.","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go Test","description":"This test evaluates the dynamic balance of individuals during functional mobility; It includes components such as standing, walking and turning. Individuals are asked to stand up from the chair they are sitting on without support, and after walking a distance of 3 meters, they are asked to return from the designated area and sit on the chair again without support. At the end of the test, the time calculated with a stopwatch is noted in seconds.","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Five Times Sit to Stand Test","description":"The individual was asked to stand up and sit down five times without holding on to the chair, and the time taken was recorded. This method, which is valid and reliable in stroke patients, has been shown to be related to lower extremity muscle strength and balance. Low times are indicative of high performance.","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being between the ages of 40-75\n* Being diagnosed with stroke\n* BMI \\<30kg/cm2\n* Subcutaneous fat thickness \\<12mm\n* Mini Mental State Test Score being 24 or above\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having another musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic or neurological disease that is serious enough to prevent participation in the study\n* Having serious vision and hearing problems\n* Presence of serious cognitive impairment determined by the physician that would prevent the tests from being performed\n* Presence of an open wound or infection in the area to be measured","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Individuals between the ages of 40-75 who are diagnosed with stroke and meet the inclusion criteria who volunteer to participate in the research constitute the sample of the study.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
