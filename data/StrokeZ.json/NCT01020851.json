Statin treatment and lifestyle modification is also recommended for post-stroke and post-TIA patients with elevated cholesterol levels or a history of stroke or TIA with an atherosclerotic cause. Despite the clear benefits of secondary stroke prevention, there is a gap between evidence and implementation in clinical practice. By a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will test whether a tailored, telephone-delivered transtheoretical model-based behavioral intervention will improve adherence to treatment in veterans with a history of TIA or stroke, thereby leading to better control of BP and cholesterol levels, as compared to an attention placebo.\n\nThe primary specific aims of this project are to:\n\n* determine whether a behaviorally tailored intervention (TI) can effectively lower BP after 6 months of counseling as compared to an attention placebo (AP) in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA\n* assess whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to diet after 6 months of counseling in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA.\n\nSecondary aims are to\n\n* assess whether the TI is effective in improving cholesterol levels in post-stroke veterans after 6 months\n* evaluate whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications after 6 months of counseling in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA\n* determine whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to exercise recommendations after 6 months.\n\nTo answer this, veterans (n=190) with a history of stroke or TIA will be randomized equally to the TI, which will use the transtheoretical framework to provide 6 monthly counseling phone sessions about adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations, and the AP, in which 6 monthly counseling phone sessions about non-stroke-related health topics will be provided. Participants will make in-person visits at baseline and 6 months. BP (3 measures taken at least 5 min apart) and dietary sodium are the primary outcomes, while secondary outcomes will be total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio, adherence to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and exercise adherence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["hypertension","stroke","cholesterol","adherence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":202,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tailored intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm will receive 6 monthly telephone calls of a behaviorally tailored intervention based on the transtheoretical model.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: tailored intervention"]},{"label":"attention placebo","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this arm will receive 6 monthly telephone delivered counseling sessions about general health topics","interventionNames":["Behavioral: attention placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"tailored intervention","description":"6 monthly telephone calls focusing on diet, medication and exercise adherence using the framework of the transtheoretical model","armGroupLabels":["tailored intervention"],"otherNames":["stage-matched intervention","transtheoretical model"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"attention placebo","description":"6 monthly telephone-delivered sessions focusing on general health topics","armGroupLabels":["attention placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"blood pressure","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"cholesterol","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"dietary adherence","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"exercise adherence","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"medication adherence","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Well-documented history of stroke or TIA\n* Age 21 years or older\n* Continuity of care in the primary care or neurology clinics, defined as at least 1 visit in either clinic during the past 1 year\n* On hypertensive and/or lipid-lowering agents\n* A score of \\>16 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam-\n* Ability to exercise (assessed by time to get up and go).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Limited life expectancy due to a severe non-CVD related comorbid terminal illness such as cancer\n* No telephone number at which patient can be reached\n* Plans to relocate within the next 6 months\n* Inability to communicate over the telephone due to severe cognitive impairment or aphasia","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, NY and Brooklyn Campuses","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10010","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14540","name":"Recurrence","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
