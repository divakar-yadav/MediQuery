The main objective of volume expansion is to increase and maximize stroke volume. Hemodynamic changes have an impact on the autonomic nervous system. The analysis of heart rate variability allows an exploration of the autonomic nervous system and could therefore provide information on the effect of volume expansion. The Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) is an analgesia monitor based on the concept of heart rate variability. By deviating from its original use, the investigators wish to evaluate the ability of ANI to identify a response to volume expansion.","detailedDescription":"Perioperative optimization is based on volume maximization using volume expansion. The main objective of volume expansion is to increase stroke volume. The Franck-Starling curve is schematically divided into two portions: a vertical portion which mean that an increase in preload secondary to volume expansion will induce an increase in stroke volume; and a flat portion where volume expansion will not induce an increase in stroke volume. Perioperative optimization is based on stroke volume maximization using volume expansion.\n\nIn case of hypovolemia, there is a compensatory sympathetic stimulation with parasympathetic withdrawal. Volume expansion will lead to an increase in venous return and therefore in cardiac output, which will result in a decrease in sympathetic tone. The autonomic nervous system is therefore directly affected by these load changes. The analysis of heart rate variability, which has been studied for several years in various setting, allows the assessment of autonomic nervous system, through monitoring of the electrocardiogram. Experimental and clinical studies report the ability of variations in heart rate variability to detect a situation of hypovolemia. In anaesthesia, heart rate variability is used to evaluate the nociception-antinociception balance. Indeed, any nociceptive stimulation leads to an increase in sympathetic tone. MetroDoloris has developed a non-invasive monitor that provides an index, the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), to evaluate the nociception-antinociception balance by analysing the autonomic nervous system.\n\nIn this study, the original use of ANI will be diverted from its initial use, to analyse the autonomic nervous system's response to volume expansion. Thus, the aim of the present study is to determine whether a change in Analgesia Nociception Index can track the stroke volume effects of a volume expansion using 250ml of crystalloid in the operating room.\n\nThe follow up will be restricted to the duration of surgical intervention. The last data will be collected 5 minutes after the end of volume expansion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Volume Expansion","Fluid Responsiveness"],"keywords":["volume expansion","fluid responsiveness","stroke volume","perioperative optimization","analgesia nociception index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI)","description":"ANI will be used to analyse the autonomic nervous system's response to volume expansion.\n\nANI will be assessed during surgery, before during and after the volume expansion"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ANI value variation (%) before and after the volume expansion","description":"Changes in the analgesia nociception index during a volume expansion of 250 mL crystalloid during 10 minutes in patients who responded to volume expansion (stroke volume increase by 10% or more after volume expansion) and in patients who did not respond to volume expansion (stroke volume increase less than 10% after volume expansion).","timeFrame":"5 minutes after volume expansion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient older than 18 years\n* patient scheduled for neurosurgery in prone position\n* patient equipped from an arterial catheter and stroke volume monitoring\n* Patient for whom volume expansion is needed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* emergency surgery,\n* cardiac dysfunction,\n* arrythmia,\n* beta-blockade therapy,\n* pacemaker,\n* intracranial hypertension,\n* pregnancy,\n* dysautonomia","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient scheduled for neurosurgery","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de Bordeaux","city":"Bordeaux","zip":"33076","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":44.84044,"lon":-0.5805}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
