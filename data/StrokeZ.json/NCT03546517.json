Thus, this avoids patients having to travel elsewhere for the study. Furthermore, in the case of patients who wish to participate in the study after having received information via third persons or via other means and who are not members of the Association or do not attend the centre on a regular basis, the Association AIDA has offered to allow these people to attend for free, making its facilities available and supporting the development of this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity"],"keywords":["myofascial trigger point","dry needling","spasticity","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Patients and assessor are blinded but the physiotherapist giving the treatment is not blinded","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention with DNHS technique","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dry needling of biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachialis, extensor digitorum and adductor pollicis","interventionNames":["Other: Dry Needling"]},{"label":"Sham Dry Needling","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham Dry needling of biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachialis, extensor digitorum and adductor pollicis","interventionNames":["Other: Sham Dry Needling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Dry Needling","description":"Dry needling of biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachialis, extensor digitorum and adductor pollicis","armGroupLabels":["Intervention with DNHS technique"],"otherNames":["DNHS technique"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham Dry Needling","description":"Sham Dry needling of biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachialis, extensor digitorum and adductor pollicis","armGroupLabels":["Sham Dry Needling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Scale","description":"Scale measuring Upper Limb Function in stroke patients. The motor and sensory assessments are scored on a three-point ordinal scale (0 -2) in which a higher score indicates superior results. The motor assessment measures voluntary limb movement and includes a subscale for the Upper Extremity (33 items; score range, 0-66). The sensory assessment measures limb sensation. Sensation is assessed as absent, impaired, or normal for light touch (two items each for Upper Extremity (UE) and Lower Extremity (LE); score range, 0-8) and proprioception (four items each for UE and LE; score range, 0-16) for a total sensory Fugl-Meyer (FM) score of 24. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) has shown to have an excellent intra and interrater reliability (0.89-0.99).

Part I of the scale consists of 5 single-item dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has a 3 point response scale, ranging from worst imaginable health state to best imaginable health state. Scoring/Interpretation: Descriptive data from the 5 dimensions of Part I can be used to generate a health-related quality of life profile for the subject.

All patients must have a good cognitive level in order to ensure that they are able to communicate with the professionals involved in the study in order to understand the exercises and thus fulfil the objectives for participation.\n* Presence of spasticity ≥1 according to the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS) score during the flexion-extension movement of the wrist and elbow in at least one of the muscles of the upper limb evaluated.\n* Age: between 30 - 90 years. In this range of age CVA's are more common, according to data from the Spanish Statistical Office.\n* Evolution: over 6 months must have passed since the CVA episode. Most of the studies reviewed involve patients who are in the chronic stage of illness. This will ensure that the changes found are due to our intervention and not related to plasticity mechanisms occurring after the injury (this will be considered objectively by performing an assessment at baseline, which will be repeated 1 week later, immediately before and after the dry needling intervention).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Concomitance of degenerative illnesses which can alter the results.\n* Presence of fixed contractures: 4 according to the MMAS score\n* Suffering from epileptic fits that are not medically controlled.\n* Fear of needles.\n* No tolerance to pain caused by needling.\n* Those unable to commit to attendance.\n* Patients who have received treatment with Botulinum Toxin (BTX A) in the 6 months prior to their inclusion in this study, or those who received said medication or another during the study with the aim of decreasing spasticity.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Universidad San Jorge","city":"Zaragoza","zip":"50830","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":41.65606,"lon":-0.87734}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34894776","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Calvo S, Brandin-de la Cruz N, Jimenez-Sanchez C, Bravo-Esteban E, Herrero P.
