Despite significant limitations between studies of PSD risk factors, stroke severity or post-stroke disability, prior depressive episodes, and female sex are arguably the most well-known risk factors for developing PSD, although the predictive value of these factors is limited.\n\nA hypoechogenic brainstem raphe (BR) detected by transcranial sonography (TCS) is associated with depressive symptoms in distinct diseases but is also common with approximately 25% of the non-depressed population in Europe. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the association between BR hypoechogenicity and PSD occurrence in a prospective observational study design."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Serum blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BRH+","description":"Acute ischemic stroke patients with brainstem raphe hypoechogenicity.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Transcranial sonography."]},{"label":"BRH-","description":"Acute ischemic stroke patients without brainstem raphe hypoechogenicity.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Transcranial sonography."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transcranial sonography.","description":"Transcranial sonography examination to determine the brainstem raphe echogenicity.","armGroupLabels":["BRH+","BRH-"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Post-stroke depression","description":"PSD diagnosis was defined according to the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V criteria) or by any new medication for anti-depressive indication during follow-up","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Severity of depressive symptoms","description":"Measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD, minimum score: 0, maximum score: 52), with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke with the onset of symptoms within the past 14 days\n* Diagnosis of AIS is confirmed by brain imaging, either computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Insufficient transtemporal bone window for transcranial sonography examination","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients who present with an acute ischemic stroke to the emergency department with the onset of symptoms within the past 14 days.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Daniel Richter, Dr,","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00492345090","email":"daniel.richter-c34@rub.de"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Christos Krogias, Prof.","affiliation":"St. Josef-Hospital Bochum, Ruhr-University Bochum","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"St. Josef-Hospital Bochum","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Bochum","state":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","zip":"44791","country":"Germany","contacts":[{"name":"Daniel Richter, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00492345090","email":"daniel.richter-c34@rub.de"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.48165,"lon":7.21648}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6748","name":"Depression","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6751","name":"Depressive Disorder","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Acute Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
