Post-stroke infections, in general, are associated with less favorable neurologic outcomes. Aspiration is one of the most feared complications of enteral nutrition and can lead to the occurrence of pneumonia. Severe stroke patients are at high risk for aspiration due to some factors such as the reduced level of consciousness, inability to protect the airway and so on. The purpose of this study is to explore the ideal nutrition support strategy for patient with acute severe stroke to help reduce the incidence of PSP and improve the prognosis.","detailedDescription":"As one of the most common complication of stroke, some studies showed that post-stroke pneumonia (PSP) in stroke patients requiring intensive care is associated with an increase of ICU length of stay and hospital mortality and poorer functional outcomes in survivors. The peak period of PSP is within the first week after stroke. Aspiration and poor nutritional status are important factors leading to pneumonia in stroke patients. Compared with full enteral nutrition (EN), initial trophic enteral feeding was associated with less gastrointestinal intolerance and could reduce the rate of regurgitation. However, trophic enteral feeding could not meet the daily caloric needs and hypocaloric enteral nutrition might be associated with increased mortality. This study is designed to explore whether initial trophic enteral nutrition combined with supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) can help reduce the incidence of PSP and improve the prognosis in severe patients with stroke.\n\nThis study will enroll 546 severe stroke patients who meet the inclusion criteria. Upon admission to the ICU, patients will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio into groups of full enteral feeding (controlled) and trophic enteral feeding combined with supplemental parenteral feeding (experimented) for 7 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Stroke","Acute Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["Severe Stroke","Acute Stroke","Dysphagia","supplemental parenteral nutrition","trophic feeding","pneumonia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":546,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Full enteral feeding","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive full enteral feeding through nasogastric tube or nasointestinal tube.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Full enteral feeding"]},{"label":"Trophic enteral feeding combined with supplemental parenteral nutrition","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive trophic enteral feeding combined with supplemental parenteral feeding.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Trophic enteral feeding combined with supplemental parenteral nutrition"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Trophic enteral feeding combined with supplemental parenteral nutrition","description":"The caloric goal of the first day is one-third of caloric requirements, the second day is half of caloric requirements, the third day is 70-100% and sustained for 1 week.
