What are the acute effect of UL-priming on lower limb neuroplasticity and motor behaviors in persons with stroke compared to other priming modalities?\n2. What are the time effects of UL-priming on neuroplasticity and motor behavior in individuals with stroke?\n\n   In this cross over study, participants will be involved in three priming sessions involving\n\n   - UL-priming using rhythmic, bilateral priming involving the movement of at least one major joint in the upper limbs.\n\n   AND\n\n   - Sham priming using auditory stimulation (1 Hz metronome).\n\n   AND\n\n   - Stimulation-based priming using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\n   OR\n\n   - Lower-limb movement-based priming using aerobic exercise on a treadmill or recumbent stepper.\n\n   Researchers will compare outcome measures between the different priming sessions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Upper
