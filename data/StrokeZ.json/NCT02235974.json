The investigators will perform a prospective exploratory study of upper extremity (UE) motor training delivered at higher than usual intensity at three different time points after stroke:\n\n* early (initiated within 30 days)\n* subacute/outpatient (initiated within 2-3 months)\n* chronic (initiated within 6-9 months)\n\nThe control group will not receive the therapy intervention during the 1-year study.\n\nOutcome measures will be assessed at baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6 months and one year after stroke onset.\n\nCompared to individuals randomized during the outpatient (2-3 months after stroke onset) or chronic (6-9 months after stroke onset) time points, participants randomized to early intensive motor training will show greater upper extremity motor improvement measured at one year post stroke.","detailedDescription":"Please see the following reference:\n\nDromerick, A.W., Edwardson, M., Edwards, D.F., Giannetti, M.L., Barth, J., Brady, K.P., Chan, E., Tan, M.T., Tamboli, I., Chia, R., Orquiza, M., Padilla, R.M., Cheema, A.K., Mapstone, M., Fiandaca, M.S., Federoff, H.J., \\& Newport, E.L.
