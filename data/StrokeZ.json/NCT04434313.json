A large percentage of stroke survivors, up to 70%, experience gait dysfunction, which can lead to reduced activity levels, limited community participation, and contribute to an increased risk of falls. Effective interventions to treat gait dysfunction are essential to reduce disability for these individuals.\n\nThe iStride™ gait device, initially designed to mimic the symmetry-improving mechanism of a split-belt treadmill, was developed to treat asymmetric gait impairments in stroke survivors. Unlike many currently available gait treatment devices, the iStride™ device is portable, therefore allowing gait treatment to occur overground and from the home environment. Training in natural environments is believed to enhance the transfer of learning as well as enable long-term training. Previously published studies with the iStride™ device demonstrate its ability to beneficially improve functional gait parameters, gait speed, and reduce fall risk in both clinical and home settings.\n\nTo monitor improvement in gait function, the device is paired with patented iStride sensors™. The combined system, the Moterum iStride Solution™, is currently being used by stroke survivors in the home environment. In the current delivery model, users are provided instruction and training from physical therapists in clinical settings before using the device in their home environment under the supervision of a Moterum staff member. User feedback has led to the exploration of novel methods to deliver device treatment remotely. \\[Additionally, the need for remote treatment has increased in urgency with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing guidelines.\\]\n\nIn this study, treatment with the iStride™ will be adapted to remote delivery using a telemedicine platform, the Moterum Digital Platform. A screening process will be implemented to guide participant selection and identify individuals likely to be successful with remote treatment delivery using the telemedicine modality. This process consists of an initial eligibility criteria review followed by a physical therapist video review of participant walking patterns.\n\nOnce enrolled in the clinical trial, participants will receive study-related equipment including the iStride™ device, Moterum iStride Hub and Sensors™, and a pre-measured strap for gait testing. They will be instructed in the download of the Moterum Digital Platform which will serve as the telemedicine modality for subsequent communication. Participants and their caregivers will be provided with instructional videos as well as therapist training on study procedures using video calls through the telemedicine platform. Instruction will include telemedicine portal navigation, iStride™ fitting (donning/doffing), mobility and walking guidelines with iStride™ device, assessment performance, environmental considerations, safety precautions, and caregiver guidelines and responsibilities.\n\nChanges to gait patterns will be assessed using specialized gait sensors and functional outcome measures before, during, and after the treatment. Caregivers will be trained in the performance of these outcome measures which can be overseen by physical therapists through video conferencing.\n\nFeasibility, compliance, and safety of the delivery method will be investigated throughout the trial using prompted questions within the Moterum Digital Platform and integrated forms to be completed by the participant and/or caregiver. After treatment is completed, participants and their caregivers will be surveyed to obtain feedback regarding usability, satisfaction, and sentiments regarding the remote delivery model."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Telemedicine","Gait, Hemiplegic","Gait Disorders, Neurologic","Stroke","Orthotic Devices","Gait Analysis"],"keywords":["iStride","Telehealth","Telerehabilitation","Gait Speed"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Delivery of iStride™ device gait treatment using telemedicine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment with the gait device will be adapted to remote delivery using the telemedicine platform.

This device does not require any external power and is completely passive; all necessary forces are redirected from the natural forces present during walking. This research aims to adapt the delivery mechanism of treatment with the iStride™ device to include telemedicine. The telemedicine platform of reference in this study, the Moterum Digital Platform, is an integrated therapeutic platform which offers an activity library, real-time video conferencing, and outcomes tracking. Our primary study objective is to determine if telemedicine is a safe and feasible delivery method for treatment with the iStride ™ gait device.","armGroupLabels":["Delivery of iStride™ device gait treatment using telemedicine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of safely implementing the treatment protocol","description":"The described delivery method includes using remote physical therapist treatment oversight and physical supervision of treatment activities by trained caregivers. Due to the inclusion criteria, patients already have some risk of falls and need for assistance while walking. The caregivers will record assistance levels provided during treatment. Any adverse events will be immediately reported and reviewed. The remote physical therapists will regularly review assistance levels to ensure the participant is requiring an appropriate level of assistance. The feasibility of safely delivering treatment will be assessed by two measures: (a) the daily safety rate, defined as the percentage of days an adverse event occurred out of the total number of treatment days, and (2) assistance required and adverse events experienced for each participant, compared to the group, and compared to our prior research.","timeFrame":"Determined at the end of the 12-session treatment period (approximately 4 weeks after beginning the treatment)."},{"measure":"Achievability of telemedicine delivery protocol","description":"The achievability of this treatment delivery method will be assessed by measuring participant compliance to the protocol tasks.
