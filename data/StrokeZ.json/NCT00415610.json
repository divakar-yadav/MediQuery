ICH--a form of stroke that has poor outcome and is difficult to treat--is associated with the highest mortality rate of all strokes. Hematoma expansion has been identified as the most common cause of neurological deterioration in persons with ICH. Early evidence suggests that acute hypertension (HTN)-or elevated blood pressure-may make some individuals more susceptible to hematoma expansion. Treating HTN acutely may prevent hematoma expansion, however, the effect of aggressive HTN treatment has not been determined.\n\nThe purpose of this trial is to evaluate the treatment feasibility and safety of lowering blood pressure using nicardipine--an antihypertensive medication--in persons who have acute HTN associated with ICH.\n\nThis pilot study will enroll 60 individuals who qualify with a presenting systolic blood pressure of at least 170 mmHg, have an ICH, and can be evaluated and treatment initiated within 6 hours of onset of stroke symptoms. In a stepwise fashion, the scientists will investigate the potential consequences of controlling blood pressure with intravenous nicardipine at 3 sequential levels: 170 to 200 mmHg, 140 to 170 mmHg, and 110 to 140 mmHg. Twenty participants will be enrolled per level.\n\nTreatment will last 18 to 24 hours. Participants will stay in the hospital for about 7 days (including 24 hours in the intensive care unit for close monitoring) and will return for 1-hour follow-up visits at 30 days and at 90 days after discharge from the hospital. During these visits participants will receive neurological assessments to determine their functional outcome. For participants, the study will be completed after the 90-day follow-up visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Hypertension","Stroke"],"keywords":["cerebral hemorrhage","intracerebral hemorrhage","stroke","hypertension","blood pressure","nicardipine","antihypertensive agent","hematoma expansion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Staged intensity levels of rapid intravenous antihypertensive control for elevated SBP in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were implemented in 3 sequential treatment arms to assess the feasibility and tolerability (safety) of this treatment.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Open treatment assignment was employed because it is not safe to conceal SBP measurement.
