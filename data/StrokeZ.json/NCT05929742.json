The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* The impact of virtual reality training on muscle strength;\n* The impact of virtual reality training on functional recovery;\n* The impact of virtual reality training on mood state.\n\nResearchers will compare the experimental group, which received early rehabilitation combined with VR training, and the comparison group, which received only early rehabilitation, to see if VR training has clinical benefits when provided alongside early rehabilitation during hospitalization.","detailedDescription":"Early rehabilitation has been shown to enhance outcomes for patients with first-time acute stroke. However, whether the addition of virtual reality (VR) training could further improve muscle strength, functional recovery, and mood state for these patients is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of early rehabilitation combined with VR training in patients following first-time acute stroke. Patients with acute ischemic stroke will be selected and randomly assigned with a 1:1 randomization ratio to either the experimental group or the comparison group. Both groups received early rehabilitation, and the experimental group received extra VR training starting 24 hours to 3 days poststroke during the stay in the hospital. Muscle strength, functional status, and mood state will be collected before and after the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Early rehabilitation","Virtual reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants were divided into two groups: the experimental group, which received early rehabilitation combined with VR training, and the comparison group, which received only early rehabilitation.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"received early rehabilitation combined with VR training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: virtual reality training","Behavioral: early rehabilitation"]},{"label":"comparison group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"received only early rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Behavioral: early rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"virtual reality training","description":"The experimental group received five additional days of supervised VR training using a wireless sensor in a private room in the neurological care ward.","armGroupLabels":["experimental group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"early rehabilitation","description":"Five 60-minute sessions per week, was prescribed by a rehabilitation physician and performed by physical, occupational, and speech therapists from 3 to 6 days after admission.","armGroupLabels":["comparison group","experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"muscle strength","description":"The testing involved assessing the patient's upper and lower limb/extremities muscles against the examiner's resistance and grading the patient's strength on a 0-5 scale, higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"through the admission period, an average of 1 month"},{"measure":"postural control","description":"The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS), consisting of two sections with a 4-point scale, with 0 being the lowest level of functionality and 3 the highest, and a total score ranging from 0-36, is a well-validated clinical assessment tool for postural control in patients with stroke during the first three months after stroke.","timeFrame":"through the admission period, an average of 1 month"},{"measure":"activities of daily living","description":"The Barthel scale used to assess individuals' performance in activities of daily living has high inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability as well as high correlations with other measures of physical disability.
