Theta burst stimulation (TBS) has achieved a similar effect to traditional rTMS mode.\n\nHowever, the current rTMS studies for stroke patients utilized the same therapeutic protocol and there is no individualized rTMS protocol based on the value of lateralization index.\n\nThis study aimed to aim to investigate the efficacy of individualized rTMS according to lateralization index on motor recovery and cortical excitability in subacute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"individualized rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive individualized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation according to lateralization index measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Traditional rTMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group is given traditional rTMS","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technology.
