Participants will be enrolled at the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar Es Salaam after confirmation of exclusion and inclusion criteria, including a head CT. Participants will be enrolled within 21 days of acute, ischemic stroke. The study will utilize a novel method for monitoring patient medication adherence: electronic pill bottles that can record medication use events. The primary goals of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of fluoxetine post-stroke to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger, phase III study in the future.\n\nVital status will be monitored throughout the study's enrollment period. At enrollment, participants will have cognitive tests administered, receive lumbar puncture, and receive an MRI brain. After discharge from the hospital, participants will be seen at 30-, 60-, and 90-days post-enrollment for an in-person study visit. At each time point, investigators will draw 10-15 mL of blood; download medication adherence data from participants' electronic pill bottles; and inquire about adverse events and evaluate patient disability through the modified Rankin Scale. If participants stop taking their daily pill, stroke specific reasons for non-adherence will be inquired including dysphagia, self-administration, and other concerns.\n\nPrimary assessments will be for safety and tolerability, as well as measurement of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale. Medication use data will also be collected through the electronic pill bottle, which will be returned to study investigators. As secondary assessments, the PHQ-9, and the Asberg Depressive Symptom Questionnaire will be administered. All 90-day assessments will be administered by senior site investigators, who will take a final 10-15mL blood draw to test for serum sodium and liver enzymes, possible adverse events related to long-term fluoxetine use, conduct a second MRI brain, evaluate participant mRS, and inquire about tolerability issues. Completion of the 90-day visit and associated assessments is considered the study endpoint."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Motor recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Phase II study of one dose","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"20mg dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fluoxetine 20 MG Oral Tablet","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoxetine 20 MG Oral Tablet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fluoxetine 20 MG Oral Tablet","description":"Once-daily dosing for 90 days","armGroupLabels":["20mg dose"],"otherNames":["Prozac 20 MG Oral Tablet"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serum Sodium Concentration","description":"Serum Sodium Concentration was measured in mmol/L.
