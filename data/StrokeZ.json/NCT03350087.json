Spasticity and loss of dexterity are the common problems in stroke. Recently, current interventions, such as cycling training, virtual reality (VR) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), were used for the treatment of upper extremity (UE) dysfunction in patients with stroke. However, few studies investigated the effects of the combinations of different treatment strategies using by integrating brain imaging and motor control studies. This project proposes different novel treatment strategies in the treatment of UE dysfunction in patients with stroke: combined inhibitory/facilitatory rTMS, VR-based cycling training (VCT), and combined rTMS and VCT. We hypothesize that the treatment effect of the combined protocol (optimal rTMS protocol and VCT) is more effective than single treatment due to integration of central and peripheral effects. Different treatment protocols will induce different changes in the brain reorganization and motor control, which further improve motor function, activity, participation, and health related quality of life (HRQOL).","detailedDescription":"This study aims to 1. identify the immediate effects of different treatment protocols in for UE training in these patients through brain image, motor control and clinical measures; 2. to determine the maintaining therapeutic effects; 3. to elucidate the most optimal treatment protocols; 4. to determine the neuro-motor control mechanism underlying clinical improvement; 5. to determine the clinimetric properties of the brain imaging and motor control measure that are responsive and valid for detecting changes after treatment protocol intervention, and 6. to identify clinical predictors influencing the outcome for treatment protocols.\n\nThe research will offer valuable motor control biomarkers for outcome prediction and targeting patients who benefit from new protocols. This project is significant for the translational and evidence-based medicine on stroke neurorehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Vascular Accident"],"keywords":["repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","stroke","optimal treatment protocol","VR-based cycling training (VCT)","randomized controlled trial","motor control","clinical predictors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"iTBS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS group), they received iTBS (80% of active motor threshold) on affected hemisphere.","interventionNames":["Device: intermittent theta burst stimulation"]},{"label":"cTBS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS group), they received cTBS (80% of active motor threshold) on unaffected hemisphere.","interventionNames":["Device: continuous theta burst stimulation"]},{"label":"iTBS+cTBS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS group) at first followed by intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS group).","interventionNames":["Device: iTBS+cTBS group"]},{"label":"sham TBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"In sham theta burst stimulation (sham TBS group), they received sham TBS stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: sham theta burst stimulation"]},{"label":"VCT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"VCT group received the VCT training in addition to traditional rehabilitation.
