Some clinical scales may play an important role in its diagnoses and treatments. Across the reviewed studies, the risk factors of END, which included biochemical parameters, neuroimaging, ect. were explored incompletely and the effective predictors of END is unknown. We aimed to explore the risk factors of END and investigate the predictive value of certain scales."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["deterioration","risk factors","predictors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"END group","description":"The patients in this group had an elevation of ≥ 2 points in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 7 days of stroke onset."},{"label":"non-END group","description":"The patients in this group had a slight increase of \\< 2 points or a decrease in NIHSS within 7 days of stroke onset."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale","description":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) can assess the severity of stroke.
