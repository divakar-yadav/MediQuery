The intervention itself, however, causes immediate risk of stroke or death, and it is also an issue whether the temporary reduction of blood flow associated with clamping of the artery, during the surgical intervention, may trigger long-lasting brain tissue dysfunction.\n\nMild hypothermia (34-35 °C) is probably the most effective approach to protect the brain from ischemic insults. Most of the supportive data were obtained in animal models of ischemia. Several phase II trials have shown safety and feasibility of cooling subjects with stroke, in the hours following onset of symptoms. Early interventions show the highest benefit.\n\nEligible patients will initiate cooling 60-90 min before CEA with endovascular cooling (Zoll system) to the target 34-35°C (assessed by bladder thermometer). The Zoll IVTM system is an endovascular cooling system that consists of a control module (either CoolGard 3000 or Thermogard XP), a CoolGard start-up kit, an ICY catheter (either IC-3585 AE or IC-3585 CO or IC-3893 AE or IC-3893 CO), a catheter convenience kit for catheter insertion (CO models only), thermal probes and cables. All the devise component have CE mark. The Low temperature will be maintained during the CEA procedure, followed by gradual, passive, controlled rewarming (0.4 °C/h). Type of anaesthesia will be decided according to good clinical practice. The cooling procedure will be, therefore, carried out during the anaesthesia procedure required by the surgical intervention. There is a chance that the duration of the anaesthesia will be longer that required, but all the efforts will be undertaken to keep the anaesthesia time as short as if there were no cooling\n\nClinical and instrumental evaluations will be carried out before and post intervention. Each evaluation will consist of physical examination, neuropsychological evaluation (MoCA test), blood tests and brain MRI or TC.\n\nSafety is evaluated on the basis of severe adverse event"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Hypothermia","Stroke","Carotid Artery Plaque","Carotid Artery Stenosis","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["carotid endarterectomy","stroke","hypothermia","endovascular cooling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single arm","type":"OTHER","description":"The endovascular cooling system will be Zoll IVTM.
