The first part includes passive functions, the second part includes active functions, and the third part includes the assessment of quality of life.\n\nIt is a valid and reliable test in adult neurological patients with lower extremity spasticity. It can be used in the evaluation of the active and passive functions of the results of the clinicians' interventions by making the cultural adaptation of the Turkish language and examining its validity and reliability. We think that it will be important to determine the limitations in activity, participation and daily living activities and to evaluate their reflections.","detailedDescription":"Spasticity is a common symptom resulting from stroke, brain trauma, and degenerative brain diseases. Spasticity, known as rate-dependent resistance to passive movement, prevents many activities of daily living. Lower extremity spasticity, on the other hand, hinders joint movements and complicates mobility, transfer and passive activities of caregivers.\n\nGoals for the treatment of spasticity often focus on active function improvements in walking, standing, and moving from different sitting positions. However, improvements in passive function tasks and symptom management are often equally important to patients. Active function is the use of the limb to directly perform a task. Passive fonskyion is care of the affected extremity, usually performed by the person himself, but may require assistance from another person.\n\nThere is a need for instruments with demonstrable measurement properties that can reflect a clinically significant change in practice. Outcomes developed for treatments such as botulinum toxin and physical interventions for spasticity aimed at improving any aspect of functional performance (active and passive function) should ideally reflect real-life function as opposed to simply observed tasks in the clinical setting.\n\nLeg activity measure filled by the patient consists of three parts. The first part includes passive functions, the second part includes active functions, and the third part includes the assessment of quality of life.\n\nIt is a valid and reliable test in adult neurological patients with lower extremity spasticity. It can be used in the evaluation of the active and passive functions of the results of the clinicians' interventions by making the cultural adaptation of the Turkish language and examining its validity and reliability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injuries","Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["activity","participation","spasticity","passive function","active function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Weeks","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with spasticity","description":"adult neurological patients with spasticities in their lower extremities","interventionNames":["Other: assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"assessment","description":"Turkish version of Leg Activity Measure Rivearmead Mobility Index Nottingham Health Profile Functional Independence Measures","armGroupLabels":["Patients with spasticity"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Turkish version of Leg Activity Measure","description":"Leg activity measure consists of three parts.
