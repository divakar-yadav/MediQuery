The most common consequences of stroke are functional impairments, cognitive impairments, depression and fatigue. These are also regarded as barriers to achieve optimal adherence to the guidelines regarding secondary prevention. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal individualized intervention to prevent functional decline in the long term after stroke.","detailedDescription":"In a clinical randomized controlled trial, participants randomized to the intervention arm will be followed with monthly meetings by a stroke coordinator for 18 months.\n\nThe stroke coordinator will assess the patients risk factors within the domains of physical function, cognitive function, social function, medication and lifestyle factors and make a treatment plan targeting the individual needs for further follow-up.\n\nThose randomized to the control group will receive standard care.\n\nPatients living in the municipalities of Trondheim, LÃ¸renskog and Skedsmo admitted to Akershus University Hospital or St. Olavs University Hospital will be included at the outpatients clinic 3 months after the stroke.\n\nAll patients will be re-assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months after inclusion.
