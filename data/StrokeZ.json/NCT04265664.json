Regaining walking ability is a priority for most and is achieved in approximately 80%. Unfortunately, the occurrence of falling while walking is as high as 73% of all people who recover the ability to walk post-stroke, with falls often occurring within the first few months of returning home from rehabilitation. This highlights the challenges with transitioning to the community for continued post-stroke rehabilitation. Unfortunately, due to increasing demand on our healthcare and rehabilitation systems and limited service capacity, stroke survivors receive minimal to no follow-up rehabilitation after returning to community-living. As a result, it is common for stroke survivors to report unmet lower extremity rehabilitation needs, and thus ongoing walking/mobility impairment, balance issues, high incidence of falls, and difficulties participating in desired social roles.\n\nThe rapid growth in the use of the Internet and personal mobile technologies, including computers, smartphones, and tablets has opened up an array of possibilities through which patients can remotely access specialized health services, such as telerehabilitation supports, while in their homes and communities. The use of technologies to facilitate optimal rehabilitation and recovery after stroke is under-utilized in Canada, despite being highly recommended in Canadian stroke guidelines, and positive beliefs about its potential among people with stroke.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. To examine the feasibility (e.g. safety, recruitment rate, retention rate, fidelity and adherence, burden) of a lower extremity telerehabilitation protocol among community-living stroke survivors\n2. To estimate the size of effect of TRAIL on clinical outcomes of functional mobility, lower extremity strength and motor impairment, functional balance, quality of life, balance self-efficacy, and goal attainment among community-living stroke survivors\n\nHypotheses:\n\nThe investigators expect that the the telerehabilitation protocol will demonstrate sufficient feasibility to support a larger, multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT). The investigators also hypothesize that stroke survivors will improve in functional mobility, lower extremity strength and motor impairment, functional balance, quality of life, balance self-efficacy, and goal attainment following 4-weeks of telerehabilitation with a trained therapist\n\nThis feasibility study will use a single group, pre- post- study design trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Cerebral Vascular Disorder","Brain Ischemia","Brain Infarction","Cardiovascular Diseases","Infarction"],"keywords":["Telerehabilitation","Lower extremity","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single-group, pre-post study design","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telerehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receives the telerehabilitation protocol","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Telerehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Telerehabilitation","description":"Participants in the telerehabilitation program will receive a graded exercise and self-management intervention.
