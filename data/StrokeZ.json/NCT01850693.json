CAD is an important cause of death in patients with stroke.\n\nCurrently, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is very useful non-invasive tool for detection of CAD and plaque analysis.\n\nTherefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the prevalence, plaque characteristics (plaque types, stenosis degree, remodeling) and predictors of CAD in stroke patients through follow-up (more than 5 years) using CCTA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease"],"keywords":["coronary artery disease","stroke","coronary CT angiography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1657,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Coronary artery disease, Stroke","description":"Coronary artery disease, stroke, coronary CT angiography"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Event)","description":"MACE was included as follows: 1) all-cause mortality, 2) myocardial infarction, 3) unstable angina requiring hospitalization","timeFrame":"Participants will be followed until June. 2015, an expeded average of 5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Any cardiac events","description":"1) late revascularization: who underwent revascularization therapy mroe than 90days after CCTA and referral due ot new symptoms or an abnormal function test, 2) heart failure required hospitalization.","timeFrame":"Participants will be followed until June. 2015, an expeded average of 5 years"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Repeated stroke","description":"newly developed stroke after CCTA scan","timeFrame":"Participants will be followed until June. 2015, an expeded average of 5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute stroke patients who diagnosed by clinical and brain MR imaging\n* Who performed coronary CT angiography within 3 months after acute stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* intracranial hemorrhage including intracerebral, subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage\n* brain tumor\n* Previous myocardial infarction\n* Previously performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or other cardiac surgery\n* Insufficient medical record\n* Poor image quality of CCTA scan","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients on the basis of TOAST classification","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Eun Ju Chun, MD","affiliation":"Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital","city":"Seongnam-si","state":"Gyeonggi-do","zip":"436-707","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.43861,"lon":127.13778}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M25878","name":"Atherosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
