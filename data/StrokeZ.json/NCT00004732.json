Stents are medical devices approved and commonly used for treatment of heart disease. The stent that will be used in this trial is the Rapid Exchange(RX) ACCULINK(TM) Carotid Stent System, an elastic-like metal scaffold that is expanded inside a carotid artery to hold the vessel open.\n\nThe RX ACCUNET(TM) Embolic Protection System (an umbrella-like device that expands above the narrowed portion of the carotid artery) will be used in conjunction with the RX ACCULINK stent. The RX ACCUNET system is designed to capture embolic material that could break off from the narrowed area in the carotid artery while still allowing blood to flow through the vessel during the procedure. Embolic material could block blood flow to the arteries beyond the narrowing and be harmful to the brain. The RX ACCUNET System is closed and removed after the stent is placed.\n\nCEA involves a neck incision and physical removal of the plaque from the inside of the artery. CAS involves insertion of a catheter or tube into an artery in the groin and then threading the catheter through the arteries of the body to the location of the plaque within the carotid artery in the neck. The stent is then placed to cover the plaque and hold the artery open. Participants will be randomly assigned to undergo either CAS or CEA, and all patients will receive best medical management, which includes treatment with aspirin, treatment of high blood pressure, and treatment of other stroke risk factors. Participants will be followed for up to ten years.\n\nWith the simplification of the protocol for long-term follow-up, the focus for secondary outcomes is to assess restenosis and viability of the procedure. Restenosis rates on an annual basis in both the endarterectomy and stenting arms of the study will be assessed using carotid duplex ultrasound exams performed annually (standard of care).\n\nIn addition to restenosis, the \"viability\" of the procedures will be assessed by the need (or lack of need) for repeat revascularization (either open surgical or endovascular) after the index procedure. The question \"has a new carotid intervention been performed since last follow-up\" will be asked at every contact with the patient. If answered positively, additional data will be collected on the appropriate case report forms(CRFs).\n\nLINKAGE OF CREST COHORT WITH CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES(CMS) ADMINISTRATIVE DATA\n\nThe purpose of linking Medicare-eligible CREST participants with CMS data files is to assess patient outcomes and utilization of health care services. This plan to link in- and out-patient episodes of care using national Medicare data establishes a new resource that will enhance current follow-up strategies, as well as explore alternative strategies to ascertain patient outcomes for future clinical studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atherosclerosis","Stroke","Carotid Stenosis","Cerebral Infarction","Myocardial Infarction"],"keywords":["angioplasty","asymptomatic","atherosclerosis","carotid endarterectomy","carotid stenting","CREST","Cerebral Infarction","device","intervention","restenosis","revascularization","stenosis","stent","stroke","symptomatic","surgery","transient ischemic attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2502,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carotid Artery Endarterectomy (CEA)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Carotid endarterectomy is surgery to remove plaque buildup that causes narrowing (stenosis) in the carotid artery.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA)"]},{"label":"Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a procedure used to open narrowed carotid arteries.
