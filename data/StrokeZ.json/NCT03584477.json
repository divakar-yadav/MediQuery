Most patients do not recover functional use of their paretic upper limb.\n\nThe use of robotic assistance provides intensive motor training through a large number of repetitive movements, usually oriented and interactive tasks (pointing tasks, tracking paths tasks...). These feature have been demonstrated to be critical to stimulate brain plasticity after a brain damage. The InMotion Arm 2.0 manipulator works with an adaptive algorithm that provide patients with real-time Assistance-as-Needed™ desgned to enhance motor performance.\n\nHypothesis: In the sub-acute phase of stroke, the structured practice of a large number of repeated movements will increase motor function of the upper limb compared to conventional rehabilitation. Secondly, this practice will be more effective in a free active mode (without assistance) than an active assisted mode (Assistance-as-Needed™).\n\nExpected secondary benefits: Subjective impression of improved use of the upper limb in activities of daily living and reduction of spastic cocontractions affecting the agonist and antagonist muscles during movements of the upper limb.\n\nObjectives: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of structured repetition programs of arm movements, on the function of the hemiparetic upper limb and motor control, between 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, using a robotic device with or without assistance in partial substitution of conventional rehabilitation care, compared to a program with conventional care alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Robot,","Rehabilitation","Hemiparesis","Upper limb","Function","Motor control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"5 sessions / week of 1 hour of occupational therapy","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Robotic rehabilitation with assistance","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"5 sessions / week of 1 hour of rehabilitation of the upper limb with 30 min of conventional rehabilitation and 30 min of robotic rehabilitation with assistance.","interventionNames":["Device: Robot InMotion 2.0","Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Non-assistance robotic rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"5 sessions / week of 1 hour of rehabilitation of the upper limb including 30 min of conventional rehabilitation and 30 min of robotic rehabilitation without assistance.","interventionNames":["Device: Robot InMotion 2.0","Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot InMotion 2.0","description":"Repetitive work of large numbers of targeted alternative movements with or without assistance.
