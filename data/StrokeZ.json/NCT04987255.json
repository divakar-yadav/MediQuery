Physical activity is limited mainly by the lack of accessibility to activities offered in the city and the lack of motivation.\n\nThe objective is to study the physical solicitations and the well-being during the visit of a museum (free or guided visit). Our hypothesis is that this cultural activity induces a sufficient physical solicitation for sedentary people and for individuals with a post-stroke motor disability.\n\nAll the tests will be carried out during the same day by experienced physiotherapists. Physical and well-being tests will be performed before and after the visits. The number of steps taken during the visit will be measured.\n\nThis is a different approach to promote physical activity and this proposal is an original way to stimulate the physical, psychic and social health of sedentary people. If the results are beneficial, museums could become real health partners to stimulate the activity of sedentary people."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sedentary Behavior","Stroke"],"keywords":["Physical activity","Museum","Well-being","Sedentary","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":85,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Free visit","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Free visit of the museum during 75 minutes for individuals in sedentary condition (healthy)","interventionNames":["Other: Free visit"]},{"label":"Guided visit","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Guided visit of the museum during 75 minutes for individuals in sedentary condition (healthy)","interventionNames":["Other: Guided visit"]},{"label":"Guided visit for individuals after stroke","type":"OTHER","description":"This arm is specific for individuals with motor disability after stroke (non randomized condition)","interventionNames":["Other: Guided visit (stroke)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Free visit","description":"The persons with sedentary (healthy) in this group will have to visit the museum freely (without a guide) for a period of 75 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Free visit"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Guided visit","description":"The persons with sedentary (healthy) in this group will have to visit the museum with a guide for a period of 75 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Guided visit"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Guided visit (stroke)","description":"The persons with motor disability after stroke in this group will have to visit the museum with a guide for a period of 75 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Guided visit for individuals after stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of steps during visit in the three groups (free visit vs. guided visit and guided visit for individuals with stroke)","description":"An activity tracker on the visitor's wrist will measure the number of steps taken while visiting the museum.
