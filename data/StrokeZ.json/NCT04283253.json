Baseline testing will occur in the first 4-6 weeks of participation including two separate sessions approximately 1 week a part to examine arm strength, range of motion, and ability to perform functional tasks, with one additional session if needed to verify stability between results. Additionally, one robot evaluation will be completed.\n\nThe intervention phase consists of 12 weeks of robot and transition to task arm exercise training (TTT). Interventions will occur approximately 3 times per week for 12 weeks for a total of 36 visits. Additional time and visits will be allowed with visits occurring 4 times per week or up to 6 additional weeks (not to exceed 18 weeks) if scheduling conflicts arise. The intervention sessions will be one hour in duration.\n\nDuring the hour-long intervention, 45 minutes of robotic intervention will be followed by 15 minutes of TTT. The training will be sequential with 12 sessions focused on the wrist, followed by 12 sessions on the shoulder-elbow and the final 12 sessions alternating between the wrist and elbow-shoulder.\n\nAfter the final training session, subjects will return after a 12 week retention period. At various time points during and after the intervention phase there will be additional arm function testing, robot evaluations, questionnaires, MRI and TMS sessions for re-assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"One-arm, multiple baseline sequential, cohort study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot + TTT Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will be enrolled in this group to receive the same 60 minute study intervention consisting of wrist and shoulder-elbow robot training and TTT arm exercises.","interventionNames":["Device: Robot + TTT exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot + TTT exercise","description":"The intervention will be completed 36 visits approximately 3x/week for 12-18 weeks.
