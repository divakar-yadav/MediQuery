About 60% to 80% of which are ischemic stroke. In recent years, stroke has replaced heart disease and tumor diseases as the first cause of death and disability in adult population. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of indobufen treatment in reducing the risk of a 3-month new stroke (any type of stroke, including ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke) for patients with moderate/severe ischemic stroke is not inferior to aspirin therapy. The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, positive drug parallel control and non-inferiority clinical design.\n\nNon-inferiority analysis was performed on the primary efficacy analysis, and both intent analysis (ITT) and compliance program set (PPS) were used for analysis. If the indobufen group was confirmed to be non-inferior to aspirin (control group), a superiority analysis was further performed to analyze whether the indobufen was superior to aspirin. At the same time, Kaplan-Meier curves were used to simulate the cumulative risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) at 90-day follow-up, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval, Log-rank test was used to evaluate the treatment effect. All statistics will be two-sided with p\\<0.05 considered significant.\n\nAll patients who received study drugs and with at least one safety follow-up record will be included in the safety population. The data for safety evaluation included adverse reactions observed during the trial and changes in laboratory data before and after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Indobufen","Aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5438,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Indobufen","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drug: Indobufen and aspirin mimetic Day 1 to 90±7: The first time : Indobufen 100mg + aspirin mimetic The second time: indobufen 100mg","interventionNames":["Drug: Indobufen"]},{"label":"Aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Drug: Aspirin and Indobufen mimetic Day 1 to 90±7: The first time : aspirin 100mg+ Indobufen mimetic, The second time: indobufen mimetic.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Indobufen","description":"Indobufen inhibits platelet aggregation by reversibly inhibiting the platelet cyclooxygenase enzyme thereby suppressing thromboxane synthesis.","armGroupLabels":["Indobufen"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"Aspirin is a salicylate (sa-LIS-il-ate).

For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment.
