Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=12) or the control group (n=13). NMES has applied to the non-affected side ankle dorsiflexors five sessions for a week in both groups. In addition to the experimental group, the cold application was applied on the affected side dorsiflexor muscle skin. The cold application was done on a moist towel for five minutes using a cold pack. A five-minute break was given and a further 5-minute cold application was repeated. The cold application was done simultaneously with NMES. A conventional rehabilitation program was applied to all patients by a physiotherapist. Before and after treatment, both ankle dorsiflexor strength was measured with a force sensor. For force measurements, a force transducer (FC2211-0000-0100-L Compression Load Cell, TE Connectivity company, France) was used. Force transducer signals were received with a data acquisition device (POWERLAB® data acquisition system ADInstruments, Oxford, UK) and evaluated offline on the computer. The measurement values were expressed in kilogram.force (kg.f) and this value was normalized according to body weight."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke","Muscle Weakness"],"keywords":["Cold therapy","Cross-education","Neuromuscular electrical stimulation","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cold Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The patients have seated the knee joints in full extension and both ankle joints in a neutral position.
