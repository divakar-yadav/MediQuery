Dysphagic stroke patients are at increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. Pneumonia accounts for at least 10% of post stroke deaths within 30 days of hospitalization after stroke. rTMS is effective in improving post-stroke dysphagia and swallowing coordination after stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere, however it's efficacy on the prevalence of pneumonia has not yet been examined.\n\nPurpose of the study: To determine the effect of adding repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to conventional oropharyngeal physical therapy program on the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in in patients with post stroke dysphagia.","detailedDescription":"Thirty Five acute ischemic stroke patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia from both sexes represented the sample of this study. They were diagnosed by a neurologist and stroke diagnosis was confirmed by brain MRI and/or CT. They were selected from the stroke unit El Kasr El Ainy hospital, Cairo university.\n\nThey were randomly assigned into two equal groups, the control group (A) and the study group (B). Control group (GA) will be treated using a designed physical therapy intervention for oropharyngeal dysphagia consists of neuromuscular electrical stimulation combined with physical therapeutic exercise for oropharyngeal muscles in addition to sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Study group (GB) will be treated with low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS to the contralesional cerebral hemisphere in addition to the same Oropharyngeal physical therapy program for dysphagia as in group A.\n\nStroke dysphagia was diagnosed by a neurologist. The Gugging swallowing screen (GUSS) bedside screening test will be used to detect dysphagia and aspiration risk. A2DS2 scale is used to detect stroke associated pneumonia (SAP). Stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) will be diagnosed according to the criteria of the modified Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Dysphagia","Pneumonia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Dysphagia","Stroke Associated Pneumonia (SAP)","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Contralesional hemisphere"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Controlled Clinical trial, where the recruited patients will be randomly assigned into 2 equal groups ( GA \\& GB) using sealed envelopes, control group (GA) and study group (GB).
