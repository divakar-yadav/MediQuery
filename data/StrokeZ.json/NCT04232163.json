Both groups will complete the same intervention program. The Immediate treatment group will start the program right away while the Delayed Treatment group will start the program after a 3 week delay. The intervention program is 3 weeks in duration and consists of participants completing at least two hours of exercises (adapted from the Home-GRASP program) daily and wearing an activity monitor on their affected wrist during waking hours for the duration of the intervention. Participants will be asked to meet daily movement count goals based on information from the monitor. Participants will have 6 virtual sessions with a therapist who will teach and monitor exercises thru an online platform (Zoom Video Communications), work with participants to generate and progress daily movement goals and discuss barriers and potential solutions to exercise adherence and/or meeting movement goals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Ischemia","Brain Infarction","Vascular Diseases","Infarction","Nervous System Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"],"keywords":["Stroke","Upper extremity","Rehabilitation","Wearable device","Exercise","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Immediate Treatment Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive the intervention right away","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Arm Boot Camp"]},{"label":"Delayed Treatment Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants will receive usual care (no intervention), however, they will receive the intervention after a 3 week delay"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Arm Boot Camp","description":"The intervention involves a combination of daily homework based upper limb exercises and feedback from an activity monitor to motivate use of the affected upper limb.
