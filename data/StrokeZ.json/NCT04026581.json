Innovative resources will be employed to support the standard of care without considering limitations based on service billing codes. Clinical services will include AAC assessment, AAC-BCI device and treatment to individuals with minimal movement due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain stem strokes, severe cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their family support person. This is a descriptive study designed to measure and monitor the communication performance of individuals using the AAC-BCI, any other AAC strategies, their user satisfaction and perceptions of communication effectiveness, and the satisfaction of the family support persons.","detailedDescription":"This clinical trial follows a descriptive study design collecting data to measure and monitor variables related to the standard of care in providing speech language pathology augmentative and alternative communication clinical (AAC) assessment and treatment. The study tracks participants through the AAC, speech generating device trial and AAC-BCI trial processes. In addition this study measures and monitors the communication performance of individuals using the AAC-BCI and any other AAC strategies for treatment in the home. Data on communication performance, user satisfaction, and perceptions of communication effectiveness are gathered over monthly visits along with the satisfaction and perceptions of communication effectiveness by the family support persons."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Brain Stem Stroke","Cerebral Palsy","Traumatic Brain Injury","Speech Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Assessment","description":"A comprehensive AAC assessment collecting clinical and personal data required to select a speech-generating device (SGD) is conducted along with a trial of three AAC technology solutions, followed by a trial for BCI access to an AAC system.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speech generating device (SGD) evaluation including BCI access"]},{"label":"Training and Treatment","description":"AAC training and treatment services will be provided and communication performance outcomes monitored over the course of studying clinical treatment services.
