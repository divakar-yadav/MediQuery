Designing a RCT trial to prove the effect and safety.","detailedDescription":"Vulnerable plaque of carotid artery is the important intervention target for primary prevention and secondary prevention of cerebral arterial thrombosis, but there are no effective, safe and prevalent treatment measures against it. The development that traditional Chinese medicine has achieved in treating plaque of carotid artery shows that great accomplishment could be made within this area. Academia should engage in clinical research on regulated treatment methods in traditional Chinese medicine with long-term intervention and high patient compliance, providing strong evidence for evidence-based medicine and guidance to clinical practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Plaque"],"keywords":["herbal medicine","stroke","vulnerable plaques of carotid artery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Herbal Medicine C-117","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Herbal Medicine C-117 Prescription (6g/bag，one bag each time, twice a day.) for 6 months","interventionNames":["Drug: Herbal Medicine C-117"]},{"label":"The Placebo of Herbal Medicine C-117","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo of Herbal Medicine C-117 (6g/bag，one bag each time, twice a day.) for 6 months","interventionNames":["Drug: The Placebo of Herbal Medicine C-117"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Herbal Medicine C-117","description":"Herbal Medicine C-117 formula including 2 herbals and 2 insects","armGroupLabels":["Herbal Medicine C-117"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"The Placebo of Herbal Medicine C-117","description":"The Placebo of Herbal Medicine C-117 formula including 4 herbals","armGroupLabels":["The Placebo of Herbal Medicine C-117"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The total number of all-cause mortality and all-cause stroke within 12 months","description":"After drug-use 6 months, observe all-cause mortality and all-cause stroke (hemorrhage or ischemic).","timeFrame":"1 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The nature of Vulnerable plaque of carotid artery through color ultrasound","description":"At the time of 6 months, observe the nature of Vulnerable plaque of carotid artery through color ultrasound, comparing with the result before using drugs","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"The number of Vulnerable plaque of carotid artery through color ultrasound","description":"At the time of 6 months, observe the nature of Vulnerable plaque of carotid artery through color ultrasound, comparing with the result before using","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Blood lipid levels","description":"At the time of 6 months, the investigators will observe the blood lipid levels","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
