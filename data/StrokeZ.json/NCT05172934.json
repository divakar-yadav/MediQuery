Participants will receive IA TNK after achieving mTICI 2b or 2c reperfusion with standard of care MT. Patients enrolled into the study will be followed for 3 months after treatment with IA TNK.","detailedDescription":"As current MT technology is not amenable to retrieval of distal occlusions (M3/M4, etc), we hypothesize that IA lytic may play an important role as an adjunctive therapy to open up distal vessels (after the primary LVO has been removed) to achieve complete or near complete reperfusion. In this pilot trial, our goal is to assess the feasibility and safety of IA Tenecteplase (TNK) as an adjunctive therapy following standard of care mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with AIS. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled into the ALLY pilot study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["thrombolytic","stroke","distal emboli"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will receive intra-arterial Tenecteplase after achieving mTICI 2b or 2c reperfusion with standard of care mechanical thrombectomy.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intra-arterial Tenecteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive intra-arterial Tenecteplase after achieving mTICI 2b or 2c reperfusion with standard of care MT.","interventionNames":["Drug: intra-arterial tenecteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"intra-arterial tenecteplase","description":"intra-arterial drug administered after mechanical thrombectomy","armGroupLabels":["Intra-arterial Tenecteplase"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of any intracranial hemorrhage and neurologic worsening","description":"Incidence of any intracranial hemorrhage and neurologic worsening of at least 4 points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (ECASS-II) criteria, within 24 hours of treatment with IA TNK","timeFrame":"24 hours post-treatment with intra-arterial Tenecteplase"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Improved reperfusion","description":"Proportion of patients with improved reperfusion (mTICI 2c/3) at end of IA treatment","timeFrame":"immediate post-treatment"},{"measure":"Improved reperfusion","description":"Proportion of patients with improvement of reperfusion to mTICI 2c, mTICI 3, and mTICI 2c-3.","timeFrame":"immediate post-treatment"},{"measure":"Ordinal modified Rankin Scale Score","description":"Ordinal modified Rankin Scale Score at 90 days.
