MCIMT treatment applied together with TES will be performed with electric stimulation without causing discomfort in patients with stroke and at the same time, the duration of use of the affected extremity can be extended with task-oriented exercises with MCIMT treatment. In this way, the efficiency of the applied treatment program will be evaluated, and the gains obtained will be investigated and presented as a suggestion to physiotherapists working with stroke patients. Before and after the treatment program we will evaluate, the pain level of the participants measured with a visual pain scale; sensory functions with Semmes Weinstein monofilament test battery; muscle tone, and spasticity with the modified Tardieu scale and Digital Palpation Device, which has a very high proof value; functional status with Wolf motor function test and Motor Activity Log; quality of life will be assessed by Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale.

The first group will be treated with M-CIMT, the second group will be treated with MCIMT with TES for 4 weeks, and the third group will be the control group. A total of 45 participants will be included in the study. Participants in all three groups will be included in the routine conventional physiotherapy program. MCIMT and TES treatment will be applied three days a week for a total of four weeks. Each treatment session will continue for one and a half hours. A total of two evaluations will be applied before and after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","Electrical stimulation","Upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment Randomized","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group-1 (M-CIMT group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"participants in this group will be trained with Modified Constraint Induced Therapy (M-CIMT) in addition to conventional therapy. M-CIMT is shorter versions of CIMT. The original CIMT devotes six or more hours for therapy and constraining of the intact arm for 90% of waking hours per day and over a period of two weeks. Researchers have observed that such a schedule of CIMT is exhaustive and possibly resulting in non-compliance. Because of this reason,s Modified shorter versions of CIMT (mCIMT) have been designed by researchers. Duration of M-CIMT interventions varies from 2 to 10 weeks and the treatment time also varies from as short as 30 minutes to three hours per day in various studies. Nevertheless both CIMT and mCIMT have shown promising success. M-CIMT emphasizes massed practice with the affected upper limb.","interventionNames":["Other: Modified Constraint Induced Therapy and Threshold Electrical Stimulation"]},{"label":"Experimental group-2 (M-CIMT+TES group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"participants in this group will be trained with Modified Constraint Induced Therapy (M-CIMT) and threshold electrical stimulation (TES) in addition to conventional therapy.

In this method, the severity of spasticity is evaluated at different rates determined. At the joint, the first angle at which the increase in resistance is detected is recorded. The range of motion is compared to the angle at completion. The Stretching Velocities are as follows: V1: As slow as possible (slower than the gravity fall speed of the limb segment) V2: At the rate of gravity fall of the limb V3: As fast as possible (faster than the normal gravity fall speed of the limb).","timeFrame":"Change from baseline severity of spasticity at week 4."},{"measure":"Superficial sensory function","description":"The Semmes Weinstein monofilament test battery will be used to evaluate the superficial sense of upper extremity.

The patient scores himself between 0 and 5 (0 = I do not use my affected arm at all, 5 = I use my affected arm with the same frequency/quality as before the stroke).
