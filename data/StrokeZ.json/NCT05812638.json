The term 'stroke' is mostly used when there is sudden loss of function of the body due any abrupt changes.The rates of disability are increasing along with mortality and morbidity rates due to stroke. The poor motor performance of lower limb affects gait severely. The slow velocity and other gait deviations limit the stroke survivors' ability to perform ADL's and interfere with their quality of life.\n\nHence, rehabilitation is obligatory for these patients to improve their quality of life","detailedDescription":"motor imagery is helpful in improving mobility in healthy and neurologically impaired patients. When the patient is asked to do a movement, for example the patient is asked to walk along a draw line and then that patient has to imagine this same action in kinesthetic imagery. Neuroimaging shows that brain areas are more or less activated in the same manner. It can be concluded that there is some relation between mental imagery ability and muscular actions. In the stroke patients who have intact ability of mental imagery show activation of cortical areas demonstrating its ability to activate sub cortical areas also. Therefore, these results amplify the concept of using mental imagery for rehabilitation purpose of even deep lesion in motor nervous system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mental Imagery","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For mental imagery, the calm and nice atmosphere isrequired for the patientsto focus on the details while sitting on a chair.

In this phase patients have asked to do the deep breathing exercises while sitting on a chair and then contract their lower limb muscles from distal to proximal. The second phase is task-oriented phase. The patient has to imagine him performing the tasks.","interventionNames":["Other: Mental imagery technique"]},{"label":"Virtual Reality","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The virtual reality training will be given through Kinect connected with Xbox 360.\n\nThe Xbox games used are 20,000 water leaks, reflex ridge and river rush.
