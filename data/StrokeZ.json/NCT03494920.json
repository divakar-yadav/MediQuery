Randomised patients will be stratified for site of baseline arterial occlusion into one of three groups: 1. internal carotid artery (ICA) 2. middle cerebral artery (MCA) 3. basilar artery (BA). Patients will be randomised to either bridging intravenous thrombolysis with endovascular clot retrieval (ECR), or direct endovascular clot retrieval.","detailedDescription":"The DIRECT-SAFE trial will include patients with acute ischemic stroke, who are ≥18 years of age and are eligible for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. Patients will be assessed for large vessel occlusion to determine their eligibility for randomization into the trial. Eligible vessel occlusions include the internal carotid artery, basilar artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 or M2). Patients will be consented after large vessel occlusion is confirmed based on standard care multimodal imaging.\n\nPatients will be recruited in Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore and Europe. Randomisation either direct to ECR or standard thrombolytic therapy and ECR shall be in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nAll patients will have a multimodal MR (or CT/CTP at investigator's discretion if MRI not possible) at 18 to 30 hours post treatment to assess reperfusion, recanalization, ischemic core growth and hemorrhagic transformation. Final follow up will occur at Day 90."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemia","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases","Pathologic Processes","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Tissue Plasminogen Activator","Plasminogen","Fibrinolytic Agents","Fibrin Modulating Agents","Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be randomised to either direct endovascular clot retrieval or to bridging intravenous thrombolysis with endovascular clot retrieval.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Blinded core laboratory adjudications of the primary outcome.
