However, despite reperfusion of the ischemia-affected area, some patients do not recover clinically. The reason for this is not known exactly. It is known that age and baseline function, which are thought to indicate brain reserve, affect the long-term outcome of stroke. Chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease, which are associated with low brain reserve, are quite common in acute ischemic stroke patients.\n\nThere is controversy as to whether general anesthesia (GA) or sedoanalgesia (SA) should be used during EMT for acute ischemic stroke. There are not enough randomized trials addressing this question. Benefits of GA include airway preservation, pain control and potentially improved radiographic imaging and patient immobility for intervention. Conversely, GA is time-consuming and possibly associated with longer time for groin puncture and revascularization. In addition, hypotension may occur during GA, which carries a greater risk of ischemic damage. Advantages of SA may include shorter time to revascularization, fewer hemodynamic problems and the possibility of better neurological assessment during the procedure. The main arguments against SA are that patient movement can lead to procedural complications, higher radiation dose, the need for more contrast media and lack of airway control. Simonsen et al. compared general anesthesia and conscious sedation in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular treatment (GOLIATH) and showed that the choice of different anesthesia method can affect infarct area growth, clinical outcomes, and important physiological and anesthetic parameters.\n\nAgain, in the SIESTA (Sedation vs Intubation for Endovascular Stroke Treatment) study comparing sedation and intubation in endovascular stroke treatment, no significant difference was shown between both groups when early neurological recovery was compared (24th hour NIHSS). In this study, no superiority of conscious sedation over general anesthesia was demonstrated.\n\nIn the ESCAPE and SWIFT study, general anesthesia and conscious sedation were compared and conscious sedation was associated with better outcome than general anesthesia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Anesthesia","Neurologic Symptoms"],"keywords":["general anesthesia","sedoanalgesia","neurological outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients were divided into two groups as sedoanalgesia group (SA=31 patients) and general anesthesia group (GA=31 patients).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The study was double-blinded, patients were selected by closed envelope method, and different clinicians administered anesthesia and postoperative follow-up.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sedoanalgesia (SA) group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The aim was to achieve a moderate level of sedoanalgesia (previously called conscious sedation) that would reduce agitation, anxiety and mobility but allow communication with the patient.
