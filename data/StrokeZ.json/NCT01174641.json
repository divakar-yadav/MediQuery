This project will provide the largest scale and most detailed examination to date of whether problems in attention after stroke can be remediated through direct brain stimulation. In Part 1 of the project the investigators will use two forms of direct brain stimulation (neural inhibition) to try and balance activity across the two sides of the brain following a stroke to one side. The investigators will assess whether each form of stimulation leads to an improvement in attentional functions, as well as to wider improvements in other cognitive abilities and to activities of everyday living. Performance will be tested immediately post remediation and on longer-term follow-up, and performance of the two intervention groups will be assessed against data the investigators have collected from a large-scale screen of cognitive impairments and recovery of function under standard treatment conditions. In Part 2 of the project the investigators will take the most promising intervention from Part 1 and the investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the brain changes that are linked to the recovery of attentional functions. The investigators will test whether recovery is linked to a change in the balance of activation within the two hemispheres of the brain, and whether there are associated structural changes in cortical tissue and fibre tracts. The project will evaluate whether neural inhibition can improve attentional functions in particular, and cognitive abilities and everyday activities more generally, in stroke survivors. It will also provide novel information on how recovery of function comes about within the brain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["unilateral neglect","TMS intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TMS intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Trans-cranial magnetic stimulation will be applied at a 1Hz rate for 20min over the ipsilesional posterior parietal cortex of patients showing left neglect after a right hemisphere stroke","interventionNames":["Other: trans-cranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Placebo TMS","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"1 Hz trans-cranial magnetic stimulation will be applied over the vertex","interventionNames":["Other: trans-cranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"trans-cranial magnetic stimulation","description":"1 Hz trans-cranial magnetic stimulation will be applied for 20min at 60% motor threshold over the vertex","armGroupLabels":["Placebo TMS"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"trans-cranial magnetic stimulation","description":"trans-cranial magnetic stimulation will be applied at 1Hz for 20 min over the ipsilesional posterior parietal cortex of stroke patients with unilateral neglect","armGroupLabels":["TMS intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Standardised measure of visual neglect","description":"A measure of unilateral neglect will be used","timeFrame":"9 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"measure of working memory","description":"a standardised measure of working memory from the Birmingham University Cognitive Screen (www.bucs.bham.ac.uk)","timeFrame":"9 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* presence of left unilateral neglect after right hemisphere stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* presence of epilepsy/family history of epilepsy\n* insufficient comprehension to follow instructions","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Glyn W Humphreys, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00441214144930","email":"g.w.humphreys@bham.ac.uk"},{"name":"Adrian Williams, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0044121472 1311","phoneExt":"2106","email":"adrian.williams@uhb.nhs.uk"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Glyn Humphreys, PhD","affiliation":"University of Birmingham","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Queen Elizabeth Hospital","city":"Birmingham","state":"West Midlands","zip":"B15","country":"United Kingdom","contacts":[{"name":"Glyn Humphreys, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"001214144930","email":"g.w.humphreys@bham.ac.uk"},{"name":"Adrian Williams, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0444121 472 1311","phoneExt":"2106","email":"adrian.williams@uhb.nhs.uk"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":52.48142,"lon":-1.89983}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
