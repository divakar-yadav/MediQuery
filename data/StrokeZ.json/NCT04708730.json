Our recent study imply that the neuroprotective effect of DELP involved multiple neuroprotective mechanism such as anti-inflammation, free radical scavenging, and decreasing MMP-9. Based on the multiple mechanisms, DELP was used to investigate the effect on acute ischemic stroke receiving endovascular treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
