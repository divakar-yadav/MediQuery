Moreover, it has also considered that the ground level is the most common locomotion surface, and that there is little information about the effects of gait training, on this kind of surface, in people with hemiparesis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis","Stroke"],"keywords":["kinematic","hemiparesis","gait","Body weight support","Functional electrical stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hemiparetic gait","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"gait training on ground level","interventionNames":["Device: gait training on ground level using BWS","Device: gait training on ground level using BWS associated to FES"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"gait training on ground level using BWS","description":"An A1-B-A2 system was applied in which A1 and A2 corresponded to gait training on ground level using Body Weight Support (BWS).
