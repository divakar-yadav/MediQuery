Study completion defined as acceptance of final research report and lay abstract by PCORI.","detailedDescription":"The investigators will seek to answer three questions:\n\n1. What are the person- and system-level factors associated with use of rehabilitation services following acute ischemic stroke?\n2. Among stroke survivors discharged to short-term inpatient rehabilitation, are high-intensity services performed at an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) more effective than lower intensity services performed at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), at improving patient outcomes at 3 and 12 months?\n3. Among stroke survivors discharged home, is early follow-up with a physician more effective than follow-up after 7 days at 3 and 12 months?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":164246,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"retrospective analysis","description":"Analysis of data for patients hospitalized in 2006-2008 with acute ischemic stroke, and successfully linked with Medicare claims through 2009"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Receiving Inpatient, Home, or Community Based Rehabilitation Services","description":"Received either inpatient care in an inpatient rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility, or home or community-based rehabilitation.","timeFrame":"discharge through 90 days"},{"measure":"Home-time","description":"Number of days alive and living outside of inpatient care","timeFrame":"12 months post-discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Were Functionally Dependent or Dead 12 Months After Hospital Discharge","description":"12-month functional status as measured by modified Rankin scale scores ranging between 0 (no symptoms) and 6 (death), among patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility.
