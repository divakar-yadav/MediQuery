Patients were randomly assigned to intervention and usual care groups. While the patients in the usual care group are given routine health services by the neurologist during their hospitalization and for 1 year after discharge; In addition to these routine services, the intervention group was provided with pharmaceutical care by a clinical pharmacist during the same period. The study was always conducted by the same neurologist and clinical pharmacist. Patient medication adherence, quality of life, and clinical parameters were evaluated at the beginning of the study and at the 12th month."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":260,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Clinical Pharmacist Led Pharmaceutical Care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to usual care services, the intervention group was provided with pharmaceutical care by a clinical pharmacist.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Clinical Pharmacist Led Pharmaceutical Care"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual Care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Clinical Pharmacist Led Pharmaceutical Care","description":"Within the scope of pharmaceutical care, medication review services for past and current medication use were provided by the clinical pharmacist.
