A subject sit comfortably 1m from a computer screen which presents visual instructions during the session. The robotic exoskeleton is fixed to the paretic hand. Subject visually fixate on a circle presented in the center of the screen and receive instructions from three surrounding rhomboidal arrows. Subject is given three commands instructing them to relax or imagine slow hand opening movement with the right or left hand. The \"Relax\" command means that the subject have to sit still and look at the center of the screen. Commands are presented randomly, each of 10 sec duration.\n\nA visual cue provides the subject with feedback regarding the mental task recognition: the central circle turned green if the classifier recognizes the task in agreement with the given command, or remains white if the signal is not recognized. In addition to visual feedback the subject is provided with kinesthetic feedback: the exoskeleton is opening the hand when the classifier recognizes the imagery of paretic hand movement.\n\nThe EEG is registered with 30 electrodes distributed over the head in accordance with the standard international 10-20 system. EEG signals are filtered from 5-30Hz. A Bayesian approach for EEG pattern classifying is used in the system. The activity sources most relevant for BCI functioning will be identified using an independent component analysis (ICA). Classification accuracy will by measured with Cohen's kappa (Kohavi and Provost, 1998). The procedure may consist from up to three sessions, the duration of 1 session is 10 min, there are 5 min time brake between session and total duration of procedure is up to 45 min. The number of procedures - at least 10. The maximal interval between procedures is 3 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Poststroke/CVA Paresis"],"keywords":["Post stroke hand paresis brain injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hand exoskeleton, brain-computer interface (BCI) 10 sessions of 45-minutes","interventionNames":["Device: hand exoskeleton, brain-computer interface (BCI),"]},{"label":"Placebo group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Hand exoskeleton, sham BCI 10 sessions of 45-minutes (BCI imitation)","interventionNames":["Device: hand exoskeleton, sham BCI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"hand exoskeleton, brain-computer interface (BCI),","description":"Hand exoskeleton, brain-computer interface (BCI) 10 sessions of 45-minutes","armGroupLabels":["Study group"],"otherNames":["mind-machine interface"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"hand exoskeleton, sham BCI","description":"Hand exoskeleton, sham BCI 10 sessions of 45-minutes (BCI imitation)","armGroupLabels":["Placebo group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from Baseline in hand paresis level and hand muscle spasticity","description":"ARAT; Fugl-Meyer, Modified Ashworth scale","timeFrame":"Week 2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Long-term changes from Baseline in hand paresis level and hand muscle spasticity","description":"ARAT; Fugl-Meyer, Modified Ashworth scale","timeFrame":"week 4, week 12, week 24"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed informed consent\n* Medical history of primary acute cerebrovascular event (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) at least 4 weeks before screening\n* focal stroke located in a hemisphere\n* post stroke hand paresis (mild to plegia according to Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale for Muscle Strength)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale \\< 22\n* Left handedness\n* Sensory aphasia\n* Severe impairment of vision\n* Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) â‰¥ 4","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Roman Lyukmanov, MD","affiliation":"Russian Academy of Medical Sciences","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Research Center of Neurology of RAMS","city":"Moscow","zip":"125367","country":"Russian Federation","geoPoint":{"lat":55.75222,"lon":37.61556}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Post-stroke Rehabilitation Training with a Motor-Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-Controlled Hand Exoskeleton: A Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00400/full"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000018908","term":"Muscle Weakness"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009135","term":"Muscular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000020879","term":"Neuromuscular Manifestations"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","asFound":"Paresis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4897","name":"Brain Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Paresis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4244","name":"Asthenia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11782","name":"Muscular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11787","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22309","name":"Neuromuscular Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"}]}},"hasResults":false}
