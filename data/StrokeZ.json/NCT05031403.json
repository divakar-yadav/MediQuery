With regular physiotherapy and rehabilitation, as well as patients' symptoms are brought under control, their affected functions in daily life are achieved and levels of independence and physical activity increase. Thus, the patients' quality of life and participation in social life is improved and patients are supported in physical, social and psychological terms. In recent years, it has been reported that exercise with telerehabilitation systems increase the compliance and participation of patients to the treatment, and even this system seems as effective as standard rehabilitation practices. Delivering the treatment through telerehabilitation system when that patients cannot receive it in the hospital due to epidemic, restriction, transfer difficulties, personal and environmental limitations will enable patients to receive the rehabilitation services.Telerehabilitation system is frequently encountered in the abroad, but there are limited systems with Turkish version specific to this patient group in our country. The aim of project is to develop and detect the efficiency of a telerehabilitation system which is used to assess, follow and design home-based rehabilitation program among individuals with chronic neurological diseases who have difficulty in participating in physiotherapy and rehabilitation services because of personal or environmental reasons.","detailedDescription":"The coding and design of this telerehabilitation system will enable easy access to all devices via the website. The expert interface of the system will consist of three interfaces; exercise videos to be prepared by physiotherapists will be uploaded, patient list and feedback of patients. Rehabilitation programs can be prepared and updated. There will be a panel in the patient interface that will allow the patient to access a rehabilitation program tailored to the problem and to communicate about the ongoing program when needed. In the manager interface, high-level control of many steps such as adding experts from different institutions, organizing information, creating an exercise pool will be provided. With the project, a telerehabilitation system will be put into practice, where patients can easily access the rehabilitation services from their homes, and patients can contact with clinicians when they need follow-up and treatment.\n\nThe patients and their caregivers will be informed about the system and project. In the assessment part, the physical performance will be determined. Also, questionnaires such as fall efficacy or activities of daily living will be requested through the system. Thus, a detailed assessment of the patient will be completed to reveal the problems. A rehabilitation program with appropriate exercises will be defined for patients in the telerehabilitation group and patients will be asked to apply this program three days a week for eight weeks. Patients in the control group will be placed on the waiting list after the first evaluations and no additional treatment will be applied by asking them to maintain their routine activity levels within this period. At the end of eight weeks, initial evaluations will be repeated in two groups.\n\nThis user-friendly telerehabilitation system with turkish language support will be the first comprehensive system that will let to assess, give exercise programs and follow the progression in patients with chronic neurologic disorders. With this system, the opportunity to reach more patients in the home environment will be provided. Rehabilitation programs will promote the physical capacity, health-related quality of life and it will also cause reducing in the burden of caregivers. After evaluating the applicability of our program, we will pave the way for the introduction of telerehabilitation care in health institutions and in areas with transportation issues, furthermore low-cost, sustainable system will be achieved to our country."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson Disease"],"keywords":["E-Health","Web Based Systems","Neurologic Rehabilitation","Neurorehabilitation","Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation","Stroke Rehabilitation","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson's Disease","Data Storage","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":114,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke (Telerehabilitation)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise therapy with telerehabilitation system","interventionNames":["Other: Telerehabilitaton"]},{"label":"Stroke (Home Exercise)","type":"OTHER","description":"Exercise therapy with brochure","interventionNames":["Other: Home Exercise"]},{"label":"Multiple Sclerosis (Telerehabilitation)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise therapy with telerehabilitation system","interventionNames":["Other: Telerehabilitaton"]},{"label":"Multiple Sclerosis (Home Exercise)","type":"OTHER","description":"Exercise therapy with brochure","interventionNames":["Other: Home Exercise"]},{"label":"Parkinson Disease (Telerehabilitation)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise therapy with telerehabilitation system","interventionNames":["Other: Telerehabilitaton"]},{"label":"Parkinson Disease (Home Exercise)","type":"OTHER","description":"Exercise therapy with brochure","interventionNames":["Other: Home Exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Telerehabilitaton","description":"Patients will be asked to apply the rehabilitation program defined for them 3 days a week for 8 weeks.
