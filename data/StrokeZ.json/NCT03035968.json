It is still unclear, which physiotherapeutic approaches are most effective. The Bobath-concept is one of the most widely used approaches in stroke rehabilitation within the western world, although several studies have failed to demonstrate superiority and showed partially even inferiority compared to other physiotherapy approaches. The Vojta therapy is based on a completely different approach - the reflex locomotion. However to date no study has been performed for stroke. We designed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare Vojta and conventional physiotherapy in patients with acute ischemic (AIS) or hemorrhagic stroke (ICH). This RCT will be the first trial to investigate improvement of postural control due to Vojta therapy in early rehabilitation of stroke patients, which is a very new approach in stroke-rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vojta Therapy","Reflex Locomotion"],"keywords":["Vojta therapy","reflex locomotion","stroke rehabilitation","stroke","physiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessor for the secondary outcome (Barthel Index and mRS after 90 days) is blinded.
