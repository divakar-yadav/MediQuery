Volunteers will be tested before and after the program and again 2 months later to measure the effects on stroke risk factors, fitness level and flexibility of the arteries. Blood tests will measure cholesterol levels and other signs of inflammation.\n\nThis study will help us better understand how exercise after stroke can improve heart function and heart health, and ultimately help in lowering future stroke risk.","detailedDescription":"Purpose\n\nTo determine the effects of aerobic exercise after stroke on cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiovascular function, stroke risk factors, walking and health-related quality of life. This study will also examine the retention of these effects after the exercise program ends.\n\nMethods\n\nA randomized controlled study design will be used. Sixty participants will be randomized to participate in one of 2 treatment arms (6 months duration, 3 days / week, 1 hour / session):\n\n1. BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY (non-aerobic) PROGRAM will be comprised of individualized upper and lower body stretching, or balance activities, yoga- or Tai Chi-style classes.\n2. AEROBIC PROGRAM will be comprised of a structured, progressive aerobic training program.\n\nParticipants will be evaluated at 3 time points - baseline (0 months), post-intervention (6 months) and follow up (8 months) - for stroke risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness, arterial stiffness, echocardiography measures, inflammatory biomarkers, ambulatory capacity and health-related quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Exercise","Rehabilitation","Risk factors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aerobic Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Aerobic Program will be the Experimental arm of this trial, where a structured, progressive aerobic exercise will be conducted in a class format","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic Exercise Program"]},{"label":"Balance and Flexibility Program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The Balance and Flexibility Program will be a non-aerobic intervention that will act as an Active Comparator.
