During the study period, the intervention group received bedside respiratory muscle training twice a day for three weeks. The respiratory muscle training consisted of (1) a breath stacking exercise, (2) inspiratory muscle training and (3) expiratory muscle training. The participants were evaluated at baseline and again at the end of the study (3 weeks later).\n\nMain Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes were measures of pulmonary function: functional vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak flow.\n\nSecondary outcomes were stroke-related disabilities assessed by the following: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Modified Barthel Index, Berg Balance Scale, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, and the incidence of pneumonia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Breathing Exercise","Pneumonia","Respiration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation program, which consisted of joint range of motion exercises, muscle strengthening, gait training, fine motor exercises, and activity of daily living training.
