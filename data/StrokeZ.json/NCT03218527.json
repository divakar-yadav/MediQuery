Atherosclerosis, responsible for the 20% of ischemic strokes, is characterized by lipid accumulation in the artery wall that leads to chronic inflammation, cell proliferation and ultimately to vessel stenosis. One of the main features related to plaque progression and vulnerability is inflammation. Positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucos (18-FDG PET) allows an accurate quantification of plaque inflammation and it has been proved its usefulness in predicting early stroke recurrences. The investigators aim to test how modifiable vascular risk factors influence plaque inflammation assessed by 18-FDG PET. In addition, investigators will assess the association of this inflammation and circulating endothelial progenitor cells"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atherosclerosis","Stroke","Inflammation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) of the internal carotid artery","description":"Inflammation change of the internal carotid artery assessed by the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) obtained with 18FDG-PET scan at one-year follow-up","timeFrame":"Baseline and at one year follow-up"},{"measure":"Change in the Target-to-Background Ratio (TBR) of the internal carotid artery","description":"Inflammation change of the internal carotid artery assessed by the Target-to-Background Ratio (TBR) obtained with 18FDG-PET scan at one-year follow-up","timeFrame":"Baseline and at one year follow-up"},{"measure":"Change in the Endothelial Progenitor Cells Count","description":"Change in the Endothelial Progenitor Cells Count by flow cytometry","timeFrame":"Baseline and at one year follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke within 7 days before inclusion\n* At least one atherosclerotic plaque in the internal carotid artery\n* \\>18 years old\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cardioembolic strokes according to TOAST criteria\n* Poor functional outcome (Rankin \\>3) after stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult patients diagnosed of ischemic stroke presenting at least on atherosclerotic plaque in the internal carotid artery ipsilateral to stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Pol Camps-Remom, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34660030907","email":"pcamps@santpau.cat"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Barcelona","zip":"08025","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Pol Camps-Renom, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34660030907","email":"pcamps@santpau.cat"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000050197","term":"Atherosclerosis"},{"id":"D000007249","term":"Inflammation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9983","name":"Inflammation","asFound":"Inflammation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M25878","name":"Atherosclerosis","asFound":"Atherosclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
