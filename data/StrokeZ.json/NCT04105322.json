The items of the scale are scored on a 2-, 3- or 4-point ordinal scale. The total score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum 23 points, higher scores indicate better performance.","timeFrame":"Change of trunk impairment from baseline at the end of 48 hours of each kinesio taping intervention."},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function.","timeFrame":"Change of balance scores from baseline at the end of 48 hours of each kinesio taping intervention."},{"measure":"Five Times Sit to Stand Test","description":"This test reproduces the act of sitting and standing for five repetitions as rapidly as possible.\n\nThe test performance was based on its duration; consequently, the shorter time taken by the patient, the better their functional condition would be.","timeFrame":"Change of functional performance scores from baseline at the end of 48 hours of each kinesio taping intervention."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wii Balance Board","description":"The Basic Balance Test game will be used to assess the person's balance. At the end of this game is the routine evaluation of the device Wii Fit age; The patient's demographic characteristics, body mass index, weight transferred to the right and left foot and the Basic Balance Test will be calculated by the device using the game result. The fact that the resulting age is greater than the actual age of the patient will be considered as an inability to balance.","timeFrame":"Change of balance scores from baseline at the end of 48 hours of each kinesio taping intervention."},{"measure":"Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke","description":"This scale contains 12 items for evaluating balance: 5 items to assess the maintenance of posture and 7 items to evaluate changes in posture. Each Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke item is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, for a maximum total score of 36: on this scale, the higher the score is, the more favourable the balance in stroke patients.","timeFrame":"Change of postural ability from baseline at the end of 48 hours of each kinesio taping intervention."},{"measure":"Patient Satisfaction: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)","description":"It will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS consists of a 10 cm horizontal line. The left end of the line has the number 0 and the right end has the number 10. Number 0 means mad I'm not satisfied at all ken, while number 10 is considered \"very satisfied\". Satisfaction level increases from left to right on the line.","timeFrame":"Change of patient satisfaction at the end of 48 hours of each kinesio taping application."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 30-85 years\n* Duration onset of stroke \\< 1 month Stroke time is between 0-1 months\n* Score of Modified Rankin Scale 0-3\n* Score of Mini Mental Test ≥ 24\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Not volunteering to participate in the study\n* Having another stroke history\n* Having a history of fracture or surgical operation involving the lower extremity\n* Have another neurological or orthopedic disorder affecting functionality\n* Having visual or hearing problems\n* Presence of skin lesions (decubitus ulcer, active infection, burns, malignancy, cellulite, scar, etc.) at the site of application.\n* Allergic reaction to kinesio tape\n* Being obese","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Asalet Aybüke GÜP, Bachelor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"553 311 4049","phoneExt":"+90","email":"asalet.a@hotmail.com"},{"name":"Banu BAYAR, Doctorate","role":"CONTACT","phone":"252 211 3201","phoneExt":"+90","email":"bbayar@mu.edu.tr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Asalet Aybüke GÜP, Bachelor","affiliation":"Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Banu BAYAR, Doctorate","affiliation":"Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"27630439","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Lee YJ, Kim JY, Kim SY, Kim KH.
