AIS is a a leading cause of long-term disability and the third-leading cause of mortality. Effective therapies exist to ameliorate the disability associated with AIS, but implementation of these therapies is time-sensitive. Currently, there is a shortage in health care professionals with expertise in the treatment of stroke and such expertise tends to be concentrated in large community-based or academic medical centers. To respond to this shortage, stroke networks are being organized in a \"hub-and-spoke\" model to facilitate the rapid delivery of time-sensitive interventions such as intravenous (i.v.) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or rapid evaluation for AIS. Some networks are also using telemedicine to facilitate this approach and bring the needed expertise via robotic tele-presence (RTP). Though the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and i.v. tPA utilization may be higher in RTP based networks, the impact of this model on patient's outcomes has been difficult to elucidate. To this end, meaningful validated outcome assessments are crucial to understand the impact of stroke interventions including telemedicine or RTP based networks. The objective of this study is to translate evidence-based practice of healthcare, patient-centered outcome assessments, and patient-family perceptions of delivery of care into meaningful data. This will aid in the validation of the role of interventions such as \"hub-and-spoke\" RTP based models in stroke care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic","tPA","tele-medicine","robot","tele-stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exposed","description":"AIS patients evaluated through RTP and who receive i.v. tPA","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase"]},{"label":"Un-exposed","description":"AIS patients evaluated through RTP and who do not receive i.v. tPA"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase","description":"Intravenous (i.v.) tPA per the standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Exposed"],"otherNames":["Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"HRQoL","description":"Health Related Quality of Life","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS","description":"Modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke (AIS)\n* Age \\>17 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hemorrhagic strokes (ICH or SAH)\n* Transient ischemic attacks (TIA)\n* Trauma\n* Inability to obtain informed consent\n* Participation in another study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"This research will be performed only in AIS patients who are routinely admitted to our \"Hub\" and participating \"spoke\" centers.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"19107","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"James P Murphy","role":"CONTACT","phone":"215-503-5739","email":"James.P.Murphy@jefferson.edu"},{"name":"Fred Rincon, MD, MSc","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.95233,"lon":-75.16379}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Related Info","url":"http://www.neurocrit.org/?page_id=88"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","asFound":"Quality of Life","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010959","term":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator"},{"id":"D000010958","term":"Plasminogen"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000005343","term":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"id":"D000050299","term":"Fibrin Modulating Agents"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13539","name":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","asFound":"R-CHOP","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13538","name":"Plasminogen","asFound":"Health-related Quality of Life","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M8163","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
