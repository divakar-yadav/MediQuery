This procedure is performed for periods that avoid physical injury to the limbs, but induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. These changes often result in improved blood supply to various areas of the body. The use of RIC in the acute period after stroke is currently being investigated in a number of large randomised controlled trials e.g. RECAST, RESIST, however, our understanding of how RIC actually works is incomplete. Importantly, there is scarce data on the acute effects of RIC on cerebral blood flow (CBF), a potentially pivotal mechanism behind its effects.\n\nWe propose an exploratory study to evaluate whether it is feasible, acceptable and safe to undertake low and moderate intensity aerobic exercise or remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) in patients during the acute period after stroke, and whether either of these interventions result in changes to cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the major cerebral arteries. We will compare any changes to those in a cohort of healthy volunteers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: Exercise Procedure"]},{"label":"Remote Ischaemic Conditioning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: Remote Ischaemic Conditioning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Exercise Procedure","description":"Patients will undergo 30 minutes of light-moderate intensity leg cycling, using the Letto-2 (Motomed, UK) in the semi-supine position.","armGroupLabels":["Exercise"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Remote Ischaemic Conditioning","description":"Patients will undergo 4 cycles of upper limb RIC using a blood pressure cuff.
