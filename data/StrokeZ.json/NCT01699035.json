Critical elements are queried in areas of finances, stroke impairments, interpersonal support, therapeutic support, organization influences, work or job specific issues and psychological issues.","detailedDescription":"The objective of this project is to more accurately describe the stroke survivor's perspective on return to work. The survey development included qualitative analysis of a set of interviews with stroke survivors to arrive at the critical elements described above, followed by item development with an expert panel and preliminary testing of the wording and format for legibility. The survey is being administered both on-line and by paper through the mail to a wide range of survivors with the objective of obtaining a large, diverse sample. The ultimate goal of the project is to arrive at a refined set of recommendations to inform stroke survivors, health care professionals and employers to increase their sensitivity to the needs and desires of individual attempting to return to work after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","work","vocational rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":715,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke survivors","description":"stroke survivors who have either returned to work, have thought about returning to work, or have tried to return to work"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"critical factors that facilitate or inhibit return to work after stroke","description":"38 multiple choice items that assess psychological factors important to return to work, financial incentives and disincentives, the role of stroke impairments, interpersonal supports that facilitate and inhibit return, the role of therapeutic support especially vocational rehabilitation, organizational influences, and work specific issues that impact on return.
