Its imperative for the physician to fully understand the severity of this complication in order to perform an early diagnosis and carry out the appropriate treatment.\n\nAim:\n\nInvestigate the correlation between echocardiographic measurements and hemodynamic changes at different time points in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery\n\nHypothesis:\n\n1. Weak correlation between echocardiographic measurements and hemodynamic changes during coronary artery bypass graft surgery\n2. Echocardiographic measurements would change across different time points during surgery independent of hemodynamic values."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Right Ventricular Dysfunction","Stroke Volume Index","Longitudinal Heart Strain"],"keywords":["Echocardiography","Coronary artery bypass graft","Thermodilution"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of right ventricular function during CABG assessed by right heart strain (%)","description":"Assessing the change of RV function during CABG surgery using right heart strain as a percentage of change between RV shortening and RV end diastolic length.","timeFrame":"during CABG surgery"},{"measure":"Change of right ventricular function during CABG assessed by stroke volume index (mL/m2)","description":"Assessing the change of RV function during CABG surgery using stroke volume index.
