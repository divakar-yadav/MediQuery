Among institutions involved in this case study, the latest devices are readily available and fully support standard treatment paradigms.\n\nHowever, several cases, recently completed, using only large bore catheter and aspiration have anecdotally demonstrated a superior ability to remove clot from vessels, restoring blood flow to the affected vessel and brain tissue. In these limited number of cases, full restoration of blood flow has been achieved. While this combination of approved devices is minimalistic, the efficiency of the procedure, rapid technical success, and relative simplicity of the approach is unique and should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly prepared for publication."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Technique"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Discharge national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS)","description":"a national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) will be obtained at the time of the each patient's discharge or approximately 7 days","timeFrame":"approximately 7 days after index stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"90 day modified Rankin Score (mRS)","description":"90 days after procedure each patient's modified Rankin Score will be obtained.","timeFrame":"90 days after procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients who were treated with direct aspiration as a first pass choice or treated with a stent retriever will be included.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients not treated with either direct aspiration as a first pass, or stent retriever will not be included.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"This is a chart review of clinical data for patients who have been treated for stroke with either direct aspiration or stent retrievers.
