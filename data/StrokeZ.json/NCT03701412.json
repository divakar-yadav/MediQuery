Clinical studies have found strong associations between CMBs and chronic hypertension and low cholesterol levels and between the proximity and volume of CMBs and those of subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) . studies have found that CMBs are linked to subsequent hemorrhagic stroke in stroke survivors,and suggested that CMBs are related to antithrombotic-related hemorrhage.\n\nClinical implications of cerebral microbleeds The increased of cerebral hemorrhage associated with the presence of CMBs may allow prediction of hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke. An earlier report suggested that hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis was associated with the presence of CMBs.\n\nConsiderable interest also exists in utilizing detection of CMBs to estimate the risks of hemorrhagic complications in patients on antithrombotic treatment. , CMBs were found to be more frequent and extensive in patients with double antiplatelets-associated ICH."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"MRI","description":"MRI brain"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"analyse Risk factors responsible for development of cerebral micro bleeds.","description":"All patients will undergo T2\\*-weighted or gradient-echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of micro bleeds","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients diagnosed as ischemic CVS or Transient ischemic attack admitted to Assuit University Hospital or visiting outpatient clinic.\n* Old stroke patients on double antiplatelet therapy for duration more than 3 months\n* old stroke patients on anticoagulants.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with blood diseases hepatic and renal patient.
