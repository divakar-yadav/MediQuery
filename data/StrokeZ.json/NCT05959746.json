The aim is to optimize management through early diagnosis (self- and hetero-diagnosis) and thus to reduce sequelae disability.\n\nThe study authors hypothesize that some stroke patients will be able to successfully perform a self-test consisting of a few exercises dictated by an application on a smartphone or tablet and recorded on video."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Cerebrovascular"],"keywords":["Artificial Intelligence","Data bank","Video recording"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with suspected acute stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: AI-STROKE application"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"AI-STROKE application","description":"Complete neurological exam of stroke patients will be filmed by healthcare workers and themselves using the AI-STROKE application","armGroupLabels":["Patients with suspected acute stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Usable video recording made by the patient","description":"Recording using AI-STROKE application","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Usable video recording made by the hospital worker","description":"Recording using AI-STROKE application","timeFrame":"Day 0"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Usable video recording made by the patient","description":"Recording using AI-STROKE application","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Usable video recording made by the hospital worker","description":"Recording using AI-STROKE application","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Feasibility of patient self-recording","description":"Patient able to record without assistance: yes/no","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Feasibility of patient self-recording","description":"Patient able to record without assistance: yes/no","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Acceptability of self-recording by patients","description":"Patient accepting to self-record: Yes/no","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Patient-reported ease of self-recording","description":"Visual numerical scale 0-10","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Patient-reported ease of self-recording","description":"Visual numerical scale 0-10","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Stroke severity","description":"NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) score assessed by neurologist","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Stroke severity","description":"NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) score assessed by neurologist","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Degree of disability following stroke","description":"mRS (modified Rankin Scale) score, range 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe handicap) administered by the neurologist","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Degree of disability following stroke","description":"mRS (modified Rankin Scale) score, range 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe handicap) administered by the neurologist","timeFrame":"Month 3"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients treated in the emergency department or hospitalized in the NICU at the CHU de Nîmes for suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack in the acute phase (\\<72h), with or without motor deficit\n* Patient to be seen again in consultation within 4 months\n* Patient has given free and informed consent and signed the consent form.
