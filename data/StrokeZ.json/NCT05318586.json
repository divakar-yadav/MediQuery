The brain has plasticity, and makes adaptive changes after stroke, resulting in the reorganization and compensation of neural networks. However, the muscle tone of some patients will significantly increase during the recovery process, which affects the rehabilitation effect. Neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been widely used to promote brain network remodeling after stroke. The investigators attempted to evaluate the motor brain network characteristics of spastic patients by fNIRS, and used the most active brain regions as rTMS stimulation regions to evaluate the improvement effect of this individualized treatment on post-stroke spasticity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity, Muscle","Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Spasticity, Muscle","Rehabilitation","fNIRS","rTMS","Activation","Brain network"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Individualized rTMS based on fNIRS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Low-frequency rTMS will be given to the most active brain regions assessed by fNIRS.","interventionNames":["Procedure: individual rTMS based on fNIRS"]},{"label":"Traditional rTMS strategy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will always be given low-frequency rTMS to contralesional M1","interventionNames":["Procedure: Traditional rTMS strategy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"individual rTMS based on fNIRS","description":"The rTMS parameters will be set according to fNIRS results.","armGroupLabels":["Individualized rTMS based on fNIRS"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Traditional rTMS strategy","description":"The low-frequency rTMS to contralesional M1 will always be used.","armGroupLabels":["Traditional rTMS strategy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Ashworth scale","description":"The range is 0-â…£ level, the higher the level, the higher the spasticity.","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment of upper limb motor function","description":"The score range is 0-66 points, the higher the score, the better the motor function of upper limb.","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"The score range is 0-100 points, the higher the score, the better the activities of daily living.","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"average weighted clustering coefficient","description":"This is a brain network indicator based on graph theory.
