The outcomes of patients with severe stroke depend largely on medical strategies on acute stage, especially on blood pressure (BP) management. Unfortunately, so far no ideal BP range has been scientifically determined for patients with acute severe stroke.\n\nThe CHASE study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of individualized anti-hypertension strategy in patients with acute severe stroke (target recruitment 250) compared to standard guideline-based management of BP (target recruitment 250). Patients presenting with acute (\\<72h) severe stroke (GCS ≦ 12 or NIHSS ≧ 11) and elevated BP (systolic blood pressure ≧150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≧ 100 mmHg) will be randomly assigned to individualized anti-hypertension treatment or guideline-based treatment for 7 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Stroke","Acute Stroke","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Severe Stroke","Acute Stroke","Antihypertension","mortality","disability","clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Individualized BP lowering","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Management policy is to lower the systolic or diastolic BP by 10-15% within 2 hours of randomization and sustained for 7 days.
