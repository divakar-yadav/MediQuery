The aim of the study is to examine the difference in the treatment effects among the combination of task-oriented training with either augmented reality based mirror therapy, mirror therapy or traditional occupational therapy on the upper extremity function and brain activity of the stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Technology","Mirror Movement Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Traditional occupational therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Traditional occupational therapy delivered skill training related to daily living tasks.","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional occupational therapy"]},{"label":"Mirror therapy using a mirror box","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Exercise of mirror therapy included movements of forearm, wrist, fingers and thumb, as well as a tendon gliding exercise using a mirror box .","interventionNames":["Other: Mirror therapy using a mirror box"]},{"label":"Augmented reality-based mirror therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise of augmented reality-based mirror therapy included movements of forearm, wrist, fingers and thumb, as well as a tendon gliding exercise using an augmented reality mirror therapy system\n\n.","interventionNames":["Other: Augmented reality-based mirror therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Traditional occupational therapy","description":"Motor training targeted to goals that are relevant to the functional needs of the patient","armGroupLabels":["Traditional occupational therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mirror therapy using a mirror box","description":"Mirror therapy using a mirror box","armGroupLabels":["Mirror therapy using a mirror box"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Augmented reality-based mirror therapy","description":"Augmented reality-based mirror therapy","armGroupLabels":["Augmented reality-based mirror therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the result of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for motor function of upper extremity test","description":"Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed).

The grading of the scale is described as below: 0) no increase in muscle tone; 1) minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion; 1+) slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the reminder (less than half) of the ROM; 2) more marked increase in tone but only after part is easily flexed; 3) considerable increase in tone; and 4) passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension.","timeFrame":"baseline, 9 weeks and 21 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in the result of Box and blocks test","description":"The score is the number of blocks carried from one box to the other in one minute.
