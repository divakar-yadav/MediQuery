The Halo Alert System consists of an EEG sensor headband and is paired with a data transfer device. Approximately 300 subjects with elevated stroke risk will be enrolled and followed for a duration of 90 days. The EEG tracing for each study subject will be labeled after study conclusion with the help of clinically available information on the occurrence of a recurrent stroke. The labeled data will then be used to further develop the existing (operating room based) stroke detection algorithm and adjust the algorithm for outpatient use."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Stroke"],"keywords":["reoccurring","detection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Halo Alert System","description":"The Halo Alert System consists of an EEG sensor headband and is paired with a data transfer device."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of Halo Alert System to collect EEG data for algorithm development","description":"Subject's data collection with the Halo Alert System to assess the feasibility of EEG based stroke detection at home for algorithm development.","timeFrame":"12 months enrollment period"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
