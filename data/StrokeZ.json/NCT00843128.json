Inclusion criteria are chronic or secondary progressive MS patients with EDSS between 5.5-7, stable treatment 3 months before study entry, without generalized diseases. All patients will sign an informed consent. Following randomization, 20 patients will be treated with RAGT, 12 sessions over three weeks. The control group will be treated by CWT, 12 sessions in three weeks. The primary outcome measures will be the Functional Ambulatory Capacity (FAC) scale and the 6-minutes walking distance. The secondary outcome measures will be the Time up \\& Go (TUG) test, 10 Meter Walking test, Berg balance test, EDSS score, FIM score and RAND questioner for quality of life. All tests will be performed by an external blinded assessor at baseline, after three weeks, and at follow-up after 3 months and six months.\n\nImportance: We anticipated that Robot-assisted gait training will be found as feasible and may be an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking disabilities."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1: RAGT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Following randomization, 20 patients will be treated with RAGT, 12 sessions over three weeks","interventionNames":["Device: robot-assisted gait training (RAGT)"]},{"label":"2: Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will be treated by CWT, 12 sessions in three weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: conventional walking training (CWT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"robot-assisted gait training (RAGT)","description":"20 patients will be treated with RAGT, 12 sessions over three weeks.","armGroupLabels":["1: RAGT"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"conventional walking training (CWT)","description":"The control group will be treated by CWT, 12 sessions in three weeks.","armGroupLabels":["2: Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulatory Capacity (FAC) scale and the 6-minutes walking distance","timeFrame":"At baseline, after three weeks, and at follow-up after 3 months and six months."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time up & Go (TUG) test, 10 Meter Walking test, Berg balance test, EDSS score, FIM score and SF36 questioner for quality of life.","timeFrame":"At baseline, after three weeks, and at follow-up after 3 months and six months."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. chronic or secondary progressive MS patients with EDSS between 5.5-7,\n2. stable treatment 3 months before study entry.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
