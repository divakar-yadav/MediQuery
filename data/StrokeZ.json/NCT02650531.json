In addition to motor impairments and comorbidities, disability after stroke is often related to post stroke dementia (PSD) or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD). However, these problems are hardly addressed in stroke or dementia research and frequently ignored in clinical practise. In the Nor-COAST study an interdisciplinary research group will collaborate to establish a research platform across all Norwegian Health Authorities. The overall aim of the study is to improve competence on PSD and NCD in order to improve individual health outcomes following a stroke. The specific objectives are to determine the incidence of PSD and NCD and the consequences on function and use of health care services and to enhance the early detection of PSD and NCD by identifying a set of risk factors, ranging from genetics to physical activity. The incidence and impact of PSD and NCD on function and use of health care services, medication and life-style changes are important when planning future health care services. Tools identifying patients at risk might improve diagnostic work up and together with knowledge on pathogenic aspects it will contribute to future treatment and prevention of PSD and NCD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dementia","Mild Cognitive Impairment","Stroke"],"keywords":["Follow up studies","Risk factors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":816,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Score on the Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA)","description":"Performance based test","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Score on the Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA)","description":"Performance based test","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Time spent in upright position","description":"measured by bodyworn sensors","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Time spent in upright position","description":"measured by bodyworn sensors","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Brain Imaging","description":"MRI","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Score on Short Physical Performance Battery (sppb)","description":"Performance based test for mobility and lower extremity function","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Score on Short Physical Performance Battery (sppb)","description":"Physical function by performance based tests","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Selfreported habits concerning smoking, alcohol, diet and medication using standardised questionnaires","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Selfreported habits concerning smoking, alcohol, diet and medication using standardised questionnaires","timeFrame":"18 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke diagnosis according to the WHO criteria\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Not scandinavian speaking","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with acute stroke","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Lars Jacob Stovner, md prof","affiliation":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology","city":"Trondheim","zip":"7006","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":63.43049,"lon":10.39506}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"30477436","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Thingstad P, Askim T, Beyer MK, Brathen G, Ellekjaer H, Ihle-Hansen H, Knapskog AB, Lydersen S, Munthe-Kaas R, Naess H, Pendlebury ST, Seljeseth YM, Saltvedt I.
