Approximately 500,000 people in the United States experience this type of stroke each year. The only approved treatment for acute stroke is to attempt to dissolve the blood clot using t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator). This treatment must be given within 3 hours of symptom onset and is associated with a risk of brain hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) of about 6% (6 in 100 patients).\n\nActivated Protein C (APC) is a protein in the blood that is important in dissolving blood clots and reducing inflammation. Studies in animals suggest that APC may also protect brain cells from injury caused by a stroke. We are doing this study to determine if giving APC to individuals who have had a stroke will be safe and will reduce the damage to brain cells caused by the stroke. APC is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with severe, life-threatening infections."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tier One","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive APC by intravenous injection, receiving 50% of dose as a bolus and the remainder as an infusion over one ho.","interventionNames":["Drug: Activated Protein C"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Activated Protein C","description":"Intravenous APC (10, 15, 22, 33, 50, and 75 mcg/kg) administered to patients with acute ischemic stroke within 0 - 9 hours of symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["Tier One"],"otherNames":["Xigris"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Intracranial Hemorrhage","description":"Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH):\n\nFatal ICH: Death ascribed to ICH confirmed by autopsy or CT imaging.
