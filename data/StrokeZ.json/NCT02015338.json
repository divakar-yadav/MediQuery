In children with hemiparesis, however, those two locations will diverge. The prediction is that TMS will best guide Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) interventions","detailedDescription":"Congenital hemiparesis, mainly due to stroke, affects approximately 25% of children with cerebral palsy. Noninvasive brain stimulation has emerged to influence improvements in hand function specifically in children with congenital hemiparesis due to stroke.\n\nThe use of one type of noninvasive brain stimulation, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with rehabilitation training intervention for a child with hemiparesis proposes a synergistic approach to improving hand function. Application of electrodes over certain targeted areas are placed with the intent to stimulate and influence neuronal activity.\n\nOur preliminary evidence suggests that in children with hemiparesis due to stroke, the area for placement is variable as noted by electroencephalogram (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) measurement methods, influencing the site location of optimal stimulation for tDCS.\n\nDue to this variation, the optimal site of stimulation warrants investigation for the optimal placement of tDCS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Congenital Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Hemiparesis","Cerebral Palsy","Congenital Stroke","Congenital Infarct"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":47,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Typically Developing Children","description":"Children with typical development (e.g. no presence of neurological disorders or diagnoses)"},{"label":"Children with Hemiparesis","description":"Children diagnosed with Hemiparesis"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Determine the location of the motor cortex by two different means","description":"Determine the location of the motor cortex through two means: 1) The international 10/20 EEG system of measurement and 2) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) testing of cortical excitability in typically developing children and children with hemiparesis.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of distance in centimeters between the 10/20 EEG C3 or C4 location and the TMS-derived motor hotspot.","description":"Compare the two locations (in each hemisphere) determined by 10/20 EEG system and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) testing and measure in centimeters differences between the two locations.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nTypically Developing Children:\n\n* Ages 8-17\n\nChildren with congenital hemiparesis due to hemispheric stroke:\n\n* Ages 8-17\n* Equal of greater than 10 degrees of active motion at the metacarpophalangeal joint\n* No evidence of seizure activity within the last 2 years.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTypically Developing Children:\n\n* neurologic disorders\n* indwelling metal\n* pregnancy\n* history of seizures\n\nChildren with hemiparesis:\n\n* Metabolic disorders\n* Neoplasm\n* Epilepsy\n* Disorders of cellular migration and proliferation\n* Expressive aphasia\n* Pregnancy\n* Indwelling metal\n* Botulinum toxin or phenol intramuscular block within the one-month preceding TMS application.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"8 Years","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"],"studyPopulation":"Children with congenital hemiparesis and typically developing children","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bernadette T Gillick, PhD, MSPT","affiliation":"University of Minnesota","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Minnesota","city":"Minneapolis","state":"Minnesota","zip":"55455","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":44.97997,"lon":-93.26384}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28530154","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Rich TL, Menk JS, Rudser KD, Chen M, Meekins GD, Pena E, Feyma T, Bawroski K, Bush C, Gillick BT.
