Mostly patient with stroke face many disabilities and the most important one is upper limb motor impairment. For the optimization of upper extremity and prevention of patient from permanent disability it is essential to promotes Neuro-rehabilitation interventions. Physiotherapy techniques need to be monotonous, thorough and task oriented for neuroplasticity to generate better recovery. There is notable enhancement in ADLS when the rehabilitation program starts within 16 hours to 6 months after stroke In improving upper extremity motor functions there are tremendous types of techniques used i.e. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation(PNF),Brunnstorm, Bobath therapy, Motor relearning program(MRP),Constraint induced movement therapy(CIMT) and Mirror therapy(MT).Out of which we are using two basic techniques i.e. motor relearning program(MRP) and mirror therapy(MT).Mirror therapy enhance functional activities in patient with hemiplegic stroke. For betterment of result high quality methodological studies and larger sample size is required. Mirror therapy enhance functional activities in patient with hemiplegic stroke.
