Measurements will occur right after inclusion and repeated once after 7-8 weeks. Upper extremity kinematics and test scores will indicate the influence of additional weight to hand as a possible confounder when, in the future, the hand orthosis would be used as a therapy tool."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Study focusses on within participant comparison and cannot be blinded."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Added weight to hand","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Additional weight at hand"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Additional weight at hand","description":"Added weight of an inactive hand orthosis (300 gram)","armGroupLabels":["Added weight to hand"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test","description":"Score","timeFrame":"0 weeks"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test","description":"Score","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer","description":"Score","timeFrame":"0 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer","description":"Score","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Box and Blocks","description":"Score","timeFrame":"0 weeks"},{"measure":"Box and Blocks","description":"Score","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Upper extremity kinematics","description":"Joint angles","timeFrame":"0 weeks"},{"measure":"Upper extremity kinematics","description":"Joint angles","timeFrame":"8 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Post-stroke\n* Receive regular therapy at Jessa hospital\n* Able to willingly sign informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Relapse during study\n* Secundary complications limiting upper extremity performance","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
