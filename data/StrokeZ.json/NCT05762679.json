Chronic post stroke shoulder pain (PSSP) contributes to depression, interferes with motor recovery, and decreases quality of life. Although PSSP is thought to be caused by damage to the myofascial tissues around the shoulder joint, the pathophysiology of myofascial dysfunction and pain in PSSP has not been elucidated, leading to missed opportunities for early diagnosis, and variable success with pain management. The accumulation of HA in muscle and its fascia can cause myofascial dysfunction. HA is a GAG and a chief constituent of the extracellular matrix of muscle. In physiologic quantities, it functions as a lubricant and a viscoelastic shock absorber, enabling force transmission during muscle contraction and stretch. Reduced joint mobility and spasticity can result in focal accumulation and alteration of HA in muscle, leading to the development of taut bands, dysfunctional gliding of deep fascia and muscle layers, Reduced Range of Motion (ROM), and pain. Muscle HA concentrations can be imaged using T1ρ MRI, and myofascial dysfunction can be assessed using echo texture analysis and shear strain mapping on quantitative US, which may serve as useful biomarkers to elucidate the pathophysiology of myofascial dysfunction in PSSP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myofascial Dysfunction"],"keywords":["Glycosaminoglycan","Hyaluronic acid","Post stroke shoulder pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Latent PSSP","description":"Latent PSSP defined as focal palpable nodules that may be tender on palpation with pain rating of \\< 5/10 when combined with the hand-behind-neck (HBN) maneuver."},{"label":"Active PSSP","description":"Active PSSP is defined as focal palpable nodules that are tender on palpation, reproducing the pain, and eliciting a pain rating of \\>= 5/10 when combined with the hand-behind-neck (HBN) maneuver."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To quantify the extent of HA accumulation in shoulder muscles using quantitative MRI and US.","description":"Comparison of T1rho (T1ρ) MRI of pectoralis major and infraspinatus muscles in paretic and non-paretic shoulders","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"To distinguish between latent versus active PSSP using US shear strain mapping of the same muscles on the paretic side compared with the non-paretic side.","description":"Comparison of peak lateral shear strain of pectoralis major and infraspinatus muscles in paretic latent vs active PSSP compared to non-paretic shoulders","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years or older\n* Hemiparesis from Ischemic or Hemorrhagic Stroke\n* 4-120 months post-stroke with Hemiparesis since the incidence and intensity of PSSP\n* Show a difference of more than 10 degrees of passive ER-ROM between non-paretic and paretic shoulders with or without pain\n* Able to provide informed consent and comply with testing protocols\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Received treatment for spasticity with Botulinum Toxin or Intrathecal Baclofen within the past three months\n* Have another neurologic condition that may affect motor response (e.g. Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS))\n* Have a contraindication to MRI (claustrophobia, magnetic pacemakers and clips)\n* Have non-musculoskeletal PSSP such as only central pain or Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)\n* Have a complicated medical condition, or significant injury to either upper limb.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We will enroll 20 patients each with latent PSSP and active PSSP group, repectively.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Preeti Raghavan, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"410-955-0703","email":"praghav3@jh.edu"},{"name":"Jonny Huang, DPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(410) 614-1347","email":"jhuan190@jh.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Preeti Raghavan, MD","affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21287","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Jonny Huang, DPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"410-614-1347","email":"jhuan190@jh.edu"},{"name":"Preeti Raghavan, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21597","name":"Shoulder Pain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12756","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9568","name":"Hyaluronic Acid","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
