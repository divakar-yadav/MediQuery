Patients who were eligible to the inclusion criteria and ineligible to the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into two groups by a 1:1 ratio. Patients in one arm will receive colchicine initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg per day during on days 1 through 14. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization and at discharge. The outcomes were stroke, neurological deterioration, сombined endpoint events (stroke, myocardial infarction and death), bleeding during 14 days of follow-up in an intention-to treat analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","low-dose colchicine","clopidogrel"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Colchicine Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All patients in this arm will receive colchicine for 14 days in addition to standard medical care without clopidogrel (acetylsalicylic acid, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, gastroprotective, hypoglycemic drugs if necessary, lifestyle recommendations, early rehabilitation activities).","interventionNames":["Drug: Colchicine"]},{"label":"Clopidogrel treatment group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"All patients in this arm will receive standard treatment including clopidogrel.","interventionNames":["Drug: Clopidogrel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Colchicine","description":"Oral colchicine will be initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg per day during 14 days.
