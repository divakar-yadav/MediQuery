This project proposes to test the efficacy of a form of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy designed for patients with such severe impairment in conjunction with an agent, fluoxetine, which has been shown in some studies to enhance brain neuroplasticity in response to training. Constraint-Induced Movement therapy, which is abbreviated CIMT, is a form of physical rehabilitation based on basic research in neuroscience and behavioral science. If the project is successful, an efficacious, evidence-based therapy will become available to stroke patients for what is now a largely untreated condition"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Stroke With Affected Arm Motor Function"],"keywords":["stroke","Fluoxetine (FLX)","eCIMT","Central Nervous System"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"eCMIT and Fluoxetine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"expanded form of Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (eCIMT) combined with Fluoxetine (FLX)","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoxetine","Procedure: eCMIT"]},{"label":"eCIMT and placebo","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"expanded form of Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (eCIMT) combined with placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoxetine","Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Usual care and fluoxetine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ususal physical care combined with Fluoxetine (FLX)","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoxetine","Procedure: Usual Care"]},{"label":"Usual care and placebo","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Usual physical care combined with placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo","Procedure: Usual Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fluoxetine","armGroupLabels":["Usual care and fluoxetine","eCIMT and placebo","eCMIT and Fluoxetine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Usual care and placebo","eCIMT and placebo"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"eCMIT","armGroupLabels":["eCMIT and Fluoxetine"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Usual Care","armGroupLabels":["Usual care and fluoxetine","Usual care and placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Grade 4/5 Motor Activity Log (MAL) Arm Use Scale","description":"This is a structured interview.
