LF-rTMS group: H 4 Coil (stimulation site: prefrontal cortex, insular lobe),1-Hz rTMS, stimulation intensity RMT 100%,1200 pulses/session, two sessions (2400 pulses)/day (interval ≥2 hours), lasting about half an hour each time, the total duration of treatment was 3 days (6 sessions,7200 pulses).\n2. Control group: received routine treatment.\n\nAll the above therapeutic interventions were conducted by trained TMS operators. Except for the study intervention, the subjects in both groups received clinical routine diagnosis and treatment which were not affected by the intervention.\n\nAll patients were followed up until the 90th day after randomization to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of LF-rTMS in reducing infarct size, reducing disability rate and improving functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours after stroke onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","LF-rTMS","Phase 2 Pilot Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The investigators involved in the clinical evaluation of the patients remained blinded to treatment grouping.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LF-rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"H 4 Coil (stimulation site: prefrontal cortex, insular lobe),1-Hz rTMS, stimulation intensity RMT 100%,1200 pulses/session, two sessions (2400 pulses)/day (interval ≥2 hours), lasting about half an hour each time, the total duration of treatment was 3 days (6 sessions,7200 pulses).","interventionNames":["Device: LF-rTMS"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Routine treatment."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"LF-rTMS","description":"H 4 Coil (stimulation site: prefrontal cortex, insular lobe),1-Hz rTMS, stimulation intensity RMT 100%,1200 pulses/session, two sessions (2400 pulses)/day (interval ≥2 hours), lasting about half an hour each time, the total duration of treatment was 3 days (6 sessions,7200 pulses).","armGroupLabels":["LF-rTMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Infarct growth","description":"Infarct growth at 3 days was calculated as the absolute difference between the baseline core infarct volume and the 3 days post-randomization infarct volume.","timeFrame":"3 days"},{"measure":"Proportion of Early neurological improvement (ENI)","description":"Proportion of patients with a reduction of ≥4 on the NIHSS, compared with the baseline score or an NIHSS of 0 or 1","timeFrame":"3 days"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"The proportion of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","timeFrame":"3 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Final infarct volume","description":"Final infarct volume","timeFrame":"3 days"},{"measure":"△NIHSS score","description":"Change in NIHSS score from baseline","timeFrame":"3 days"},{"measure":"mRS scores of 0-1","description":"Proportion of patients with mRS scores of 0-1","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"mRS scores of 0-2","description":"Proportion of patients with mRS scores of 0-2","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Barthel index of ADL","description":"Barthel index of ADL, 0-100 (better)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"EQ-5D-5L","description":"The Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) is a self-report survey that measures quality of life across 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.
