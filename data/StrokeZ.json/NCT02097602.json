An increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and the fraction of RP have been shown to be correlated to cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. However, there are no trials so far investigating how surgery impacts the fraction of RP and how this fraction correlates with the outcome after noncardiac surgery.\n\nPatients with an age above 18 years undergoing high-risk or intermediate-risk noncardiac surgery are to be included. The fraction of RP is to be investigated in routinely acquired blood samples preoperatively, postoperatively in the recovery room, as well as 24-72 hours after anaesthesia and surgery.\n\nA primary common endpoint are major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), as well as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. MACCEs are defined according to Sabaté et al. as: cardiac death, cerebrovascular death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, new cardiac arrhythmia, angina or stroke. Secondary endpoints are lengths of hospital stay and intensive care stay as well as mortality after 3 months. All participants are to be contacted by phone three months after discharge and their health situation is to be determined.\n\n1000 patients will be enrolled in a defined time frame of six months"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Death","Congestive Heart Failure","Angina Pectoris","Stroke","Pulmonary Embolism","Deep Vein Thrombosis"],"keywords":["Reticulated platelets","noncardiac surgery","MACCEs","major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events","outcome","High-risk or intermediate-risk noncardiac surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs)","description":"MACCEs are defined according to Sabaté et al. as: cardiac death, cerebrovascular death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, new cardiac arrhythmia, angina or stroke.
