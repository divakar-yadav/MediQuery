Subjects will have experienced a stroke within 3 months of enrollment and will be undergoing inpatient rehabilitation at Penn Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine. Neuropsychological testing will be repeated immediately after completion of stimulation and 3-, 12- and 24- months following completion of treatment. The investigators will examine changes in cognitive performance induced by tDCS + cognitive therapy compared to sham tDCS + cognitive therapy. This study will combine knowledge gained from our behavioral, clinical and sociodemographic data in order to determine the relative degrees to which these properties predict whether persons with post-stroke cognitive impairment will respond to intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["post-stroke cognitive impairment","transcranial direct current stimulation","neurorehabiliation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) + cognitive therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will undergo 5 daily sessions of tDCS for 20 minutes using a montage in which an anode (2 mA) is placed over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode will be place on the right supraorbital area.
