The consequences of stroke on patients can lead to a financial and welfare burden on society. Thus, it is vital to provide a rehabilitation program to enhance patients' performance in ADLs and help them become more independent. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation on stroke patients' capability to perform ADLs after three months of telerehabilitation intervention. Additionally, we also conducted a survey on the satisfaction of patients after telerehabilitation. We conducted our study by organizing 32 stroke patients from five hospitals in Vietnam. All subjects were provided the three-month treatment that included video-based rehabilitation and the online meeting section. We employed the Barthel Index (BI) to evaluate the intervention and used the Paired T-test to review the results. Evaluation of the satisfaction of stroke patients with telerehabilitation by Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire (TSUQ)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute, Telerehabilitation"],"keywords":["stroke, telerehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"The telerehabilitation program for stroke patients is provided via a remote system with caregiver support during 3 months","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Outcomes Assessor will be randomly assigned to online interview the patient and caregiver (this person does not know and have previously treated the patient)"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"telerehabilitation for stroke patient","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Telerehabilitation for stroke patient"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Telerehabilitation for stroke patient","description":"The subjects of the study were intervened by telerehabilitation through video instructions and online group training via Online meeting software.
