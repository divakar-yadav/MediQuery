In order to make this phase of the study more robust and to reduce bias on image assessment we will prospectively randomize the patients in a 2:1 fashion to either direct to angio for CB-CT imaging or MD-CT imaging in the emergency room. A total of 60 CB-CT subjects and 30 MD-CT subjects will comprise this cohort. Entrance criteria will be identical to those in Phase 1, except the NIHSS must be greater than 8 which is clinically correlative with a likely large vessel occlusion and, since this is standard of care imaging for acute ischemic stroke, GFR will be removed as an exclusionary criteria.\n\nThe Phase 1 of this research was registered to NCT03232151."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Single center, randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"C-ARM CBCT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A C-arm CBCT evaluation with SMART RECON novel software for the rapid assessment of time-resolved CT angiogram and CT perfusion.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: C-Arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography"]},{"label":"MD-CT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"An evaluation with conventional, standard of care, multi-detector CT (MD-CT)","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Multi-detector Computed Tomography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"C-Arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography","description":"C-ARM CBCT angiogram and CBCT perfusion imaging using prototype software (SMART-RECON) can rapidly and accurately assess the cerebral blood flow maps in the setting of decreased blood flow to the brain (ischemic cerebrovascular events).
