It is one of the developments related to bleeding as a result of occlusion of blood vessels in the brain with a clot or damage from the vessels.Loss of strength and motor coordination in the lower and upper extremities is the main cause of disability after stroke. Activities such as walking, standing, sitting and daily activities such as dressing, bathing and toilet are frequently affected and sensorimotor disorders are common.\n\nFunctional electrical stimulation (FES) is one of the methods used in treatment. FES provides muscle contraction and movement by electrical stimulation of motor neurons. It is applied by a controller through skin electrodes to induce contractions. The FES-evoked bike allows people with or without voluntary leg movement to pedal an exercise bike on a fixed system.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aimed to compare the treatment efficacy and changes in muscle characteristics of conservative treatment and cycling FES in stroke patients.\n\nDemographic data of the patients and healthy volunteers will be recorded. Hemiplegic patients will be evaluated in terms of Barthel Index, Modified Ashworth Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Ambulation Scale, Brunnstrom's Hemiplegia Recovery Stage, Fatigue Severity Scale, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, 6-Minute Walking Test, Muscle strength measurement, pennation angle and thickness measurement of the musculus rectus femoris muscle"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conservative Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conservative Rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Conservative rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Cycling Functional Electrical Stimulation in addition to Conservative Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cycling Functional Electrical Stimulation in addition to Conservative Rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Conservative rehabilitation","Other: Cycling Functional Electrical Stimulation in addition to Conservative Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conservative rehabilitation","description":"Joint range of motion, strengthening, balance-coordination and stretching exercises included in the conservative physiotherapy program 5 days a week for a total of 6 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Conservative Rehabilitation","Cycling Functional Electrical Stimulation in addition to Conservative Rehabilitation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cycling Functional Electrical Stimulation in addition to Conservative Rehabilitation","description":"In addition to conservative treatment, cycling FES to the affected lower extremity for 20 minutes, 3 days a week for 4 weeks.
