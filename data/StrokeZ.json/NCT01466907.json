Referral was sent to a physician if medical interventions were needed regarding risk factors measured above the limits as stated in the follow-up protocol in accordance with guidelines,and/or if any self-reported health problems were stated by the patients, or had been detected by the Specialist Nurse. Primary outcome was comparison between the intervention group and control group at one year after stroke regarding proportion of regulated risk factors, and self-reports on health outcome. Results of the two follow-ups of the intervention group were also compared."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["complication","depression","follow-up","intervention","nurse-led","outcome","secondary prevention","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":597,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control of secondary prevention at three months and one year after stroke and referral to physician if medical interventions are needed.
