We recruit these patients who received stem cell therapy and completed the study. We adopted movement-related cortical potential,and cortico-cortical inhibition to assess the stroke patients with or without stem cell therapy. Further analyzing the correlation of the motor related cortical potential and cortico-cortical inhibition among them. We wanted to find out if there are changes in cortical excitability in subjects with chronic stroke after stem cell therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["changes in cortical excitability in subjects with chronic stroke after stem cell therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normal control"},{"label":"with Stem cell therapy plus G-CSF"},{"label":"G-CSF along"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.old cerebral infarction (middle cerebral artery territory as documented on the T2 weight image \\[T2WI\\] of MRI) 2.between 6 months and 5 years of onset 3.National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) of between 9 and 20.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.Seizure history 2.
