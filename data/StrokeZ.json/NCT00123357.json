Based on American Heart Association ratios of stroke incidence and prevalence, up to 80,000 veterans may be stroke survivors. The assessment of outcomes in stroke survivors is important for clinical practice and research, yet there is no consensus on the best measures of stroke outcome in either clinical practice or research. We have developed a new stroke-specific outcome measure, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), to capture physical function and other dimensions of health-related quality of life.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe major research questions in this investigation are: 1) Does the SIS have concurrent and discriminate validity in a veteran stroke population when compared to the FIM, Rankin, and the SF-36V? 2) What effect does mode of administration have on response rates, bias, data quality, reliability and validity, SIS domain scores, and cost of data collection? 3) What factors differentiate responders and non-responders? 4) Will the SIS scores predict health care costs and utilization?\n\nMethods:\n\nUsing ICD-9 discharge codes and electronic medical records, patients were screened for a valid diagnosis of stroke. At three months post-stroke, patients were randomly assigned to receive a mailed SIS instrument or SIS via telephone interview. At four months post-stroke, all respondents were evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure and SF-36V by telephone.\n\nStatus:\n\nCompleted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Quality of Life","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":800,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nNo exclusion criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nNo exclusion criteria.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Dean M.
