However, it leads to a sudden reperfusion of the brain parenchyma associated to an extension of the infarct volume. Evidence has indicated that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces final infarct size in animal stroke models. The main objective of the present study is to determine whether remote ischemic conditioning can limit the final infarct volume after recanalization of the occluded cerebral artery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Mechanical Thrombectomy","Ischemia/Reperfusion","Remote Ischemic Conditioning","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) positive","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with remote ischemic conditioning","interventionNames":["Device: Remote ischemic conditioning"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will receive a sham procedure (same procedure than Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) with brachial cuff inflation to 30 millimeters (mm) of mercury (Hg) during 40 minutes).","interventionNames":["Device: Patients with a sham procedure of remote ischemic conditioning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Remote ischemic conditioning","description":"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC): Four cycles of \\[5 minutes of brachial cuff inflation at 200 millimeters (mm) of mercury (Hg) followed by 5 minutes of cuff deflation\\] started as soon as possible after Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).","armGroupLabels":["Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) positive"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Patients with a sham procedure of remote ischemic conditioning","description":"Sham procedure: Four cycles of \\[5 minutes of brachial cuff inflation at 30 millimeters (mm) of mercury (Hg) followed by 5 minutes of cuff deflation\\] started as soon as possible after Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Final volume of cerebral infarction measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at Day 1 after thrombectomy","description":"Measurement of the final volume of cerebral infarction on Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequence by a blinding imaging reading committee.","timeFrame":"Day 1 after thrombectomy"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Neurological prognosis","description":"Functional neurological prognosis assessed by: 1/ National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on day 7 (NIHSS score for each ability is a number between 0 and 4 with 0 being normal functioning and 4 being completely impaired.
