This study will employ a treatment wait-list cross-over design, with half the participants randomized to receive the intervention first (treatment group), while the other half receives the interventions 2 months following the end of the treatment phase (wait-list group).","detailedDescription":"Stroke survivors face many concerns, including the physical, psychological, cognitive and psychosocial consequences of stroke, as well as impaired function and quality of life. Also important for stroke survivors is the possibility of recurrence that may result in death and further disability. Survivors depend on their caregivers to provide assistance for daily living tasks, emotional support and taking on new roles and responsibilities with changing social dynamics, often causing long-term strain.\n\nMindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are psychotherapeutic interventions which have been shown to improve psychological, physiological and psychosocial outcomes such as anxiety, depression, mental fatigue, blood pressure and overall quality of life. However, data is limited for stroke survivors and their caregivers, especially in Asians. This study will evaluate the impact of MBIs on the psychological well-being and perceived quality of life among stroke survivors and their family caregivers in Singapore.\n\nThis study employs a randomized treatment-waitlist crossover design with outcome measures administered before and after the intervention as well as at 3 months follow-up for the treatment group.\n\nThe intervention consists of 4 weekly 2-hour mindfulness sessions. Participants will be introduced, taught and guided in practice of mindfulness-based interventions that are focused on their (1) breath, (2) senses, (3) body and bodily movement, (4) feelings of empathy and compassion. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires will be conducted to assess symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, stress and perceived quality of life. Blood pressure and heart rate variability recordings before and after intervention will also be noted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stress","Anxiety","Depression"],"keywords":["Mindfulness","Stroke Survivors","Caregivers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Participants are randomized to receive either the intervention or treatment as usual.
