The traditional antibiotic model proved ineffective, and new prevention and treatment methods were urgently sought.This study intends to use a standardized and rigorous cohort study to collect biological samples (including throat swabs, sputum and blood) of eligible subjects, and to explore the microbial-host interaction relationship in patients with SAP, which may provide new targets and new ideas for the prevention and control of SAP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke-related Pneumonia"],"keywords":["Stroke-related pneumonia","micropopulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"All biological specimens (including throat swabs, sputum, blood) will be stored in the biological resource center of the study site after obtaining written informed consent from all subjects who volunteered to participate in the clinical study."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":240,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy control group","description":"age\\> 18, without lung disease"},{"label":"NSAP group","description":"patients with no stroke pneumonia"},{"label":"SAP group","description":"Those diagnosed with stroke-related pneumonia"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in the microbiota in throat swabs and sputum","description":"Microbiota changes in each set of throat swabs and sputum will be examined using 16s DNA / metagenome sequencing.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days after enrollment, or at discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Utility-weighted modified Rankin scale score","description":"Utility-weighted modified Rankin scale score.
