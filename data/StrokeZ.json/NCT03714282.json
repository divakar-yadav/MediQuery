Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk the entire distance and past the end line approximately 1 meter. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration.

The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at study completion. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.\n\nThis test will be administered while wearing a portable gas analysis system called the Cosmed K4B2 to measure oxygen consumption. This system measures oxygen consumption (VO2) and Carbon-dioxide production (VCO2) in a breath by breath fashion.","timeFrame":"Session 1 (baseline test, initial visit), Midpoint, Post intervention, 3 month follow-up, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up"},{"measure":"4.

TMS is a safe, non-invasive, painless method of brain stimulation that widely used to study the physiology of the representations of muscles in the motor cortex in healthy and neurologically disordered individuals. Very short duration (\\< 1 ms) magnetic pulses are applied via an insulated wire coil placed on the intact scalp overlaying the motor cortical area projecting to a target muscle. Each pulse induces a motor evoked potential (MEP) in a target muscle that can be readily monitored by recording Electromyogram EMG from that muscle.","timeFrame":"Baseline, Post intervention"},{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke","description":"The purpose of the FMA is to evaluate and measure recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients.
