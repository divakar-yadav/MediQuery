The questions in this study are:\n\n* what abnormalities can physiotherapists detect when observing a patient walking?\n* what do they consider the main problem that has a negative effect on the patient's walking?\n* what hypothesis do they generate?\n* how is the inter-rater reliability for the \"main problem\" and the hypothesis?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Clinical Reasoning","Physiotherapists"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PT's working in stroke in NW-Switzerland","description":"54 Physiotherapists (PT's) working in north-west Switzerland (at Bruderholzspital, RehaB Basel, Klinik Tschugg, Reha Rheinfelden, RehaClinic Zurzach) are asked to analyse videos of 6 hemiplegic patients when walking.
