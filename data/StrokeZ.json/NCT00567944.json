Assessments are repeated at the end of clinic training. Following clinic training, subjects take the device home to use for two (2) 20 minute training sessions each day. Subjects return to the clinic for one (1) day of testing after using the device at home for 7 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Physical Therapy Modalities","Electric Stimulation","Postural Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"BrainPort Balance Device","description":"The BrainPort balance device, is a non-invasive medical device that provides head and body position information to a person via their tongue."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dynamic Gait Index","timeFrame":"baseline, 5 days, end of study"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline, 5 days, end of study"},{"measure":"Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline, 5 days, end of study"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go","timeFrame":"Baseline, 5 days, end of study"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline, 5 day, end of study"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* At least 18 years old.\n* Diagnosis of stroke for at least 6 months.\n* Reached a plateau and been discharged from physical therapy.\n* Able to ambulate with or without assistance.\n* Ongoing balance problem.\n* Able to read and understand the informed consent form, and willing to sign the informed consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Current oral health problems as determined by health questionnaire and an examination of the oral cavity.\n* Any medical condition that would interfere with performance on the assessments.\n* History of seizures.\n* Pregnancy.\n* Cognitive deficits (Mini-Mental 25 or below), joint replacements, cervical vertigo, or major neurologic disease, major depression or disabling psychiatric disorder.\n* Known neuropathies of tongue or skin tactile system.\n* Prior exposure to BrainPort® balance device.\n* Subjects who are unwilling or unable to adhere to all study requirements, including completion of the training period, evaluation tests, and return to clinic for a follow-up visit.\n* Subjects who have undergone middle ear or other surgery with sacrifice or damage to the chorda tympani nerve, lingual nerve, or hypoglossal nerve.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mary Beth Badke, PT, PhD","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin, Madison","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","city":"Middleton","state":"Wisconsin","zip":"53562","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":43.09722,"lon":-89.50429}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"14643370","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Bach-y-Rita P, W Kercel S.
