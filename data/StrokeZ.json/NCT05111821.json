While acute therapies have made huge progresses, the number of survivors leaving with clinical consequences of stroke is increasing. Beyond stroke itself, secondary neurodegeneration of disconnected areas, especially of central hubs such as the substantia nigra or the thalamus, could significantly impact the overall outcome of the patients. Data have identified iron accumulation within the disconnected areas as potentially accelerating neurodegeneration. In this research, the main objective is test whether long-term chelation through Deferiprone (FerrirpoxÂ®, Chiesi) administered daily from 3-to-5 days following stroke to 6 months could avoid iron accumulation as measured with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within disconnected areas (substantia nigra).\n\nMRI imaging methods such as the quantification of the transverse relaxation rate R2\\* provide highly correlated information to the histologically measured iron load"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Deferiprone","Iron accumulation","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Neuroprotective treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Deferiprone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receiving Deferiprone during 6 months.
