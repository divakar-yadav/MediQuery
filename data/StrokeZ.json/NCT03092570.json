In order to have a control group to refer to, the effect of cerebellar stimulation on healthy young and old participants will also be assessed.","detailedDescription":"Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) are the first cause of acquired disability in France. Despite rehabilitation interventions, a great proportion of patients suffers from motor disability in the upper limb. Recently, several studies have shown that post CVA patients exhibit great neural plasticity as a direct consequence of their condition.\n\nInterestingly, the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive electro stimulation technique that allows for a modulation of cerebral activity. It has been shown that when applied to the cerebellum, tDCS increases learning performances of healthy subjects. Yet, motor rehabilitation after a CVA highly relies on motor (re)learning. The cerebellar tDCS thus appear as a promising method to enhance the performance of post-CVA motor learning and consequently the benefits of post-CVA rehabilitation.\n\nThe current study aims to promote the post CVA neural plasticity by using the tDCS in order to enhance motor learning of the upper limb."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Motor learning","stroke","tDCS","upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS Post-CVA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will get a 20min stimulation at a maximal intensity of 2mA","interventionNames":["Device: With stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Post-CVA","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The tDCS will be placed as for the Experimental group and will last 30 seconds at the beginning of task","interventionNames":["Device: No stimulation"]},{"label":"tDCS Young Healthy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will get a 20min stimulation at a maximal intensity of 2mA","interventionNames":["Device: With stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Young Healthy","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The tDCS will be placed as for the Experimental group and will last 30 seconds at the beginning of task","interventionNames":["Device: No stimulation"]},{"label":"tDCS Older Healthy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will get a 20min stimulation at a maximal intensity of 2mA","interventionNames":["Device: With stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Older Healthy","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The tDCS will be placed as for the Experimental group and will last 30 seconds at the beginning of task","interventionNames":["Device: No stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"With stimulation","description":"ramp stimulation from 0 to 2 mA followed by 20 minutes of stimulation at 2mA while practicing during 3 of the 4 sessions","armGroupLabels":["tDCS Older Healthy","tDCS Post-CVA","tDCS Young Healthy"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"No stimulation","description":"ramp stimulation from 0 to 2 mA followed by 30 sec of stimulation at 2mA.","armGroupLabels":["Sham Older Healthy","Sham Post-CVA","Sham Young Healthy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Force control","description":"Measurement in Newton of the force applied by each finger.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Force control","description":"Measurement in Newton of the force applied by each finger.","timeFrame":"Day 2"},{"measure":"Force control","description":"Measurement in Newton of the force applied by each finger.","timeFrame":"Day 3"},{"measure":"Force control","description":"Measurement in Newton of the force applied by each finger.","timeFrame":"Day 10"},{"measure":"Overflow","description":"Measurement in ms of the involuntary finger movements.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Overflow","description":"Measurement in ms of the involuntary finger movements.","timeFrame":"Day 2"},{"measure":"Overflow","description":"Measurement in ms of the involuntary finger movements.","timeFrame":"Day 3"},{"measure":"Overflow","description":"Measurement in ms of the involuntary finger movements.","timeFrame":"Day 10"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Moberg Pick-up Test","description":"Assessment of the functionality of the hand.
