The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three different montages of tDCS (anodal, cathodal and bilateral) in reducing the risk of falls and recovery of lower limb function in acute stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized sham-controlled trial reported following the 2010 CONSORT guidelines. The subjects were randomly allocated into 1 of 4 groups in a double-blinded parallel study design.
