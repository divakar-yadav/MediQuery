Determine the proportion of subjects with slight or no disability (a modified Rankin score (mRS) of 0-2) at 3 months after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA and compare with historical controls who were treated with IV rt-PA to identify (or lack of) futility.\n3. Determine the proportion of subjects with improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥8 points or achieving a score of 0-1 at 24 hours after the onset of stroke among subjects with acute ischemic stroke after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.\n4. Determine the proportion of subjects with angiographic recanalization on post procedure angiogram according to modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) perfusion flow categories among subjects with acute ischemic stroke after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.\n5. Determine the proportion of subjects with treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) within 72 hours and development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 27 ±3hrs post treatment among subjects with acute ischemic stroke after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.","detailedDescription":"A phase II trial is proposed to address the question whether administration of intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute ischemic stroke patients who are candidates for endovascular treatment provides any additional value. The phase II trial will treat consecutive patients who are candidates for IV rt-PA and mechanical thrombectomy with just mechanical thrombectomy alone. Such trial will generate the necessary data for a definitive phase III trial. The trial is designed based on low rate of recanalization in patients with major arterial occlusion with IV rt-PA alone and no difference in rate of recanalization or distal embolization in patients who receive IV rt-PA and those who do not prior to mechanical thrombectomy. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and cost of hospitalization are higher when IV rt-PA is administered prior to mechanical thrombectomy. The trial will determine the proportion of patients with slight or no disability (a modified Rankin score (mRS) of 0-2) at 3 months after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA and compare with historical controls who were treated with IV rt-PA to determine futility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","endovascular treatment","recombinant tissue plasminogen activator","mechanical thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be assigned to receive endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Thrombectomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Thrombectomy","description":"Participants will receive endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.","armGroupLabels":["Thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Favorable Outcome","description":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2: 0, No symptoms at all; 1, No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities; 2, Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance.
