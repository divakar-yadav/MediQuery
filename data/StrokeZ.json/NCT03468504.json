This study has been conducted as part of a PhD qualification at the Institute of Technology Sligo in Ireland with all therapy sessions taking place at the institute. The study was conducted in conjunction with Sligo University Hospital and it attained ethical approval through the relevant University Hospital Ethics Committee.","detailedDescription":"The study necessitated patients with chronic stroke to walk on a treadmill while viewing a reflection of their non-affected limb in a mirror. There was also a placebo group and these patients walked on the treadmill and viewed a mirror in an altered position. Patients were referred through Hospital Health Professionals. Prior to trial commencement all participants were given comprehensive trial information and provided signed written informed consent. A total of 30 participants were recruited. Patients attended the study for 30 minutes per day, three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received outcome assessment prior to the beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at three month followup assessment. All assessments were carried out by a Chartered Physiotherapist specialising in stroke rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using established outcome measures for lower limb motor function, muscle tone, walking speed and endurance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot Randomised Placebo Controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Experimental Group saw mirror image of non-affected limb in mirror while walking on treadmill.\n\nPlacebo Group saw no refection of the non-affected limb due to positioning of mirror while walking on treadmill.\n\nOutcome assessor was blinded to treatment allocation.
