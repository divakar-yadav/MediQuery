Main objective is to assess effectiveness of neuromuscular electroestimulation (NMES) in combination with respiratory muscle training (RMT) in the treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia in subacute stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Dysphagia is present in a significant proportion of subacute stroke patients (up to 85%, depending on the series) and is associated with an increase in medical complications such as bronchoaspirative pneumoniae which is responsible for approximately half of the deaths that occur in these patients. Besides, the risk of pneumonia in patients with dysphagia is three times higher compared to those patients without. Since there is no drug able to restore the swallowing and respiratory muscle function, neurological rehabilitation apperars to be as the mainstay of treatment of these disorders.\n\nRespiratory muscle weakness is common after stroke, but how it contributes in the development of bronchoaspiration pneumonia is not well determined. In acute phases of stroke, the mechanism seems to be more related to an impaired central drive than the reduction of strength in respiratory muscle.\n\nOtherwise, the NMES aims to improve muscle strength. The NMES accelerates swallowing recovery since it induces brain reorganitzation after stroke through sensory and motor stimulation of peripheral nerves, mainly in swallowing aerea."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia"],"keywords":["respiratory muscle training","neuromuscular electrical stimulation","oropharyngeal dysphagia","stroke","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RMT + usual care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Device: Orygen-Dual® valve trainer Intensity: 30% of maximal respiratory pressures (increasing intervals: 10 cmH2O per week) Training schedule: 5 sets of 10 repetitions followed by 1-2 minutes of unloaded recovery breathing off the device, two sessions per day, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Procedure: RMT + usual care"]},{"label":"NMES + usual care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Device: Vital Stim (Chattanooga Group, Hixson, TN, USA) Administration of 80 Hz transcutaneous electrical biphasic stimulus Schedule: 40 minutes per day, 5 sessions per week during hospitalization in the Neurorehabilitation ward (3 weeks approx).","interventionNames":["Procedure: NMES"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual care (standard multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation program) consisting of physical, occupational and speech therapy sessions to improve activities of daily life, mobility and communication skills (minimum 3 hours per day, 5 days a week, during 3 weeks), Standard swallow therapy (usual care of dysphagia in stroke patients) consists of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy targeting specific swallow impairments.
