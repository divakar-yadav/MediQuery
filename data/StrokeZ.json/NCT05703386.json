The hallmark of CSVD is the appearance and progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI. The goal of this study it to recruit and follow individuals at risk for WMH progression and use serial MRI scanning to gain insights into the pathogenesis of CSVD.","detailedDescription":"Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) which is attributed in large part to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is prevalent in patients with a history of stroke and vascular risk factors. The hallmark of CSVD is white matter hyperintensities (WMH) seen on T2-weighted MRI. The initial amount, and rate of progression, of WMH is tied closely with the development and progression cognitive deficits. It is hypothesized that one of the early pathologic features in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM), before it progresses to WMH is disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and loss of micro-structural integrity. The purpose of this study is track the progression of WMH using multiple MRI biomarkers looking at BBB disruption (DCE, DSC, ASL), micro-structural changes (multi-shell DTI), and macrostructural changes (FLAIR, SWI, T1) to better understand the pathogenesis of CSVD. Patients with a history of a stroke, at least one vascular risk factor, and evidence of CSVD on MRI may be eligible for this study. We will follow 50 patients with 3 MRIs performed over 1.25 years"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hypertension","Hyperlipidemias","Diabetes"],"keywords":["Cerebral small vessel disease","Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia","White matter hyperintensities","Blood-brain barrier","Vascular risk factors","Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression of cerebral small vessel disease","description":"Conversion of normal appearing white matter to white matter hyperintensity measured on MRI using 3D FLAIR imaging.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical or radiographic evidence of ischemic stroke\n* One vascular risk factor (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes)\n* Evidence of cerebral small vessel disease on MRI\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to complete 3 research MRI scans over 1.25 years","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients who are identified as having had an ischemic stroke, have at least one vascular risk factor, have had an MRI demonstrating cerebral small vessel disease and are willing and able to come to our research facility in Baltimore for 3 MRI scans over 1.25 years.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Pooja Patel","role":"CONTACT","phone":"410-502-5355","email":"ppate120@jhmi.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Richard Leigh, MD","affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kennedy Krieger Institute","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21205","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Pooja Patel","role":"CONTACT","phone":"410-502-5355","email":"ppate120@jhmi.edu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000059345","term":"Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases"},{"id":"D000006949","term":"Hyperlipidemias"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000050171","term":"Dyslipidemias"},{"id":"D000052439","term":"Lipid Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6805","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6594","name":"Dementia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M29395","name":"Cognitive Dysfunction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9690","name":"Hyperlipidemias","asFound":"Hyperlipidemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M29127","name":"Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","asFound":"Cerebral Small Vessel Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9692","name":"Hyperlipoproteinemias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25871","name":"Dyslipidemias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26719","name":"Lipid Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
