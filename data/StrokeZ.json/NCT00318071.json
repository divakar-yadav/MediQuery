Patients that were contraindicated or failed treatment with intravenous t-PA were allowed to be enrolled under the Multi MERCI protocol.\n\nPer the Multi MERCI protocol, following inclusion of the Merci L5 Retriever the operating physician was required to initiate treatment with the Merci L5 Retriever. At the physician's discretion, subsequent passes could be made with the Merci L5 Retriever, Merci X6 Retriever and/or Merci X5 Retriever.\n\nAdverse events were adjudicated by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (Capital DSMB)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemic","Thrombus","Embolectomy","Thrombectomy","Merci","Concentric","Embolus","Embolism","Mechanical"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":164,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment arm patients had at least one Merci Retriever deployed","interventionNames":["Device: Merci Retriever"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Merci Retriever","description":"For patients eligible to participate in the trial, the operating physician initiated treatment with the Merci L5 Retriever to remove large vessel thrombotic occlusion and recanalization of the vessel.
