Historically, Vitamin K antagonist therapy with Warfarin has been the treatment of choice for prophylaxis against stroke and systemic arterial thromboembolism in NOAF. Warfarin inhibits the Vitamin K dependent factors involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades, thus decreasing systemic clotting. However, Warfarin therapy comes with many challenges including prolonged titration, tedious monitoring requirements and in some cases, increased bleeding risk.\n\nThe limitations associated with Warfarin may be mitigated by using new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) like Rivaroxaban which have no routine monitoring requirements. Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of Factor Xa, a central reactant in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades. Studies in non-operative patients with atrial fibrillation have shown that Rivaroxaban is non-inferior to Warfarin for stroke prophylaxis with similar risk profiles. This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and financial cost of these two drugs when used for the management of new onset atrial fibrillation that occurs after cardiac operations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Bleeding"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Rivaroxaban","Warfarin","Stroke","Anticoagulation","Bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Cardiac surgery patients who meet study criteria and develop recurrent or persistent atrial fibrillation post-operatively will be randomized 1:1 to receive Warfarin or Rivaroxaban for prophylaxis against stroke or other systemic arterial embolism","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Statisticians performing comparative analyses of primary outcomes will be blinded as to the allocation designations of patients.
