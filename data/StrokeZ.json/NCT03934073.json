A lack of hand control makes everyday tasks more difficult and reduces the quality of life. The investigators lack approaches to specifically rehabilitate the hand after stroke.\n\nRecently, a new tool has been developed to measure manual dexterity (the Finger Force Manipulandum or FFM). This tool, which records the forces applied by the fingers on pistons, allows to measure more finely the key components of manual dexterity during visuomotor tasks. The tool measures the ability to control and release the force applied by the fingers, to perform sequences, to track and maintain a frequency of tapping (temporality of movement) with the fingers, and to use the fingers independently one another.","detailedDescription":"The DexTrain proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the benefit of a training using a tool, an improved version of the FFM, named DexTrain, for the rehabilitation and specific training of the fingers in subjects suffering from stroke. In this study the investigators will compare the effect of conventional therapy with that of the DexTrain method, particularly on the function of the hand and its spontaneous use at home (ecological condition). To better understand the mechanisms involved, the investigators will also study brain plasticity using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (SMT) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Vascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DEXTRAIN","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The DexTrain group sessions will consist of 20 minutes of conventional training followed by 40 minutes of exercises using the DexTrain targeting dexterity components.","interventionNames":["Other: DEXTRAIN"]},{"label":"CONVENTIONNELLE","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional training involving stretching of the spastic muscles as well as a set of exercises conventionally used in the protocols of post-stroke rehabilitation (repeated movements, manipulation of objects).","interventionNames":["Other: CONVENTIONNELLE"]},{"label":"CONTROLE","type":"OTHER","description":"To compare the results of SMT and functional MRI.","interventionNames":["Other: CONTROLE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"DEXTRAIN","description":"12 sessions of 1 hour of rehabilitation (3 sessions / 4 weeks) for the DexTrain group will consist of 20 minutes of conventional training followed by 40 minutes of exercises using the DexTrain targeting the dexterity components.","armGroupLabels":["DEXTRAIN"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"CONVENTIONNELLE","description":"12 sessions of 1 hour of rehabilitation (3 sessions / 4 weeks) Conventional will be constituted of conventional training consisting of stretching of the spastic muscles as well as exercises used classically in the protocols of rehabilitation post-stroke","armGroupLabels":["CONVENTIONNELLE"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"CONTROLE","description":"Only one assessment will be provided for the control group which will include, Box \\& Blocks Test (BBT), FFM Dexterity Assessment, Moberg Pick-Up Test (MPUT), Maximal Finger Tapping Rate, Proprioception, SMT, fMRI, Spontaneous hand activity (accelerometry / portable electromyography)","armGroupLabels":["CONTROLE"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Box and Block test score","description":"Change of the Box and Block test score, a measure of the number of blocks the subject can move in 1min, between the beginning (T0) and immediately after the end of treatment (T1).
