A non-randomized feasibility study using a 4-week UE training protocol will be conducted in 15 individuals within the first 12 months post-stroke living in the community. EMA data will be collected using a mobile app to automate real-time collection of adherence data on a daily basis. MI will be used to produce self-generated training plans (training goals, training schedule), guided by the therapist before the start of training.","detailedDescription":"Using a mixed methods design, the study will collect quantitative data before, during, and after training. Qualitative data will be collected after the training period and analyzed to explain the quantitative findings in depth, within the context of everyday life. Study aim 1 is to evaluate the feasibility of using EMA to measure adherence and of applying the MI approach. Quantitative data will include four indicators of adherence and accuracy. Interview responses will be used as qualitative data to elucidate participants' acceptance of the MI approach and feedback on using the EMA app. Study aim 2 is to explore to what extent UE outcomes change after the 4-week self-initiated home-based rehabilitation program. Outcomes will include UE use in real-world environments and self-perceived changes in UE use."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","upper extremity","motivational interviewing","shared decision making","ecological momentary assessments","self-initiated training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects with motor impairment will work closely with an occupational therapist to identify a goal and select activities that they will work on at home to improve the function of their affected arm.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Therapist guided training","Behavioral: Upper extremity (UE) Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Therapist guided training","description":"Therapist guided period delivered virtually (WebEx/Zoom).
