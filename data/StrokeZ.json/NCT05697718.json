Studies have shown that MSCs have the potential to differentiate not only to bone, cartilage, fat and myogenic cells, but also to neurons.Among them, human cord blood mesenchymal stem cells are a kind of mature mesenchymal stem cells currently used. Human cord blood mesenchymal stem cells are ideal seed cells for tissue engineering. In addition to the advantages of convenient acquisition, rich source, easy expansion, etc., human cord blood collection also has the following advantages: (1) Collection of cord blood has no harm to maternal and newborn;(2) The cells are more primitive and have stronger ability of proliferation and differentiation;(3) Low immunogenicity, strong tolerance to human leukocyte antigen and low incidence of rejection;(4) The infection and transmission probability of tumor cells, viruses and pathogenic microorganisms is relatively low;(5) It does not involve many controversies in social, ethical and legal aspects.Current studies believe that the possible mechanisms of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of stroke include replacing damaged nerve cells, promoting the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous nerve cells, secreting neurotrophic factors, promoting angiogenesis, reducing nerve cell apoptosis, and inhibiting inflammation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells（hMSCs）5.0×10\\^7 cells","interventionNames":["Biological: MSC"]},{"label":"group 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells（hMSCs）10.0×10\\^7 cells","interventionNames":["Biological: MSC"]},{"label":"group 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells（hMSCs）20.0×10\\^7 cells","interventionNames":["Biological: MSC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"MSC","description":"a single injection dose i.v.","armGroupLabels":["group 1","group 2","group 3"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 1"},{"measure":"adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 4"},{"measure":"adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 12"},{"measure":"adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 24"},{"measure":"serious adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 1"},{"measure":"serious adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 4"},{"measure":"serious adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 12"},{"measure":"serious adverse events","description":"assessed by CTCAE grade","timeFrame":"week 24"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
