The study will include 40 acute stroke subjects. Participants will undergo a global cognitive assessment with the MoCA test and a specific assessment of executive functions with the abbreviated Wisconsin test, the five digit test and the digit span evaluation (a subtest from the Wechsler intelligence scale for adults-IV). Participants will then undergo real or sham stimulation with anodal tDCS combined with cognitive training of the main executive functions: working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. After a 10-session intervention, a the baseline cognitive assessment will be repeated and subsequently, a follow-up of up to 12 months will be carried out."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal tDCS combined with cognitive training, stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To stimulate the left DLPFC, the anode electrode will be placed over F3 and the cathode will be placed over the right supraorbital region (Fp2).
