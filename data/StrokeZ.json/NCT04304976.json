Active training capabilities will be assessed, 3 active motions are planned (the therapist has to be active) by the therapist, and manually performed by hand. The resistance perceived by the therapist is then compared to the expert opinion of the therapist to evaluate if this correlates with, small, medium, and large resistance. This is evaluated as passed/not passed for all 3 motions\n2. Active assistive training capabilities will be assessed: 3 passive motions are planned (the robot moves, the therapist follows movement), by the therapist and the robot starts performing the motions, the therapist performs a small, moderate and large assistive movement in conjunction with the robot. The results in % of activity in the path of motion are displayed, and the therapist evaluates if this is in agreement with what they would categorise as a small, moderate and large assistive movement respectively. This is evaluated as passed/not passed for all 3 motions.","timeFrame":"Up to 19 weeks"},{"measure":"Safety, Capture adverse events.","description":"Safety is evaluated during patient use, nr of treatment-related adverse events is recorded during training sessions.","timeFrame":"Up to 19 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hospitalised patients at Neuro Unit North, during the trial period.\n* 18 years or older.\n* Can read, understand and speak Danish\n* Reduced motor function in lower extremities.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No able to sign informed consent.\n* Cannot read, understand or speak Danish\n* Patients with unstable fractures in columna, pelvis or lower extremities.\n* Patients with the risk of ulcers, or with exceedingly sensitive skin.\n* The patient is refusing to train with ROBERT®","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Helle Rovsing Jørgensen, Therapist","affiliation":"Neuro Unit Nord, Denmark","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Region Hospital, Neuro Unit Nord.","city":"Frederikshavn","state":"Nordjylland","zip":"9900","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":57.44073,"lon":10.53661}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20197531","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Wunsch H, Guerra C, Barnato AE, Angus DC, Li G, Linde-Zwirble WT.
