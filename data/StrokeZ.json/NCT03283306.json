Plaque enhancement with CEUS showed correlation with the histologic density of neovessels within the carotid plaque and the previous cardiovascular events. Vulnerable plaques with a high risk of thromboembolic complications and rapid progression is associated with acute ischemic stroke. The prognostic value of vulnerable carotid artery plaque depicted with CEUS has not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study is to define prognostic value of plaque enhancement on carotid CEUS in acute stroke patients. Research question is; in acute ischemic stroke patients with ipsilateral carotid plaque as probable etiology of stroke, is the presence of carotid plaque enhancement on CEUS independent predictor of future stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ultrasonography","Carotid Stenosis","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":667,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite of recurrent stroke, vascular death and myocardial infarction","description":"(1) recurrent stroke: newly appeared DWI positive lesion on brain MRI with corresponding neurologic symptom (2) vascular death: sudden death, death due to stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, systemic bleeding, or ischemia of organ.
