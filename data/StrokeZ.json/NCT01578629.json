Vitamin E has blood-thinning properties and lowers cholesterol, which make it a potential therapy for stroke prevention, though these effects are less well characterized for TCT. We plan to conduct two trials (I \\& IIA) to determine the effects of orally supplemented TCT on platelet function and cholesterol. Phase I subjects will be healthy volunteers, recruited by an advertisement. Phase IIA subjects will be hyperlipidemic (having high cholesterol), and will be referred to us by their Wound Care Center Physicians. Patients will be randomized to receive placebo pills, (400 or 800 mg) TCT pills, low-dose 81 mg aspirin (commonly used for secondary prevention of stroke), or TCT and aspirin together. Potential subjects for Phase-I who meet study criteria and agree to participate will be in the study for 6 months and have the following study related procedures, blood draw total 4 times, tape stripping (non-invasive procedure), BMI, and blood pressure measurement at each visit (every month). Participants in Phase-IIA will have blood drawn a total of 6 times, tape stripping, BMI and blood pressure measurement and participants will be in the study for 13 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack
