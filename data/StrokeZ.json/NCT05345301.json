However, motor recovery for stroke survivors is not fully understood. One of the challenges to understand the mechanisms behind recovery is the capability of the brain to reorganize and re-activate areas affected by the stroke. Brain computer interface (BCI) has shown promise in previous studies to improve motor capabilities of individuals with damaged nervous systems by reactivating damaged motor pathways.\n\nIn order to understand how BCI can be incorporated into upper extremity rehabilitation, investigators must first lay the groundwork of measuring neural activity and its relation to muscle activity in individuals who have experienced a stroke. While instructing participants to open and close their hand, investigators will measure (1) neural activity, called sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), using a electrophysiological (EEG) cap, and (2) muscle activity using wireless electromyography (EMGs). What the investigators are specifically looking for is an event in the neural activity in between movement initiation and termination called event related desynchronization (ERD). The investigators of this study hypothesize that there is greater activation of ERDs in stroke's subjects SMR activity after completing finger extension and flexion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper Extremity","Body Computer Interface"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Measuring neural activity","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"While completing hand opening/closing, individuals will have the following measured (1) Neural activity (specifically sensorimotor rhythms) using a EEG cap; (2) muscle activity (specifically finger flexors and extensors) using EMG sensors.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Event related desynchronization measurement"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Event related desynchronization measurement","description":"Individuals will spend one hour and receive cues to open or close their hand while wearing a EEG cap and EMG sensors on their forearm.","armGroupLabels":["Measuring neural activity"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of activation of Event Related Desynchronization","description":"Sensorimotor neural activity","timeFrame":"1 hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (6 months post stroke)\n* Hemiparesis\n* Some degree of hand and finger movement capability\n* a moderate impairment (Fugl-Meyer score between 15-50)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals under the age of 18\n* Bilateral paresis\n* Hand pain and/or extreme articular contractures on the finger joints (Modified Ashworth Scale of 4)\n* Botox injection to the affected upper extremity within the previous 4 months\n* Aphasia, cognitive impairment, or affective dysfunction that would influence the ability to perform the experiment","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Shirley Ryan AbilityLab","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60611","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"24111256","type":"RESULT","citation":"Ang KK, Guan C, Chua KS, Phua KS, Wang C, Chin ZY, Zhou L, Tang KY, Joseph GJ, Kuah C.
