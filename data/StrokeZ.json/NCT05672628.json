Finally, a copy of exercises for their home rehabilitation program will be provided. During the next rehabilitation visits, a trained research assistant will guide the stroke survivor with using the gaming headset. The session will be stopped every 20 minutes to make sure that the stroke survivor is feeling well and to give them a break. The stroke survivor may stop the session at any time. This session will last for an hour.","armGroupLabels":["Oculus VR"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of sessions attended","description":"The minimum number of sessions expected for a user are 2 per week (8 sessions)","timeFrame":"end of intervention( about 4 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the time spent using the Oculus VR","description":"the minimum time spent playing Job Simulator is 1 hour per week (4 hours)","timeFrame":"end of intervention( about 4 weeks from baseline)"},{"measure":"Usability as assessed by the score on the System Usability scale (SUS)","description":"This is a 10 item questionnaire and each is scored from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree).
