The median time to administrate de scale will be calculated.\n\nThe investigators will validate the scale by administering it to 300 consecutive patients within 24 hours after admission to our 2 stroke units (Centre Hospitalier de Versailles and Centre hospitalier du sud francilien) and to 100 stabilized patients with and without atypical crossed aphasia using the MEC-P evaluation as a reference.\n\nPatients must be 100% right-handed (Edinburgh test), be of French mother tongue, have no history of neurological disease, have no sensory disturbances (blindness, deafness) and no mirror crossed aphasia detected by the LAST (minimum score of 14/15 with a loss point granted for the \"automatic speech\" subtest, potentially stranded in right strokes)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Right hemispheric Stroke","Crossed aphasia","Acute
