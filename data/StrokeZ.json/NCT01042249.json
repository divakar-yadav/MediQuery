The subjects in the treatment group follows a 12 week standard PFMT program, while the control group is not given specific treatment of their LUTS but like the treatment group follows the standard rehabilitation program for stroke patient. Outcome are measured by\n\n* 5 questionnaires\n* Voiding diary\n* 24-hour pad test\n* pelvic floor muscle assessment test"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Male","Stroke","Urinary Incontinence"],"keywords":["PFMT","Stroke","LUTS","Men"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treated with Pelvic Floor Muscle Training in 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: Pelvic Floor Muscle training"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Receives standard rehabilitation after stroke"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Pelvic Floor Muscle training","description":"12 week training program including home exercises","armGroupLabels":["Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"DAN-PSS-1 questionnaire","timeFrame":"2010-2012"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pelvic Floor Muscle Assessment test","timeFrame":"2010-2012"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
