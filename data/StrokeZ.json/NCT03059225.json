Nevertheless, the efficacy of synchronous rTMS protocol integrated with computer-integrated speech training is not well understood. It is also not clear regarding the efficacy of compound bi-hemispheric stimulation protocol. The aim of the study is to investigate language response to these new strategies and to determine the longevity of the therapeutic outcome. Advanced MR neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and DTI, are powerful tools to evaluate the concomitant nervous changes after rTMS treatment on aphasic patients. The knowledge from fMRI and DTI microstructural evolution provides insight into underlined mechanism operating the language improvement.","detailedDescription":"The efficacy of synchronous rTMS protocol integrated with computer-integrated speech training is not well understood.
