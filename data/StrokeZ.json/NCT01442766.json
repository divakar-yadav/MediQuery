Recovery has been shown in animal models to be dependent upon adequate levels of acetylcholine within the brain - which in stroke is likely to be deficient. This is because acetylcholine-producing nerve cells in the brain are often damaged by strokes.\n\nConsequently, the investigators hypothesise that recovery may be improved by boosting acetylcholine levels in the brain - that can be readily achieved by treating with donepezil."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["cholinesterase inhibitor","donepezil","motor","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Donepezil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Donepezil"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Donepezil","description":"5mg for 4 weeks, 10mg for 8 weeks if tolerated, or lower dose to continue","armGroupLabels":["Donepezil"],"otherNames":["Aricept"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Inert pill that appears identical to donepezil pill. 1 pill for first 4 weeks, followed by 2 pills until end of study.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Score (out of 66) over 12 weeks","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Functional MRI Connectivity and Task-related activation (relative % BOLD signal change) over 12 weeks","description":"resting-state / activation-related fMRI","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number and type of participants with adverse events","description":"Self-reported / Questionnaire","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients diagnosed with acute stroke diagnosed on clinical and neuroimaging grounds who can enter the trial within the 1st week of stroke onset, and who have new motor dysfunction of an upper limb. Motor impairment should be moderate - severe (UE-FM Score â‰¤50 out of a total of 66).\n2. Age: above 18 years old.\n3. Patients able and willing to partake in motor tests, and to return for follow-up visit at 12 weeks.\n4. Able to understand English.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Contraindications for donepezil: pregnancy (\\* Female patients \\<50 years old will be asked if there is any possibility that they might be pregnant. If there is any uncertainty, or a likelihood that they are pregnant, this will qualify as an exclusion criterion)\\*; moderate - severe asthma (i.e. regular treatment prescribed for this); bradycardia, syncope, 2nd or 3rd degree heart block, acute or decompensated heart failure; peptic ulcer diagnosed endoscopically and on treatment for this; epilepsy; Parkinson's disease; end-stage renal failure or creatinine \\> 300 micromol/l; genitourinary tract or gastrointestinal tract obstruction; gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage; myasthenia gravis\n2. Other: functionally-significant cognitive impairment (i.e. dementia); significant receptive aphasia (i.e. such that cannot understand purpose or details of trial, and will be unable to cooperate with task instructions); significant physical infirmity as judged by treating physician (e.g. severe organ failure; terminal cancer).\n3. Contraindications for MRI (this only pertains for the subset of patients entering the MRI substudy, but is not a contra-indication to the main study providing a diagnosis of stroke is clear from CT): phobia, metal implants including pacemaker.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Paul Bentley, MA MRCP PhD","affiliation":"Imperial College London","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Academic Health Science Centre","city":"London","zip":"W6 8RF","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.50853,"lon":-0.12574}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Acute Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000077265","term":"Donepezil"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002800","term":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000004791","term":"Enzyme Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"},{"id":"D000018678","term":"Cholinergic Agents"},{"id":"D000018377","term":"Neurotransmitter Agents"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"},{"id":"D000018697","term":"Nootropic Agents"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M1721","name":"Donepezil","asFound":"Intranasal","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5730","name":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7641","name":"Enzyme Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20448","name":"Cholinergic Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20194","name":"Neurotransmitter Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20464","name":"Nootropic Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"NootAg","name":"Nootropic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
