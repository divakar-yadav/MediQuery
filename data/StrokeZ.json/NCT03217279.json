Stroke represents the leading cause of long-term disability. The specificity of stroke is the sequelae polymorphism that can occurs: physical disability, cognitive deficit and sensitive trouble. Then this large extend of sequelae may have a different impact on daily life. Therefore, we have to consider the individual's own resources and in his whole environment to face the situation. We suppose that each situation, each post-stroke disability will have a different social impact in stroke survivors and their caregivers. Nowadays, Barthel Index and Rankin scale are the standards for the assessment of the stroke impact on survivors' daily life. However, what is the real impact of an activity limitation in daily life? How consider the psychosocial impact of stroke only with functional indicators? For this study we will consider handicap and disability in a societal way. In fact, the WHO developed in 2001 the International Classification of functioning, disability and health that allows to bring the concept of participation restriction, this is to say the consequences of a disability in the real life. The ICF allows to bring a conceptual framework of participation restriction.\n\nPsychosocial consequences of stroke are relatively unknown especially in France. According to our hypothesis, patients with major disabilities and their caregivers will experience more psychosocial consequences and participation restriction in terms of emotional health, quality of life and burden. Also, we hypothesize that stroke severity, the typology of disabilities (motor, cognitive and sensorial) will have a different impact on patients and proxys' lifes in terms of psychosocial consequences, participation restriction and quality of life.\n\nTYBRA study is a prospective multicentric cohort study that mixes qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first aim of the quantitative approach is to explore factors related to patients and their caregivers at 6 months that predict participation restriction at 12 months post-stroke. The first aim of the qualitative study is to explore the experience of stroke in minor stroke patients and their proxys."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients and Their Caregivers"],"keywords":["stroke-participation","restriction-needs-cohort-patients-caregivers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":396,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from 6-month participation restriction at 12 months.","description":"Patients will receive at home questionnaires about the psychosocial consequences of stroke for them and their caregivers at 6 months and 12 months post stroke.\n\nScale 2.0 at 12 months.
