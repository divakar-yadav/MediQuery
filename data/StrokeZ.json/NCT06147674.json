The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Confirm the performance of non-invasive pulmonary health parameter shunt fraction value found on the VQm PHM™ when compared to available reference measurements.\n* Confirm the performance of non-invasive pulmonary health parameter pulmonary blood flow, functional residual capacity and physiological dead space found on the VQm PHM™ when compared to available reference measurements.","detailedDescription":"This is a multi-site, international, prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, observational study. This study aims to compare measurements from the VQm PHM™ to existing clinical measurements, assess safety of the device and determine effects that standard clinical events have on the VQm PHM™ measurements. This study does not include changes to clinical care based on measurements from the VQm PHM™.
