Searching for more efficient methods of antismoking interventions is therefore justified.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of three anti-smoking interventions of different intensities.\n\nDESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.\n\nMETHODS: Study participants will be recruited among patients of neurological clinics of Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, hospitalized because of their first in a lifetime ischemic stroke. All stroke patients will be screened regarding their smoking status. The subjects will be patients smoking cigarettes immediately before their first-ever stroke, able to understand the research protocol procedures and able to cooperate during the investigation.\n\nAntismoking interventions will be based on the \"5A's\" method. Study participants will be randomized to one of three interventions differing in follow-up intensity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","smoking cessation","antismoking interventions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":240,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Antismoking intervention with minimal early follow-up","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"an intervention according to the \"5A's\" model with one follow-up visit within one week after discharge from the hospital; follow-up assessment will include two visits: 3 and 12 months after stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Antismoking intervention with minimal early follow-up"]},{"label":"Antismoking intervention with no early follow-up","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"an anti-smoking intervention in line with the \"5A's\" method without early follow-up; follow-up assessment will be limited to two visits: 3 and 12 months after stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Antismoking intervention with no early follow-up"]},{"label":"Antismoking intervention with intensive early follow-up","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"an anti-smoking intervention in line with the \"5A's\" method will be given, including four follow-up visits within 6 weeks after discharge from the hospital (week 1, week 2, week 4, week 6 after stroke); follow-up assessment will include two visits: 3 and 12 months after stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Antismoking intervention with intensive early follow-up"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Antismoking intervention with no early follow-up","description":"an anti-smoking intervention in line with the \"5A's\" method without early follow-up; follow-up assessment will be limited to two visits: 3 and 12 months after stroke","armGroupLabels":["Antismoking intervention with no early follow-up"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Antismoking intervention with minimal early follow-up","description":"Anti-smoking intervention in line with the \"5A's\" method (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up.
