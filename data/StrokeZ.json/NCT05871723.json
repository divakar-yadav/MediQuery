Postural stability will be assessed using the Berg Balance Scale, a clinical balance test that assesses an individual's ability to maintain balance during various functional tasks. The Berg Balance Scale includes 14 items, such as standing unsupported, reaching forward, turning, and standing on one leg. The Berg Balance Scale is a widely used clinical balance test that has good reliability and validity in stroke patients. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including correlation and regression analysis, to investigate the relationship between the multifidus and gastrocnemius muscle thickness and postural stability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Postural; Defect","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Patients","description":"Patients diagnosed with stroke.","interventionNames":["Other: Measurement of multifidus and gastrocnemius muscle thickness with Ultrasound","Other: Berg Balance Scale"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Measurement of multifidus and gastrocnemius muscle thickness with Ultrasound","description":"o measure multifidus and gastrocnemius muscle thickness using ultrasound imaging, the following steps are typically followed. First, the patient is positioned appropriately to allow access to the muscles to be imaged. For example, the patient may lie prone for imaging of the lumbar multifidus or sit with the leg extended for imaging of the gastrocnemius. Next, a trained clinician or technician places an ultrasound probe on the skin over the target muscle and adjusts the settings on the ultrasound machine to optimize the image quality. The probe is then moved around to obtain different views of the muscle, and the images are stored for later analysis. To measure muscle thickness, the clinician or technician identifies the muscle fascia on the ultrasound image and measures the distance between the fascia and the underlying bone or tissue. This measurement provides an estimate of the muscle thickness.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Patients"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"The Berg Balance Scale is a clinical assessment tool used to measure an individual's ability to maintain balance during various functional tasks. The test includes 14 items, such as standing unsupported, reaching forward, turning, and standing on one leg. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (unable to perform the task) to 4 (able to perform the task independently and safely). The scores for each item are summed to provide a total score, with a maximum possible score of 56. The Berg Balance Scale is commonly used in clinical and research settings to assess balance impairment and monitor changes in balance over time, particularly in individuals with neurological conditions such as stroke. The test has good reliability and validity and is considered a gold standard for assessing balance in these populations.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relationship between multifidus thickness and postural stability","description":"he relationship between multifidus muscle thickness measured by ultrasound in cm and results of berg scale will be measured statistically by calculating correlation coefficients.\n\nThe Berg Balance Scale is a widely used clinical assessment tool designed to measure balance and stability in individuals who may have balance impairments due to various conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis.
