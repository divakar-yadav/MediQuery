The current monitors either require special drips (arterial and/or central lines) or a probe inserted into the oesophagus (food pipe) which may limit their use. Newer monitors are available which are completely non-invasive and seem to work well in younger patients. Patients with hip fracture are elderly and frail. The investigators wish to see whether the newer non-invasive monitor works well enough compared to the current monitors in this group of patients. If it does this may allow more of these patients to be monitored in this way.","detailedDescription":"The investigators wish to compare the accuracy of the newer, non-invasive monitor (Nexfin) against a more established minimally invasive monitor (LiDCO). The LiDCO has a calibration system which allows the absolute accuracy of the Nexfin to be established."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hip Fractures","Anesthesia"],"keywords":["Cardiac output","Stroke volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bias and limits of agreement of Nexfin recorded cardiac output compared with LiDCOplus","description":"Analysis of agreement between Nexfin cardiac output and the calibrated cardiac output measured by LiDCOplus","timeFrame":"During anaesthesia period of surgery - measurements will be complete within 30 minutes of starting anaesthesia"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bias and limits of agreement for change in cardiac output measured by Nexfin compared with LiDCO","description":"Comparison of relative changes in cardiac output recorded by Nexfin and LiDCO in response to intra-anaesthesia / intra-operative events (fluid administration, drug administration)","timeFrame":"During anaesthesia period of surgery - measurements will be complete within 30 minutes of starting anaesthesia"},{"measure":"Utility of Nexfin monitor","description":"Proportion of time during anaesthesia and surgery when a valid signal is obtained from the Nexfin device.","timeFrame":"Intra-operative - average duration about 1 hour"},{"measure":"Adverse events associated with Nexfin monitor","description":"Recording of adverse events associated with use of the Nexfin monitor","timeFrame":"Intra-operative - average duration about one hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged over 80\n* Able to give their own informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe valvular heart disease\n* Taking lithium","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Elderly patients undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Iain K Moppett, DM FRCA MRCP","affiliation":"University of Nottingham","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Nottingham University Hospitals","city":"Nottingham","state":"Notts","zip":"NG7 2UH","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":52.9536,"lon":-1.15047}},{"facility":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals","city":"Brighton","state":"Sussex","zip":"BN2 5BE","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":50.82838,"lon":-0.13947}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21955538","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Wiles MD, Whiteley WJ, Moran CG, Moppett IK.
