Although ischemic white matter disease (iWMD) may lack gross clinical manifestation, it causes significant cognitive impairment, particularly on measures of executive function, attention, and memory. This impairment is attributable to diffuse damage affecting network connections.\n\nWhile there are many studies concerning rehabilitation of motor function and language in patients with large focal strokes, few studies have addressed attentional and executive functions. To our knowledge, there are no such studies on iWMD. In this study, patients will be randomized to a novel intervention for improving executive function and a control condition matched for therapist exposure. Patients will be assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at long-term follow-up using a battery of behavioural and neuroimaging tasks. We predict that the novel intervention will be associated with improved executive function, as assessed behaviourally, and improved frontal network function, as assessed through neuroimaging markers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic White Matter Disease","Transient Ischemic Attack","Mild Stroke","Stroke Risk"],"keywords":["cognitive impairment","ischemic white matter disease","small vessel disease","transient ischemic attack","mild stroke","stroke risk"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Executive Function Training Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will receive the novel intervention training.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Executive Function Training Program"]},{"label":"Psychoeducational Training Program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group will receive the control intervention training.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Psychoeducational Training Program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Executive Function Training Program","description":"Participants will take part in ten 2-hour sessions over 5 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Executive Function Training Program"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Psychoeducational Training Program","description":"Participants will take part in ten 2-hour sessions over 5 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Psychoeducational Training Program"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in neuropsychological test performance at post-intervention","description":"Performance will be assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests of processing speed, attention, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, and learning and memory.
