Further, interim analysis of neurological outcomes at 75 patients of the randomized Phase IIb trial, demonstrated a signal of efficacy when compared to control (rt-PA alone) patients. However, rt-PA fails to reperfuse brain in most patients with large thrombi, prompting several recent randomized clinical trials which have demonstrated that intra-arterial therapy (IA) following rt-PA substantially improves outcome in patients with distal carotid or proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions. As a result, rt-PA + IA has become the new standard-of-care for many patients with large arterial occlusions such as those treated in ARTSS-1 and 2. Therefore, this study is necessary to explore the feasibility and safety of adding Argatroban in acute ischemic stroke patients who also receive rt-PA followed by IA.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo demonstrate the feasibility and safety of treating stroke patients with Argatroban who undergo usual thrombolysis care (intravenous rt-PA followed by IA).\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Assess rates of ultra-early recanalization at commencement of IA;\n2. Assess the completeness and pattern of reperfusion as obtained by IA; 3) Assess clinical outcome","detailedDescription":"Design:\n\nProspective, single-arm, open-label, feasibility and safety Phase IIa study.\n\nStudy Population:\n\n10 total ischemic stroke patients all treated with rt-PA (0-3 hour or 0-4.5 hour according to each site's local standard) and IA; age of 18 years or older; proximal (intracranial) artery occlusion as imaged by CT-angiogram (CTA).\n\nTreatment:\n\nAll patients will receive standard-of-care intravenous rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg; maximum 90 mg) and IA. Before the end of the 1 hour rt-PA infusion, a 3.0 mcg/kg/min continuous infusion of Argatroban, preceded by a 100 mcg/kg bolus will be administered over 3-5 minutes. Infusion will be titrated to achieve an aPTT of 2.25 times baseline (not to exceed 10 mcg/kg/min) for a maximum of 12 hours.\n\nAssessments:\n\n1. Baseline: History and physical exam, vital signs, CBC, liver function tests, PT/INR, PTT, non-contrast head CT, CT-Angiogram, NIHSS, mRS, concomitant medications.\n\n   Laboratory results must be reported before study drug administration.\n2. 0-24 hours: Vital signs, aPTT (scheduled 2, 6, 12 hours), NIHSS (24-hours), conventional angiography as part of usual care intra-arterial therapy. Repeat parenchymal brain imaging (non-contrast head CT or MRI) at 24 hours from rt-PA bolus. Laboratory testing work (same as baseline).\n3. Day 7/Discharge (whichever occurs first): Vital signs, mRS, NIHSS\n4. Day 90: mRS (obtained by certified rater)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Argatroban treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous Argatroban delivered at 100mcg/kg bolus, then 12-hour infusion initiated at 3mcg/kg/min.","interventionNames":["Drug: Argatroban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Argatroban","description":"All patients will receive a 3.0 mcg/kg/min continuous infusion of Argatroban, preceded by a 100 mcg/kg bolus.
