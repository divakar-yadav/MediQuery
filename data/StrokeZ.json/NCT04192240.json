Are there differences in weight-bearing (WB) and WB symmetry immediately following STS and stepping training with or without using external feedback in ambulatory patients with stroke?\n\n1. Are there differences in mobility immediately following STS and stepping training with or without using external feedback in ambulatory patients with stroke?","detailedDescription":"Subjects are patients with stroke, the age of over 40 years to 74 years, both males and females who are able to walk independently at least 10 meters. Most of them will be recruited from a tertiary rehabilitation center and communities. Subjects have to participate in STS and stepping training with and without using the external feedback for 1 time/condition with a wash-out period for 2 weeks (crossover design). The outcomes will be measured in terms of WB ability during STS and stepping, walking speed, and balance ability.\n\nThe primary outcomes were WB ability on the affected limb and WB symmetry. Secondary outcomes were walking speed and balance ability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["cerebrovascular disease","rehabilitation","walking","balance","mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"WB Training with external feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"WB during sit-to-stand with external feedback for 10 minute and then, WB during stepping training with external feedback for 10 minutes.
