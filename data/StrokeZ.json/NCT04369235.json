Therefore, the investigators aim to develop a set of tCES system with special waveforms for using in clinical rehabilitation of upper extremities. This developed tCES system is smaller than all commercial available products, which could be conveniently and portably wore on head for clinical rehabilitation. In addition, the present tCES system with special waveforms developing by the investigators is much more efficient on improving neuroplasticity than the traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in rats. The investigators hope the tCES system combined with the rehabilitation of body extremities will become a routine treatment for stroke patients at hospitals or residential rehabilitation in the future.","detailedDescription":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) were both demonstrated to have therapeutic potentials to rapidly induce neuroplastic effects in various rehabilitation training regimens. Recently, the investigators have developed a novel transcranial electrostimulation device that can flexibly output an electrical current with combined tDCS and iTBS waveforms. However, limited studies have determined the therapeutic effects of this special waveform combination on clinical rehabilitation. Herein, the investigators aiming to brain stimulation effects of tDCS-iTBS on upper-limb motor function in chronic stroke patients.\n\nTwenty-four subjects with a chronic stroke were randomly assigned to a real non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS; subjects received the real tDCS+iTBS output) group or a sham NIBS (subjects received sham tDCS+iTBS output) group. All subjects underwent 1 h treatment of a conventional rehabilitation program (3 days a week for 6 weeks), where a 20-min NIBS intervention was simultaneously applied during conventional rehabilitation. Outcome measures were assessed before and immediately after the intervention period: Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), and Finger-to-Nose Test (FNT)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Transcranial electrical stimulation","Upper-limb rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tCES & upper extremity rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experiment group will receive tCES combined with upper extremity rehabilitation of affected side.","interventionNames":["Device: tCES"]},{"label":"Sham tCES & upper extremity rehabilitation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham control group will receive sham tCES combined with upper extremity rehabilitation of affected side.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham tCES"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tCES","description":"The positions of the lesion side primary motor cortex were defined as C3/C4 according to the international 10-20 system of electroencephalograms. tCES will be applied for 20 minutes at an intensity of 1.0 -1.5 mA direct current stimulation and a specific-added waveform each time, 3 times a week, lasting for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["tCES & upper extremity rehabilitation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham tCES","description":"The positions of the lesion side primary motor cortex were defined as C3/C4 according to the international 10-20 system of electroencephalograms.
