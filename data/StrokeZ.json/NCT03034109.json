They can also have trouble concentrating, following instructions, and multitasking. These can all due to the stroke affecting a brain function called \"working memory\". Working memory is defined as the ability to hold a thought in one's mind for a few seconds in order to remember a task or solve a problem. People have difficulty returning to their normal lives because of these working memory problems. Currently, there no proven medical treatments for working memory problems.\n\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a painless, noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been shown in some studies to improve working memory in healthy subjects. TDCS involves sending a weak electrical current through the head, thereby exciting the brain underneath. TDCS is not an FDA-approved treatment for any condition, but previous trials have shown it may benefit movement and language recovery after stroke, as well as improve thinking ability. Studies have shown tDCS to be very safe with no serious adverse events in over 10,000 subjects studied.\n\nThis pilot study will involve four visits to Stony Brook University Hospital. The first is a baseline session where subjects perform all outcome measures but no tDCS is performed other than for familiarization. The other three sessions are the stimulation sessions where subjects undergo the intervention for 20 minutes to test tDCS effects on the outcome measures. The effects of tDCS for a single session are expected to only last for few hours. Subjects will be receiving all three different types of stimulation. If this study finds a short term benefit of tDCS for post-stroke working memory deficits, it will support a full clinical trial where multiple sessions of tDCS will be given and may provide a long-term benefit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Deficit","Cognitive Impairment","Short-Term Memory Impairment"],"keywords":["Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Stroke","Electric Stimulation Therapy","Prefrontal Cortex","Electroencephalography","Cognition","Neurological Rehabilitation","Memory","Working Memory","Attention","Concentration","Short-Term Memory","Planning","Executive Function","Cerebrovascular disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS conventional stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation:\n\nThe anode will be placed over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the cathode will be placed over the right supraorbital cortex.
