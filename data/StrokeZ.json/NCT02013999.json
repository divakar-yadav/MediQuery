The intervention group received 30 min of conventional occupational therapy (OT) and 30 min of the mobile upper extremity rehabilitation program using a smartphone and a tablet PC (MoU-Rehab). The controls (n = 12) received conventional OT alone for 1 h per day. Rehabilitation consisted of 10 sessions of therapy, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks. The outcome measures (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity \\[FMA-UE\\], Brunnstr¨om stage \\[B-stage\\] for the arm and the hand, manual muscle testing \\[MMT\\], modified Barthel index \\[MBI\\], EuroQol-5 Dimension \\[EQ-5D\\], and Beck Depression Inventory \\[BDI\\]) were assessed at the beginning and end of treatment, and at 1 month. User satisfaction was evaluated by a qestionnaire."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Dysfunction After the Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual reality program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"mobile device for virtual reality program","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual reality program for upper extremity rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"standard occupuational therapy","interventionNames":["Other: standard occupational therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual reality program for upper extremity rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Virtual reality program"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"standard occupational therapy","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scale","description":"for motor evaluation","timeFrame":"baseline(just before beginning the treatment), at the end of the treatment for 2 weeks, 1 month later of the end of the treatment for 2 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"brunnström stage","description":"for motor evaluation","timeFrame":"baseline(just before beginning the treatment), at the end of the treatment for 2 weeks, 1 month later of the end of the treatment for 2 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index","description":"for ADL independence","timeFrame":"baseline(just before beginning the treatment), at the end of the treatment for 2 weeks, 1 month later of the end of the treatment for 2 weeks"},{"measure":"Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale for Muscle Strength","description":"for motor evaluation","timeFrame":"baseline(just before beginning the treatment), at the end of the treatment for 2 weeks, 1 month later of the end of the treatment for 2 weeks"},{"measure":"Euroqol(EQ)-5D","description":"EQ-5D","timeFrame":"baseline(just before beginning the treatment), at the end of the treatment for 2 weeks, 1 month later of the end of the treatment for 2 weeks"},{"measure":"Virtual reality kinematic data","description":"Automatically recorded","timeFrame":"everytime when the patient uses program (automatically all recorded)"},{"measure":"questionnaire","description":"for user satisfaction","timeFrame":"at the end of the treatment for 2 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed by brain imaging study\n* upper extremity dysfunction\n* possible to use a simple device\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* delirium, confusion or other evidence related to the consciousness\n* uncontrolled medical or surgical disease\n* unable to command to the order due to severe cognitive impairment\n* visual impairment\n* unable to sit","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nam-Jong Paik, Ph.D","affiliation":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital","city":"Seongnam-si","state":"Gyeonggi-do","zip":"463-707","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.43861,"lon":127.13778}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
