The original test serves as reference method, the swallow endoscopy (FEES) as \"gold standard\".\n\nFurthermore, it will be examined whether the modified Daniels test can be performed by nursing staff. As a reference method, the test will be performed by experienced speech therapists and the swallowing endoscopy (FEES) by speech therapists and/or physicians.","detailedDescription":"For each included patient, the standardized Daniels test is performed by a speech therapist within the first 24 hours after admission, as well as the modified Daniels test by a second speech therapist who is blinded to the result of the first test. This is immediately followed by the administration of the modified Daniels test by a nurse. All investigators are blinded to the results of the preceding water swallow tests. The water swallow tests are not performed by physicians.\n\nFollowing the water swallow tests, FEES is performed by an examiner (physician or speech therapist) experienced in FEES. The examination is digitally recorded and evaluated by an external examiner (physician or speech therapist) using validated scores."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Clinical swallowing exam","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Daniels Water Swallow Test","Diagnostic Test: Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Daniels Water Swallow Test","description":"Clinical water swallow dysphagia screening","armGroupLabels":["Clinical swallowing exam"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing","description":"Endoscopic evaluation of swallowing function","armGroupLabels":["Clinical swallowing exam"],"otherNames":["FEES"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Penetration-Aspiration-Score (PAS) Penetration-Aspiration-Score (PAS)","description":"Penetration-Aspiration-Score, minimum value 1, maximum value 8; higher scores mean worse outcome","timeFrame":"Immediately after the intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Oral Intake Scale-German (FOIS-G)","description":"Functional Oral Intake Scale - German Version; minimum value 1, maximum value 7; higher scores mean better outcome","timeFrame":"Immediately after the intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute (maximum 7 days old) cerebral infarction detected by cMRI or cCT\n* Neurological deficits\n* Written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cerebral hemorrhage\n* Pre-existing swallowing disorders of other etiologies\n* Contraindications to clinical swallowing examination (lack of alertness as well as lack of compliance) - Contradictions to FEES (lack of alertness as well as lack of compliance)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Samra Hamzic, PhD","affiliation":"University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Giessen","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Tobias Braun, MD","affiliation":"University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Giessen","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Giessen","city":"Giesen","state":"Hessen","zip":"35392","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.19716,"lon":9.8989}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
