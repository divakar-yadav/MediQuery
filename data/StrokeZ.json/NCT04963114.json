In the subacute poststroke phase, art therapy is effective in improving depression, self-esteem, and community integration. Yet, no study has explored the effectiveness of art therapy at the chronic stage of a stroke; where motor recovery is slowed, and body image and self-esteem are deeply challenged.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Primary; to assess the feasibility of an art therapy program (ATP) in the chronic phase of stroke. Secondary; to explore the effects of ATP on perceptual impairment (body image/self-esteem), mood and community integration.\n\nMETHOD: Nine adults (stroke ≥6 months) will participate in the ATP consisting of a thematic group visit to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts followed by an art workshop, supervised by an art therapist (7 visits over 4 months). Feasibility will be evaluated by triangulating data from interviews and subject assessment questionnaires and by assessing retention and attendance. The effects of the ATP will be assessed by changes in perceptual and mood impairment questionnaires (Body Image States, Self-Esteem scales, Beck Depression Inventory-Short-Form) and community integration questionnaire (The Community Integration Questionnaire).\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: The project will confirm the feasibility of ATP to improve perceptual impairment and community integration post-stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["art therapy","perceptual impairment","depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Art therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"art therapy in the form of a one-hour guided tour of art works followed by a two-hour guided creative painting workshop on specific themes such as beauty and wonder and colors and emotions","interventionNames":["Behavioral: art therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"art therapy","description":"guided art tour and workshop","armGroupLabels":["Art therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Retention rate to the art therapy program","description":"the number of participants enrolled at the end of the study divided by the number of participants recruited at the beginning of the study","timeFrame":"within 7 days after completion of the art therapy program"},{"measure":"Adherence to the art therapy program","description":"the number of art therapy sessions that participants took part in on a total of 7 visits","timeFrame":"within 7 days after completion of the art therapy program"},{"measure":"Participants' acceptability and perceptions of the effects of the art therapy program","description":"Individualized semi-structured 50-minute interviews and a 2-hour focus group interview, conducted by a research assistant, gathered information on the participants acceptability of the art therapy program and its effects on their perceptual problems, mood and level of activity","timeFrame":"within 7 days after completion of the art therapy program"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in self esteem assessed with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale","description":"The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale: The scale comprises 10 items scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
