In this study, acute stroke patients maximum benefit from the treatment, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) minimizing the errors related to the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients of nursing students from clinical practice guides published on the treatment of It is aimed to be informed and to standardize nursing interventions.","detailedDescription":"Time management in acute stroke patients is possible with a multidisciplinary approach and team members who have received specific training for acute stroke patients. Studies have shown that the maximum result of treatment for acute stroke patients depends on nurses' ability to identify disease symptoms, plan and apply symptom-specific nursing care. There is evidence that the multidisciplinary presence of stroke teams in stroke units and the delivery of coordinated care during the acute phase improve patient outcomes . Coordinated care by the stroke team improves patient outcomes, reduces hospital costs, reduces patient readmission, and improves patient care quality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["tissue plasminogen activator","acute stroke","intravenous tissue plasminogen activator","nursing care","neurology nursing","acute stroke treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Intern nurses will be numbered from 1 to 75 and will be randomly divided into study and control groups from the random numbers table.\n\nAfter the groups are determined by the randomization method, each intern nurse in the study and control groups will be interviewed face to face and their written informed consent will be obtained.
