Cognitive impairment affects a large part of the life of stroke patients. However, the relationship between cognitive impairment and fear of falling in stroke patients has not been investigated in any study yet. Various treatment approaches have been developed to improve cognitive function. While some of these approaches focus on improving cognitive function, others aim to reach the maximum functional level with various compensation methods taught to the patient in the current cognitive situation. As a result of cognitive interventions, stroke patients' participation in daily life, adherence to treatment and quality of life increase. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of cognitive interventions on motor performance, balance and fear of falling. This study will contribute to the literature by investigating these effects of cognitive rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Participants will be randomized into two groups as control and experimental groups. The control group will receive traditional rehabilitation intervention, while the experimental group will receive additional cognitive intervention to traditional rehabilitation. Two groups will be evaluated before and after the study. Participants' motor performance, balance and fear of falling will be determined by evaluation criteria."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognition Disorder","Fear Anxiety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomly divided into intervention and control groups.
