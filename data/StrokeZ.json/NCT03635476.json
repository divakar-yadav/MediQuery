The goal of our proposed project LIFANA is to develop and evaluate the LIFANA Nutrition Solution to support healthy nutrition.. This may include general preferences, such as culture, taste, and budget, but more importantly automated and personalised nutritional recommendations based on advice provided by professional nutritionists and allergists. This is a national project co-funded by the European Union.\n\nOne of the activities of the project is to collect information through a survey with patients. These questions will contribute to creating solutions that can explore the perspectives of patients.","detailedDescription":"Patients will be approached in the clinic by a neurologist and health care professionals. The questionnaire will take place at cereneo. The group will consist of 25 participants and last between 1h. The Survey will be conducted by a clinician who will take notes. Semi-structured discussion guide will be used. With regard to the communication, the moderator will identify factors that will influence communication in a positive or negative way.\n\nThe health professionals will perform content analyses on the transcripts; the schema of categories will be oriented towards the research questions, using open questions, directly addressing quiet participants, and handling the discussion guide in a flexible way."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Relatives","Diet Modification"],"keywords":["Stroke Rehabilitation","Personalized Nutrition","Mobile-Health","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Qualitative interview study","description":"The group in question is part of a research program aimed at developing and evaluating the LIFANA Nutrition Solution, a meal planning recommended system, which suggests meals based on the user's personal profile.
