Only 2-9% of this large number is treated with t-PA if they arrive within 4.5 hours. An equally small percentage of patients with large vessel occlusion undergo thrombectomy.\n\nThe thrombectomy patients may or may not receive t-PA. Some of these patients rarely receive intravenous GPIIB/IIIa inhibitors. Many lines of evidence suggest that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, a class of FDA approved potent platelet inhibitors that have been used extensively along with heparin for acute coronary syndromes (heart attacks) and unstable angina (chest pain), may be safe enough to give in these circumstances.","detailedDescription":"In the past we used 30% lower dose of abciximab compared to the cardiac trials and the discontinued ABESTT stroke trial. There were no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages or thromboyctopenia in our study. Based on the safety and efficacy results (Mandava et al, Translational Stroke Research 2010), we continued its use until manufacture of this agent was stopped.\n\nThere is another compound eptifibatide (Integrilin), that is also a GP IIb/IIIa which is in use in acute coronary syndromes. Eptifibatide has been used by cardiologists since 1998. Reduced doses have been studied along with intravenous rt-PA in stroke patients \\[Pancioli et al 2008 and 2013\\].\n\nWe are proposing even smaller dose compared to Pancioli et al 2008 and 2013. The reduced dose proposed here is less than 1/10th (\\<10%) cardiac dose. For an 80 kg patient the cardiac dose is 244 mg (14 mg bolus followed by an infusion of 230 mg over 24 hours). The reduced dose proposed here for stroke for an 80 kilogram patient is 10 mg bolus followed by an infusion of 10 mg over 24 hours. For patients weighing more than 80 kg the maximum bolus and infusion doses will remain 10 mg each. The cardiac dose does not specify a maximum weight.\n\nIf patients are eligible to receive alteplase as standard of care, patients will be offered alteplase.\n\nPlatelet aggregation has many poorly understood complex roles in ischemic stroke. We are planning on drawing three tubes of blood in addition before and after treatment. The tubes of blood will be collected at the bedside after consent and will be coordinated with the regularly scheduled blood draw that a patient undergoes at presentation to the emergency room. The three tubes of blood will be obtained and tests available in the laboratory will be performed. The three tests are Platelet Function Assay (PFA), Verify-Now (Aspirin) and Verify-Now(Plavix)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Measurement of Platelet function","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke may be given alteplase or other thrombolytic.
