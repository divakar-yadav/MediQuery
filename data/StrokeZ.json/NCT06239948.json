Thus, this research explores the effects of music listening intervention on post-stroke survivors during rehabilitation by using P. Ramlee songs.\n\nMaterials \\& Methods: In the first phase, surveys were conducted to determine the selection of songs to be used in the second phase. The second phase is applying music listening intervention on a small sample of 20 subjects, aged 55 years old and above. The participants were categorized into two groups: stroke survivors and healthy individuals and randomized into control group (without music) and experimental group (with music). The second phase consists of three stages. Stage one is to pre-screen and select potential subjects before the experiment. The second stage aims to determine the effect of P. Ramlee music on stroke survivors during their rehabilitation through augmenting their brain neuroplasticity with measurement of the MEP using TMS. The final stage compares the effects of MEP between lesion and non-lesion areas."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Music Listening","Stroke","Rehabilitation","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","Neuroplasticity","P.
