For the first time, daily walking and other exercise will be monitored by bilateral triaxial accelerometers on the ankles. Activity-recognition algorithms will analyze the inpatient sensor data and return a summary to the participants at each site.","detailedDescription":"Wireless Sensor System The inertial sensor system and activity-recognition algorithms were previously described and tested for short-term reliability. Three sets of triaxial accelerometers (Gulf Coast Data Concepts, Waveland, MS) were mailed to each site's coordinator. Therapists placed one sensor on each ankle before participants got out of bed each morning and removed them once they were in bed at the end of the day; sensor use during weekends was optional. A soft snap band secured each sensor proximal to the medial malleolus, flush against the bony tibia. Every night, sensors were plugged into a local computer to recharge while accelerometer data were uploaded to the central server at UCLA for secure storage and processing. Sensor Calibration and Data Processing In recognition of the variations in gait speed and stand and swing symmetry that occur in patients who need inpatient rehabilitation after stroke, we chose to generate individual templates of each participant's gait from a pair of standardized walks. On study entry participants performed two stopwatch- timed 10-meter walks at self-selected casual and safest fast walking speeds. A hybrid classifier employing dynamic time warping and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms generated statistical models of each participant's gait based on the two walks. Repeat walks were performed and the templates updated weekly for the remainder of each participant's rehabilitation stay to account for expected changes in gait parameters."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, gait, walking, disability","wireless inertial sensing","mobile health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Augmented activity feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Feedback three times per week about 10-m walking speed, plus amount and types of physical activity measured using wireless bilateral ankle sensors that detect bouts of walking and cycling speed, duration, and distance.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Augmented activity feedback"]},{"label":"speed-only feedback","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Feedback three times per week about overground walking speed over 10 meters.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speed-only feedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Augmented activity feedback","description":"Feedback about walking speed and amount of physical activity will be provided 3 times per week from data acquired from wireless sensors on each ankle.","armGroupLabels":["Augmented activity feedback"],"otherNames":["accelerometry","hemiparetic stroke","mobile health","wireless health","feedback about performance","physical therapy for stroke rehabilitation","locomotion"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Speed-only feedback","description":"Feedback about walking speed will be provided 3 times per week.","armGroupLabels":["speed-only feedback"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait speed","timeFrame":"Discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Distance walked in 3 minutes","timeFrame":"Discharge"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Admission for acute inpatient rehabilitation of a first stroke (or second stroke after full recovery from prior TIA/Stroke)\n* Time from onset of stroke to admission for rehabilitation \\< 35 days\n* Stroke from any cause (thrombotic infarct, cardioembolus, intracerebral hemorrhage) that includes unilateral hemiparesis.
