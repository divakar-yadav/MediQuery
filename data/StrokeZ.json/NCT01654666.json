As the extent of its effect is unknown, the investigators will use clinical outcome, serum biochemical markers and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine whether RIPC has neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory effects on patients undergoing carotid artery stenting.","detailedDescription":"BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury contributed to perioperative morbidity and mortality in Carotid Artery Stenting. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion, can provide systemic protection for prolonged ischemia. Our previous study found no significant protection to the patients who received once RIPC before Carotid Artery Stenting. In order to investigate whether long-term RIPC before Carotid Artery Stenting can protect these patients from the perioperative and long-term complications, a prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed in the current study.\n\nDESIGNING: About 189 patients who are eligible for carotid artery stenting will be randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to RIPC group, sham RIPC group and conventional Carotid Artery Stenting group (control). Remote limb ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is consisted of five 5-min cycles of bilateral arm ischemia/reperfusion, it is induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on bilateral arm and inflated to 200 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflating the cuff for 5-min, patients in the RIPC group will do it twice a day for at least two weeks before carotid artery stenting. Patients in the sham RIPC group receive sham RIPC treatment, which is consisted of five 5-min cycles of bilateral arm ischemia/reperfusion, induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on bilateral arm and inflated to 60 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflating the cuff for 5-min, they will do it twice a day for at least two weeks before carotid artery stenting. Patients in the control group receive conventional carotid artery stenting without RIPC or sham RIPC treatment. Cerebral injury is assessed by serum S-100B and Neuron specific enolase (NSE), systematic inflammation is assessed by serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Post-treatment infarctions, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are detected by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and clinical outcomes are determined by cerebrovascular events, cardiac events or death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Stenosis"],"keywords":["Remote ischemic preconditioning","Stroke secondary prevention","Carotid artery stenting","Carotid stenosis","Inflammation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":189,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIPC group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment:Patients in this group received standard medical therapy and remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) treatment.\n\nDevice:RIPC consisted of five 5-min cycles of bilateral arm ischemia/reperfusion, which is induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on bilateral arm and inflated to 200 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflating the cuff for 5-min,each patient in the RIPC group do it twice a day for at least two weeks before carotid artery stenting.\n\nProcedure: Carotid Artery Stenting","interventionNames":["Procedure: Remote ischemic preconditioning","Procedure: Carotid Artery Stenting"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Treatment:Patients in this group received standard medical therapy alone.
