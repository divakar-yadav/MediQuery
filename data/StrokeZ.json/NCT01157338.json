In this study the investigators evaluate the incidence of retinal emboli post diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization over 300 patients. The incidence was 6.3% and had no clinical sequel on visual acuity and visual field.","detailedDescription":"Background and Purpose Cardiac catheterization may cause retinal embolization, a risk factor for cerebrovascular emboli and stroke. We describe the incidence of clinically silent and apparent retinal emboli following diagnostic and interventional coronary catheterization and associated risk factors.\n\nMethods Three hundred selected patients attending a tertiary referral center for diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization were studied. Direct retinal examination and examination of the visual field and acuity were done before and after catheterization by a retinal specialist."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Catheterization","Retina","Embolism"],"keywords":["Catheter","coronary artery disease","embolus","stroke","retinal emboli"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"diagnostic cardiac catheterization","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients with diagnostic cardiac catheterization","interventionNames":["Procedure: diagnostic cardiac catheterization"]},{"label":"therapeutic cardiac catheterization","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patient with angioplasty","interventionNames":["Procedure: therapeutic cardiac catheterization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"diagnostic cardiac catheterization","description":"coronary intervention: angiography","armGroupLabels":["diagnostic cardiac catheterization"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"therapeutic cardiac catheterization","description":"cardiac catheterization: angioplasty","armGroupLabels":["therapeutic cardiac catheterization"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"retinal emboli","description":"retinal emboli detected by retinal especialist by direct examination"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"visual field","description":"visual field detected by ophthalmologist"},{"measure":"visual acuity","description":"snellen chart by ophthalmologist"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* every patient with diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient refusal to follow up ophthalmology\n* abscence of coronary disease in angiogram\n* abnormal retinal angiogram prior to study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"52 Years","maximumAge":"68 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"shiraz University of medical sciences","city":"Shiraz","state":"Fars","zip":"55318","country":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":29.61031,"lon":52.53113}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21255443","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Kojuri J, Mehdizadeh M, Rostami H, Shahidian D.
