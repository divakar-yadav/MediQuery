To the investors knowledge this is never been demonstrated.","detailedDescription":"Fifty healthy subjects will execute a reaching movement in sitting. They will reach to a cone at a distance of little more than armlength.\n\nElectromyogram (EMG) and kinematics will be the outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures are: sex, dexterity, skillfulness, Fifty first time stroke patients will execute the same movements. Primery outcome is EMG and kinematics; secundary outcome measures are: side of hemiplegia, arm recuperation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Trunk Stability"],"keywords":["stroke","reaching","ADL"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"healthy subjects","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"healthy subjects","interventionNames":["Other: one time testing"]},{"label":"stroke patients","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"first time stroke patients"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"one time testing","armGroupLabels":["healthy subjects"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Electromyography to analyze muscle activation","description":"which muscle is active during a reaching movement","timeFrame":"2 hours"},{"measure":"kinematics to analyze trunk involvement","description":"when is the trunk involved in a reaching movement","timeFrame":"2 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* BMI \\< 30\n* no orthopedic, neurologic disorder that can influence the reaching\n* age between 18 and 70 yrs\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* BMI\\>30\n* orthopedic, neurologic disorder that can influence the reaching\n* \\< 18 yrs of age\n* \\>70 yrs of age","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Revaki Ugent","city":"Gent","state":"Oost Vlaanderen","zip":"9000","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05,"lon":3.71667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000004198","term":"Disease Susceptibility"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7070","name":"Disease Susceptibility","asFound":"Predisposition","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
