Previous studies showed that intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) is a reasonable alternative to alteplase for all patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke who meet standard criteria for thrombolysis. After thrombolysis-induced recanalisation, reocclusion occurs in 14-34% of patients, probably because of platelet activation. Early administration of antiplatelet therapy after intravenous thrombolysis could reduce the risk of reocclusion and improve outcome. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of early administration of tirofiban in patients treated with tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase plus Tirofiban","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg, administered as a bolus over \\~10 seconds).
