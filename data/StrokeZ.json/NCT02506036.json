Spouses and caregivers often cite these symptoms as a major concern, and these deficits can have a negative impact on the quality of life that patients experience. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not web-based social training exercises can improve social-cognitive impairments in patients with FTD or right hemisphere stroke. These training exercises have been shown to improve social skills and empathy in other disorders. This study will be the first to examine if these exercises can be effective and feasible for treating social deficits in stroke and FTD.\n\nThe study will be based out of the Johns Hopkins Hospital where patients will be assessed three times in total. Patients will be assessed upon enrollment in the study and after each of the two treatment conditions. The training itself will be completed at home on a provided laptop, with monitoring and support by the study team. This study uses a crossover design, which means that all patients will receive the training treatment and a control treatment during their participation in the study. The approximate timeline for the study is 9 weeks total."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Frontotemporal Dementia","Right Sided Cerebral Hemisphere Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Treatment","Social-Cognitive Training","Web-based","Right Hemisphere Stroke","Frontotemporal Dementia","Right Sided Cerebral Hemisphere Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control then Social Cognitive Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients assigned to this arm will first receive a control therapy on a laptop followed by the Brain HQ social-cognitive training.","interventionNames":["Other: Brain HQ"]},{"label":"Social Cognitive Training then Control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients assigned to this arm will first receive the Brain HQ social-cognitive training and then undergo a control therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Brain HQ"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Brain HQ","description":"Brain HQ is a web application that will be used to provide patients with a training intervention that addresses deficits in social-emotional functions.
