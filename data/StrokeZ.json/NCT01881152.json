The clusters are the four communities of the Area Vasta Emilia Nord, AVEN (Parma, Piacenza, Modena e Reggio Emilia). As analysis Units, we will consider the patients consecutively admitted to the six participating hospitals throughout the study period, for suspected stroke or transitory ischemic attack (TIA).","detailedDescription":"After a baseline 3 month period, the educational campaign will be sequentially launched in the four communities over four 3 month periods, according to a computer-generated list. The comparison will be the\"usual care\".\n\nPrimary outcome measures: The proportion of patients arriving at the Emergency Department (ED) with suspected stroke or TIA within two hours.\n\nSecondary outcome measures: the proportion of patients with confirmed stroke or TIA diagnosis; the proportion of ischemic stroke patients evaluated for recominanat Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rTPA) therapy; the proportion of patients treated with rTPA; time interval between arrival at the ED and CT scan; for patients treated with rTPA, time interval between arrival at the ED and therapy initiation (door to needle time); death and disability (assessed as modified Rankin Score 3-5) at 1 and 3 month from stroke onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Community education","Awareness","Prehospital delay"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1772,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Educational campaign","interventionNames":["Other: Educational campaign"]},{"label":"Control","type":"OTHER","description":"Usual care","interventionNames":["Other: Usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Educational campaign","description":"Multilevel educational campaign on stroke sympton recognition and the need for calling the Emergency Services","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"],"otherNames":["Community campaign","Public campaign"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual care","description":"Information on stroke usually delivered at the community level.","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of early admission","description":"Proportion of patients arriving to the Emergency Department with suspected stroke or TIA within two hours","timeFrame":"Time interval from stroke onset to arrival at the Emergency Department"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Poor outcome at 1 month","description":"Death or disability (modified Rankin Scale 3-6)at 1 month","timeFrame":"1 month from stroke onset"},{"measure":"Poor outcome at 3 months","description":"Death or disability (modified Rankin Scale 3-6) at 3 months","timeFrame":"3 months from stroke onset"},{"measure":"Rate of thrombolysis","description":"Proportion of patients given thrombolysis","timeFrame":"Up to 4 hours and 30 minutes from stroke onset"},{"measure":"Rate of thrombolysis activation","description":"Proportion of patients evaluated for thrombolysis","timeFrame":"Up to 3 hours from stroke onset"},{"measure":"Delay in CT scan","description":"Time interval between arrival at the Emergency Department and CT scan","timeFrame":"Up to 12 hours from admission at the ED"},{"measure":"Door to needle time","description":"Time interval between arrival at the ED and thrombolysis initiation","timeFrame":"Up to 4 hours and 30 minutes from stroke onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients consecutively admitted to the six participating hospitals for suspected stroke or transitory ischemic attack (TIA), defined as abrupt onset of focal or generalized neurologic deficit of vascular origin.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No information available on the time of stroke onset.\n* No informed consent from patient or caregiver","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Licia Denti, MD","affiliation":"Parma University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"AUSL Parma","city":"Fidenza","zip":"43016","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.86694,"lon":10.06039}},{"facility":"Ospedale Civile S.
