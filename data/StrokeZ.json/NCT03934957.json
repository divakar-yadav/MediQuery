Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting cardiac, arterio-venous and cerebral function and structure including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes self-ratings of life style and environmental conditions, , dietary habits, physical activity, professional life, psychosocial context, , digital media use, medical and family history as well as health care utilization patterns. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging data and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia will be invited for a visit to conduct additional MRI examination either of heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and data from involved health and pension insurances."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Heart Disease","Stroke","Dementia","Cancer","Health Care","Vascular Diseases","Periodontal Diseases","Ocular Diseases","Respiratory Disease","Obesity"],"keywords":["Epidemiology","prospective cohort study","Nutrition","prevention","psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"serum, plasma (EDTA, citrate), genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) from whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), blood cells (erythrocytes, PBMCs), urine, saliva, tooth fluid, tonsils swabs"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"self-reported Information on changes in health in the participants","description":"coronary artery disease atrial fibrillation heart failure dementia stroke cancer such as prostate cancer and skin cancer chronic kidney diseases migraine musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoporosis and bone metastasis ocular diseases such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, fundus hypertonicus, retinal vessel disease and neoplasm oral health including periodontal disease, oropharyngeal cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders such as mental disorder or late - last depression pulmonary diseases such as obstructive lung disease sexual disorder skin diseases such as psoriasis, chronic wounds and inflammation vascular diseases such as aortic aneurysm, thrombosis and peripheral arterial disease","timeFrame":"yearly up to 12 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inhabitant of the city of Hamburg at the time of inclusion into the study (Inclusion is time of written consent)\n* Age 45 to 74 years\n* Personally signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Insufficient knowledge of the German language, in order to understand study documents and computer assisted interview without translation\n* Physical or psychological incapability to travel to the study center and to cooperate in the investigations","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"74 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Population based cohort, participants are identified by a random sample from the official inhabitant data file divided into gender and six age strata.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Annika Jagodzinski, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0049741059328","email":"A.Jagodzinski@uke.de"},{"name":"Tanja Zeller, Professor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0049741056045","email":"t.zeller@uke.de"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Stefan Blankenberg, Professor","affiliation":"Universitäres Herzzentrum Hamburg","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hamburg","zip":"20246","country":"Germany","contacts":[{"name":"Susannw Bruder","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00494056045","email":"s.bruder@uke.de"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":53.57532,"lon":10.01534}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36126126","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Cavus E, Schneider JN, Bei der Kellen R, di Carluccio E, Ziegler A, Tahir E, Bohnen S, Avanesov M, Radunski UK, Chevalier C, Jahnke C, Ojeda F, Kirchhof P, Blankenberg S, Adam G, Lund GK, Muellerleile K.
