It may cause aspiration, poor nutrition or even pneumonia; thus, it is crucial for the physicians to evaluate the swallowing function of the stroke patients. However, the evaluation methods nowadays still have some limitations. Water swallowing test is one of the well-known methods, but the test itself would put the patients at risk of aspiration. Furthermore, in order to increase the sensitivity of the water swallowing test, the amount of the water should also be increased; as a consequence, the risk of aspiration will also increase. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of the swallowing and videofluoroscopy have limitations of invasiveness. The laryngeal ultrasound to evaluate the vocal cord movement can be an alternative method, having the characteristics of non-invasiveness and repeat evaluation.\n\nThe investigators aim to evaluate the vocal cord movement in patients with acute stroke by ultrasound. The occurrence of choking or aspiration pneumonia will be collected in one year after the index stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"vocal cord movement among the stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: ultrasound"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"ultrasound","description":"evaluate the vocal cord movement among the stroke patients","armGroupLabels":["vocal cord movement among the stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the incidence of aspiration pneumonia","timeFrame":"one year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute stroke (in one month) patients\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with stroke occurring more than one month ago","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Wan-Ching Lien","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886223123456","email":"wanchinglien@ntu.edu.tw"},{"name":"Wan-Ching Lien","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886988088719","email":"dtemer17@yahoo.com.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Wan-Ching Lien","affiliation":"National Taiwan University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Wan-Ching Lien","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taipei","state":"None Selected","zip":"100","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Wan-Ching Lien","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886223123456","email":"wanchinglien@ntu.edu.tw"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Acute Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6557","name":"Decompression Sickness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
