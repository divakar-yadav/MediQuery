A single-blind, phase II, 3-site randomized controlled trial has been planned. Fifty persons \\>6 months post stroke will randomize to either moderate-intensity aerobic locomotor training or high-intensity interval locomotor training; each for 45 minutes, 3x/week for up to 36 total sessions over approximately 12 weeks. Clinical measures of walking function, aerobic fitness, daily walking activity and quality of life will be assessed at baseline (PRE) and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of training (POST-4WK, POST-8WK, POST-12WK)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Locomotion","Aerobic","Intensity","Dosing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Training"]},{"label":"High-Intensity Interval Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: High-Intensity Interval Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Training","description":"Overground and treadmill walking with speed continuously adjusted to maintain a target heart rate of 40 +/- 5% heart rate reserve, progressing up to 55 +/- 5% heart rate reserve.","armGroupLabels":["Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"High-Intensity Interval Training","description":"Overground and treadmill walking with 30 second bursts at maximum speed alternated with 30-60 second passive recovery periods.
