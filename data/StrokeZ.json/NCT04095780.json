Oral opportunistic pathogens have been reported to be associated with the incidence of pneumonia among non-stroke immunocompromised subjects. Preliminary studies found that patients with stroke had higher carriage rates of oral opportunistic pathogens than healthy subjects. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that pneumonia complicating stroke is associated with oral opportunistic pathogens, and oral health promotion interventions may reduce the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke via its effects on the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic pathogens. In order to prove this, investigators need to (1) firstly conduct a randomized controlled trial to confirm whether oral health promotion is able to reduce the levels of plaque, and the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke at clinical level; (2) secondly employ metagenomics analysis to compare oral rinse samples and respiratory samples, and to identify pneumonia-associated \"oral opportunistic pathogens group\"; (3) finally elucidate how oral health promotion influences the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic pathogens. This proposed study will provide evidence for the integration of oral health promotion as part of interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Pneumonia","Oral Hygiene"],"keywords":["Oral opportunistic pathogens","Oral health promotion","Pneumonia complicating stroke","Metagenome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":166,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Advanced oral hygiene care programme","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with stroke will receive the advanced oral hygiene care programme (AOHCP) comprising powered tooth brushing and mouth rinsing with chlorhexidine (with a supply of standardized power tooth brushes, mouth rinse, tooth paste and oral hygiene instruction).","interventionNames":["Other: Advanced oral hygiene care programme"]},{"label":"Oral hygiene instruction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with stroke will only receive the oral hygiene instruction.","interventionNames":["Other: Oral hygiene instruction"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Advanced oral hygiene care programme","description":"1.
