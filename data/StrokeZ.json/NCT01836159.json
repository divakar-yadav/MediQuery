There are also limited interventions are available for home use after discharge from a rehabilitation centre. Hence, there is now a need to determine the feasibility of innovative strategies for home use, to cover the gap after discharge from rehabilitation institutions.\n\niHOME is an original, low cost, potentially high impact intervention to fulfil this gap. If proven to be effective, the use of tablet technology has a broad range of potential outcomes and benefits. The anticipated public benefit is for stroke patients to be able to potentially employ the iPad, an accessible technological device, as an expansion of rehabilitation in an in-home setting.\n\niHOME is a pilot randomized controlled trial with a blinded outcome assessment. The trial is subdivided into iHOME Acute and iHOME Chronic, where patients have had a stroke less than 3 months or more than 6 months ago, respectively, at the time of randomization. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the interventions arms (i.e. the investigational and control group)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fine Motor Function Deficit and Visual Neglect Post-stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke Rehabilitation","iPad","Fine Motor Function","Ischemic Stroke","Visual Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard/ Usual Care","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients may receive outpatient rehabilitation as required as part of usual/standard care.
