For this study, the investigators would like to determine if and the extent of finger proprioception can be improved through targeted robotic proprioceptive training combined with robotic finger movement training. The investigators would also include imagining studies via Electroencephalogram (EEG) and other baseline predictors to provide insight to determine who responds best to proprioceptive training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Randomized single-blinded","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants with undergo new FINGER robotic training with no physical assistance 3 times a week for a period of 3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: New FINGER"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will undergo new FINGER robotic training with physical assistance 3 times a week for a period of 3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: New FINGER"]},{"label":"Group C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will undergo new FINGER robotic training with physical assistance and proprioceptive exercises 3 times a week for a period of 3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: New FINGER"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"New FINGER","description":"New FINGER exoskeleton is a robotic device that can provide assistance and resistance to thumb and finger movement","armGroupLabels":["Group A","Group B","Group C"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Box and Blocks Test","description":"We compare the change of Box and Block Test scores from baseline evaluation to 1-month post intervention.

Finger proprioception is measured by using the FINGER Crisscross Assessment which we slowly move the index and middle fingers with the FINGER robot past each other without any visual input. We then ask study participants to press a key when they feel the fingers are overlapped. Finger proprioception is measured by the error which will be quantified as the mean magnitude of finger separation error at the metacarpal joint when the key is pressed. The lower scores indicate a better outcome.","timeFrame":"From baseline to 1-month post intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 to 85 years\n* Suffered from a single ischemic stroke (radiologically confirmed) at least 6-months prior to enrollment\n* An ability to score at least 3 blocks on the Box and Block Test\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A substantial decrease in alertness, language reception or attention\n* Pregnant or lactating\n* Advanced liver, kidney, cardiac or pulmonary disease\n* Plan to alter any current participation in other rehabilitation therapy in the time period of the study\n* A terminal medical diagnosis consistent with survival \\< 1 year\n* Coexistent major neurological disease\n* Coexistent major psychiatric disease\n* A history of significant alcohol or drug abuse in the prior 3 years\n* Current enrollment in another study related to stroke or stroke recovery\n* Any other medical contraindication to participation in this study evaluated by our team physician.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Vicky Chan, PT, DPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(949) 824-8423","email":"vchan2@uci.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"David Reinkensmeyer, Ph.D","affiliation":"University of California, Irvine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of California Irvine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Irvine","state":"California","zip":"92697","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Vicky Chan, DPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"949-824-8423","email":"vchan2@uci.edu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.66946,"lon":-117.82311}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28803535","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Rowe JB, Chan V, Ingemanson ML, Cramer SC, Wolbrecht ET, Reinkensmeyer DJ.
