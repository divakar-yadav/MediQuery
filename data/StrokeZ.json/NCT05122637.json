RapidPulseTM Aspiration System as frontline approach for use in the treatment of patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) due to Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO). This is a prospective, multi-center, open label study comparing the safety and performance of the RapidPulseTM Aspiration System with non-randomized retrospective controls who otherwise meet the same study inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study will enroll a maximum of 100 participants in the Treatment Arm and a maximum of 200 participants in the Control Arm at in up to 10 centers in Europe and/or Latin America. Subjects data will be collected through hospitalization with a 3 months post-procedure study visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Large vessel occlusion","Mechanical thrombectomy","Neurovascular intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RapidPulseTM Aspiration System with commercially available Medtronic React 71 aspiration catheter and commercially available aspiration pump as frontline approach thrombectomy technique.","interventionNames":["Device: RapidPulseTM Aspiration System"]},{"label":"Control Arm","type":"OTHER","description":"Treatment with commercially available aspiration catheter with commercially available aspiration pump as frontline approach thrombectomy technique.","interventionNames":["Device: Standard of Care Aspiration Thrombectomy System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RapidPulseTM Aspiration System","description":"The RapidPulseTM Aspiration System with Medtronic React 71 aspiration catheter and a commercially available pump.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Arm"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Standard of Care Aspiration Thrombectomy System","description":"Commercially available aspiration catheter with commercially available aspiration pump","armGroupLabels":["Control Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"First Pass Reperfusion Effect (FPE)","description":"Defined by modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction scale (mTICI 2c-3) flow in the target vessel","timeFrame":"Intra-procedural"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frontline technical success","description":"Defined by mTICI ≥ 2b after the last pass with Study Device with no rescue therapy","timeFrame":"Intra-procedural"},{"measure":"Good functional outcome measured by Modified Rankin Scale score of 0 -
