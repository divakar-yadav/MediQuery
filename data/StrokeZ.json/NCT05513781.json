Although the presence of weakness or spasticity in the quadriceps muscle, weakness or spasticity in the plantar flexors, and weakness of the dorsiflexors, hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscle are shown in the literature as the cause of hyperextension of the affected knee in hemiplegic patients, there is a comprehensive study that shows the effect of both muscle strength and spasticity in the lower extremity muscles. there are no studies.\n\nThe hypotheses of the study are:\n\nHypothesis 1:\n\nH0: There is no relationship between knee hyperextension in the stance phase of gait and lower extremity muscle strength in stroke patients.\n\nH1: There is a relationship between knee hyperextension in the stance phase of gait and lower extremity muscle strength in stroke patients.\n\nHypothesis 2; H0: There is no relationship between knee hyperextension in the stance phase of gait and lower extremity spasticity in stroke patients.\n\nH1: There is a relationship between knee hyperextension in the stance phase of gait and lower extremity spasticity in stroke patients.\n\nHypothesis 3; H0: There is no relationship between knee hyperextension and electromyographic muscle activations in chronic stroke patients.\n\nH1: There is a relationship between knee hyperextension and electromyographic muscle activations in chronic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait Analysis","Stroke","Knee Hyperextension","Electromyography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chronic stroke patients with knee hyperextension"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Movement Analysis","description":"Reflective signs will be placed at certain anatomical points of the participants.

Then it will be examined in computer environment using Blade software.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Electromyographic Measurements","description":"Electromyography (EMG) is frequently used in the literature for motion analysis evaluations. It shows the amplitude of the electrical activity of the muscles. In this study, 8-channel Delsys Bagnoli desktop cable electromyography system (Delsys (Delsys Inc., USA)) will be used. EMG; It shows whether the muscles are active during movement, when they are active and how active they are. In this study, the muscles to be measured by EMG: tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, medial hamstrings, rectus femoris, gluteus medius and the lower part of the latismus dorsi are planned.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Muscle Strength Evaluation","description":"Manual muscle testing will be performed on patients' hip flexors, hip extensors, hip abductors, hip adductors, knee flexors, knee extensors, dorsiflexors, and plantar flexors. A score between 0 and 5 will be given according to the manual muscle test, the ability of the muscles to move against gravity in certain positions, and the resistance of the movement against gravity.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Spasticity Evaluation","description":"The spasticity of the lower extremity muscles (quadriceps, hip extensors, hip adductors, hip internal retractors and plantar flexors) will be evaluated according to the Modified Ashworth Scale.
