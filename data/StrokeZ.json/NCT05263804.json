Stroke is characterized by a cerebral parenchymal lesion due to an ischemic mechanism (85% of the cases) or hemorrhagic mechanism (15%). For a long time, the only approved treatment was the intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA). Recently, thrombectomy has proven its superiority in this pathology.\n\nCohorts of patients with stroke are rare but can be very valuable by their clinical, laboratory and imaging well documented. They are the source of new hypotheses for research or interventions as well as the quality of care assessment tool.\n\nThe main objective of this project is to identify new markers: biological and imaging, treatment response and prognosis after ischemic stroke.\n\nSecondary objectives of the HIBISCUS-STROKE II cohort are to establish a clinical database, completed by biological samples and by imaging data that can be used in the following areas:\n\nDescriptive epidemiology of ischemic stroke and cerebral reperfusion, Pharmacoepidemiology and treatments observatory: safety, efficacy, indication of treatment in real life, costs Assessment of the long-term effect of the treatment on the occurrence of disability, stroke recurrence and death, Quality of life and personal, familial, professional and social consequences of stroke, Research of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, Research projects.\n\nAncillary study :\n\nCardiac complications are the second leading cause of death after stroke. A close relationship between brain damage and heart complications, referred to as \"neuro-cardiac syndrome\" has been established. 20% of patients admitted for ischemic stroke present at least one major cardiac event, including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and / or cardiac arrhythmia, within three months of the event, while 28% have a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear and the therapeutic targets unknown. To study these mechanisms, an ancillary study will be proposed to patient whom accepted to participate in the main project research.\n\nThe general objective of the ancillary study is to identify early markers of cardiac damage during ischemic stroke having benefited from mechanical recanalization by thrombectomy, and to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology at the origin of cardiac complications in the course of an ischemic stroke with the final objective of identifying new therapeutic targets."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Stroke","Bio-collection","Imaging markers","Biomarkers","Clinical outcomes","Myocardial damages"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort group","type":"OTHER","description":"Patient over 18 with an ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: Collection of blood samples and MRI imaging in order to create a bio- and imaging-collection"]},{"label":"Ancillary study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient over 18 with an ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: Cardiac MRI with gadolinium injection - Ancillary Study"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Collection of blood samples and MRI imaging in order to create a bio- and imaging-collection","description":"No intervention.
