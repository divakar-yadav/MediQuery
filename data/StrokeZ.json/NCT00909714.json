Every year 200 000 to 250 000 patients suffer a stroke in Germany. Only a small number of the stroke survivors recover to a degree that allows them to return into their professional and private life. Despite significant efforts to develop novel and efficient treatment strategies the level of functional regeneration is still not satisfying. Thus, the development of innovative and effective treatment strategies will have a major impact for the patients' life, the society and the public health system.\n\nWithin the proposed project an innovative, non-invasive and cost effective interventional strategy, based on the combination of a specific rehabilitative training and brain stimulation by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), will be used to enhance functional regeneration in stroke patients. The intervention will be applied in an early stage in which plasticity, cortical reorganization and functional improvement is most pronounced. We hypothesize that the combination of anodal tDCS delivered to the motor cortex of the affected hemisphere combined with training over a period of two weeks in the subacute stage after stroke will significantly enhance cortical plasticity, functional regeneration and long-term outcome determined by clinical and functional outcome measures compared with Placebo stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","non-invasive cortical stimulation","motor recovery","cortical
