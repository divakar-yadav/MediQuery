According to the psychological assessment, patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not there was a PSD at the earlier stage of stroke. Clinical biological data and blood and feces samples were collected. Firstly, 16srDNA sequencing was used to study the difference in the composition and diversity of intestinal microbial communities in the two groups of patients. Then the two groups selected individual representative samples and conducted macro genome sequencing. At the same time, by analyzing the correlation between the intestinal flora and the clinical risk factors and neurotransmitters in early PSD patients, the key functional bacteria related to PSD were identified."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","depression","intestinal microbiota"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with poststroke depression","description":"No intervention"},{"label":"Patients without poststroke depression","description":"No intervention"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Composition of Intestinal Microbial Communities Calculated by OTU Analysis","description":"The composition were measured in number based on OTU data","timeFrame":"2 weeks"},{"measure":"The Diversity of Intestinal Microbial Communities Calculated by OTU Analysis","description":"Community diversity measured in the Shannon index","timeFrame":"2 weeks"},{"measure":"The Poststroke Depression Assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) Score","description":"Mild depression（HAMD-17 Score\\>7，≤17）, moderate depression（HAMD-17 Score\\>17，≤24）, major depression（HAMD-17 Score\\>24）","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Functional Independence Assessed by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS）score","description":"MRS score range from 0 to 6.
