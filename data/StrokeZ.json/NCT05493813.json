To assess the outcome of both modalities, the sedation depth of GA will be regulated with processed electroencephalogram monitor to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium and the peri-procedural blood pressure will be controlled according to the guideline.Based on that, the investigators try to find a better general anesthetic modality for acute ischemic stroke participants undergoing EVT.","detailedDescription":"1. In 2019, cerebrovascular disease (i.e., stroke) was the second leading cause of death worldwide.\n2. The present guidelines for the early management of the participants with acute ischemic stroke urge the in-time and early application of intravenous chemical thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) due to better outcome and prognosis. \"Timing is brain.\"\n3. The participants with acute ischemic stroke, previous stroke, and severe stroke have high incidence of delirium, and the stroke-related delirium has been shown to correlate with higher morbidity and mortality.\n4. Researches on the anesthetic management during EVT for acute ischemic stroke have shown that both general anesthesia and sedation anesthesia are safe and without difference in neurological outcome and long-term complications. However, general anesthesia might have higher rates in revascularization in EVT for acute ischemic stroke as compared with sedation anesthesia.\n5. Anesthesia could produce postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) or delirium (POD), and general anesthesia could produce higher rates of POCD and POD compared to general anesthesia and sedation anesthesia. Additionally, brain injury and acute ischemic stroke are independent risk factors for POCD and POD. Whether the anesthetic management for EVT would interfere with the acute ischemic stroke-produced POCD and/or POD or even delay the detection and treatment of stroke-related neurological impairment deserves investigation since EVT is the gold standard for acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute","Thrombectomy","General Anesthesia","Total Intravenous Anesthesia","Postoperative Delirium","Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","general anesthesia","total intravenous anesthesia","postoperative delirium","postoperative cognitive dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study is a prospective, single-centered, double-blind, randomized control trial at Taipei Veterans General Hospital.
