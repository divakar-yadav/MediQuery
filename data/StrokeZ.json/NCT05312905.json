The original test consists of 49 items encompassing 12 domains.

Eight factors are rated to produce an overall score on a point scale of 0 to 100. Then, an assignment is given as \"excellent\" for 95 to 100 points; \"good\" for 84 to 94 points, \"fair\" for 65 to 83 points, or \"poor\" for less than 65 points, higher scores indicating better function.","timeFrame":"changes after 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"The modified Ashworth scale is a muscle tone assessment scale used to assess the resistance experienced during passive range of motion, which does not require any instrumentation and is quick to perform.This scale grades the muscle tone from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe spasticity).
