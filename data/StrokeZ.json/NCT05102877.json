Electrical stimulation is often included as part of the treatment plan for dysphagia, and can be applied at a sensory or motor level intensity. However, evidence to support sensory versus motor stimulation is lacking. This study compares the effect of sensory and motor stimulation on post-stroke dysphagia.\n\nDesign: Randomized controlled trial\n\nSetting: Inpatient rehabilitation facility.\n\nParticipants: Participants (50-75 years of age) who had dysphagia caused by a stroke within 6 months prior to enrollment were included. Participants were excluded if they had a contraindication for electrical stimulation, previous stroke, psychiatric disorder, contraindications for MBS, or pre-stroke swallowing disorders.\n\nInterventions: Each patient received ten, 45-minute anterior neck sensory or motor level electrical stimulation sessions in addition to standard speech therapy. Motor stimulation was administered as a stimulus intensity sufficient to produce muscle contractions. Sensory stimulation was defined as the threshold when the patient feels a tingling sensation on their skin (approximately 4-5mA).\n\nMain Outcome Measures: Swallow FIM, National Outcome Measurement System (NOMS), Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS), and change in modified diet."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Dysphagia","Swallow","Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory level stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ten, 45-minute anterior neck sensory level electrical stimulation sessions in addition to traditional dysphagia therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation"]},{"label":"Motor level stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ten, 45-minute anterior neck sensory level electrical stimulation sessions in addition to traditional dysphagia therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation","description":"Motor stimulation was administered at an intensity sufficient to produce muscle contractions.
