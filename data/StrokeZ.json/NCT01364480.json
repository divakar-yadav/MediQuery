Brain-machine interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural signals are generated even though they are not sent to the arms, hands and legs. By implanting electrodes in the brain, individuals can be trained to send neural signals which are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then be used to control a variety of devices or computer displays."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tetraplegia","Spinal Cord Injury"],"keywords":["Tetraplegia","Spinal cord injury","Brainstem or spinal stroke","Neuroprosthetic","Brain-machine interface","Brain-computer interface","Neural activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Brain-Machine Interface Users","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants enrolled in the study will undergo Implantation of NeuroPort Arrays in the motor cortex.
