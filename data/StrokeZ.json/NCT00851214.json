It is not known what the underlying continuous cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, etc are in these patients and how these change with current Emergency Medicine therapeutic interventions. Currently there is available a finger cuff devise (NexfinHD Monitor, BMEYE, Amsterdam) that can measure these hemodynamics on a beat to beat basis and that can be easily applied to acutely ill individuals. This prospective pilot study of 48 patients (4 groups of 12 each) will document the hemodynamics of patients on arrival and continuously for 2 hours, blinded to the treating physician. Treating physicians will be asked to estimate these hemodynamic parameters at various time points. The study will characterize the hemodynamics of patients, compare them to the estimates of treating physicians and determine whether they predict the need for life saving interventions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COPD","Congestive Heart Failure","Trauma","Sepsis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring","Emergency Department patients","trauma with an ISS>15","Non-invasive continuous hemodynamic monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute CHF/COPD","description":"Patients presenting with shortness of breath secondary to acute exacerbation of CHF/COPD","interventionNames":["Device: NexfinHD Monitor"]},{"label":"Acute Trauma","description":"Acute trauma patients with a trauma ISS\\>15","interventionNames":["Device: NexfinHD Monitor"]},{"label":"Sepsis","description":"Patients presenting with a suspicion of acute sepsis (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea)","interventionNames":["Device: NexfinHD Monitor"]},{"label":"Stroke","description":"Patients presenting with symptoms and signs of acute stroke (thrombotic or hemorrhagic)","interventionNames":["Device: NexfinHD Monitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NexfinHD Monitor","description":"Finger cuff device (NexfinHD Monitor, BMEYE, Amsterdam) that can measure hemodynamics on a beat to beat basis and that can be easily applied to acutely ill individuals.","armGroupLabels":["Acute CHF/COPD","Acute Trauma","Sepsis","Stroke"],"otherNames":["Transcient Ischemic Attack"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To elucidate the hemodynamics of the cohort of four different groups of patients in the early hours of their presentation","timeFrame":"Emergency Department (ED) arrival to 2 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of clinical estimation of hemodynamics and values estimated by the NexfinHD on arrival and for up to 6 hours","timeFrame":"ED arrival to 6 hours"},{"measure":"To compare if abnormal hemodynamics as measured by the NexfinHD and clinical assessment after arrival to the ED in the 4 groups predicts life saving interventions within 2 hours","timeFrame":"ED arrival to 2 hours"},{"measure":"To calculate short term hemodynamic variability parameters and their prediction of life saving interventions within 2 hours and subjective/objective estimation of clinical improvement","timeFrame":"ED arrival to 2 hours"},{"measure":"Estimation of bias and precision of the non invasive hemodynamic trends in unselected patient group by assessing the validity of measurements with invasive measurements if used","timeFrame":"ED arrival to 2 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with acute CHF/COPD (n=12)\n* Patients with acute trauma and a trauma ISS\\>15 (n=12)\n* Patients with acute sepsis (n=12)\n* Patients with acute stroke (n=12)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients in cardiopulmonary arrest\n* patients with STEMI\n* Patients with known peripheral vascular disease\n* Pregnant patients\n* Age\\<18\n* Excessively agitated patients\n* Interference with current standard of acre","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acutely ill or injured Emergency Department patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Richard M Nowak, MD","affiliation":"Henry Ford Health System","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Henry Ford Hospital Emergency Department","city":"Detroit","state":"Michigan","zip":"48202","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.33143,"lon":-83.04575}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21802881","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Nowak RM, Sen A, Garcia AJ, Wilkie H, Yang JJ, Nowak MR, Moyer ML.
