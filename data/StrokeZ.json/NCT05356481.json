This study will be helpful in finding out that either low frequency segmental vibration on flexors muscle group is better in improving upper limb function or low frequency segmental vibration on extensor muscle group is more beneficent in improving upper limb function.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability and is often associated with persistent involvement of upper limbs.Several disturbances are the manifestation of UL impairments after stroke (i.e., muscle weakness, changes in muscle tone, joint disturbances, impaired motor control) . Muscular weakness and spasticity are most commonly observed in post stroke patients. There are many strategies are developed to improve functional status and to reduce spasticity pattern in post stroke patients. Among the different approaches to improve motor functions in post stroke patients, vibration therapy gives strong stimulatory effects in post paretic limb. Segmental muscle vibration (SMV) is a fairly new technique that has been used to improve motor function and inhibit spasticity in the hemiplegic upper extremity of patients following a stroke. In SMV, a vibratory stimulus is applied to a specific muscle tendon using a mechanical device unit.The aim of this study is to observe and to compare effects of segmental vibration on flexors versus extensor muscle groups on upper limb function in post-stroke patients. This study will be helpful in finding out that either low frequency segmental vibration on flexors muscle group is better in improving upper limb function or low frequency segmental vibration on extensor muscle group is more beneficent in improving upper limb function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["segmental muscle vibration,spasticity,upper limb function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"will recieve (low frequency segmental muscle vibration of 41 Hz over flexors muscles of upper limb Pectoralis minor, Biceps brachii, Flexor carpi muscle + general physical therapy session ) The transducer applied perpendicular to the muscle near its distal tendon insertion.The application consisted of 3 vibration sessions each with duration of 5 minutes for each muscle with 1 minute interval separated these sessions during the interval muscle vibration will interrupted and the subject will request to relax the muscle","interventionNames":["Device: segmental muscle vibration"]},{"label":"Experimental Group B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"group receive (low frequency segmental muscle vibration of 41 Hz over extensors muscles of upper limb Triceps brachii, Extensor carpi radialis longus \\& brevis + general physical therapy session ) The transducer applied perpendicular to the muscle near its distal tendon insertion The application consisted of 3 vibration sessions each with duration of 5 minutes for each muscle with 1 minute interval separated these sessions during the interval muscle vibration will interrupted and the subject will request to relax the muscle","interventionNames":["Device: segmental muscle vibration"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"segmental muscle vibration","description":"Segmental muscle vibration will delivered over the target muscles by means of vibrator with general physical therapy session","armGroupLabels":["Experimental Group A","Experimental Group B"],"otherNames":["general physical therapy session"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Functional Test","description":"WMFT is valid and reliable on assessing upper extremities motor function of stroke patients.
