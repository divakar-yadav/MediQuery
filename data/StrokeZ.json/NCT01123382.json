Surface electrical stimulation (ES) of muscles surrounding the hemiparetic shoulder has been demonstrated to be beneficial, but despite the evidence for therapeutic benefit, the clinical implementation of surface ES for poststroke shoulder pain has been difficult. In order to address the limitations of surface ES, the investigative team pioneered the development of percutaneous intramuscular (IM) ES for the treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain. However, prior to acceptance by the clinical community, additional gaps in the scientific and clinical knowledge need to be addressed. This study begins to do so. The primary objective is to estimate the relative pain reduction associated with IM ES vs. \"usual care.\" We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit a larger effect size with respect to pain reduction compared to \"usual care\". A secondary objective is to estimate the effect on health related QOL of IM ES vs. \"usual care.\" Demonstration of improvement in QOL will validate the clinical relevance of the intervention. We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit greater improvement in health related QOL compared to \"usual care\"."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["Stroke","Shoulder pain","Electrical stimulation","Neuromuscular stimulation","Intramuscular stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IM Electrical Stimulation (IM ES)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The IM ES Group will receive electrical stimulation treatment for three weeks (6 hrs daily) with an Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator following a one week electrode stabilization period.","interventionNames":["Device: Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator"]},{"label":"Usual Care (UC)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The Usual Care Group will receive outpatient therapy for four weeks, coupled with prescribed daily home exercises.","interventionNames":["Other: Outpatient Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator","description":"A sterile percutaneous IM electrode is implanted in the shoulder using a 20-gauge hypodermic needle and connected to an external cable.
