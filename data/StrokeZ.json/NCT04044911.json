Occupational therapy has been effective in improving ADL performance, however, inclusion of multiple tasks means it is unclear which therapy elements contribute to improvement.\n\nThis trial evaluates the efficacy of a task model approach to ADL rehabilitation, comparing training in making a cup of tea with a stepping training control condition.\n\nStroke survivors with AADS participate in a cross-over randomized controlled study. Participants attend five 1-hour tea making training sessions in which progress is monitored and feedback given using a computer-based system which implements a Markov Decision Process (MDP) task model (CogWatch). In a control condition participants receive five 1-hour stepping sessions.\n\nAnalysis compares tea making training with stepping training effects on error reduction and time taken in making 4 different tea types. A complex tea preparation task (making two different cups of tea simultaneously) is used to test for generalisation of training effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Apraxias"],"keywords":["Activity of daily living","Stroke","Apraxia","Action of daily living","Cup of tea"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Crossover randomized control","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tea making followed by stepping","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Five 1-hour weekly tea making training sessions in which progress is monitored and feedback given using a computer-based system that implements a Markov Decision Process (MDP) task model (CogWatch) is followed after a 3-week break by a control condition in which participants receive five 1-hour weekly stepping training sessions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Task model (CogWatch)"]},{"label":"Stepping followed by tea making","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A control condition comprising five 1-hour weekly stepping training sessions is followed after a 3-week break by five 1-hour weekly tea making training sessions in which progress is monitored and feedback given using a computer-based system that implements a Markov Decision Process (MDP) task model (COgWatch)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Task model (CogWatch)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Task model (CogWatch)","armGroupLabels":["Stepping followed by tea making","Tea making followed by stepping"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in tea making accuracy","description":"In three assessment sessions (initial, post-phase 1 training, post-phase 2 training), participants are seated at a table with objects and ingredients required for making a cup of tea placed in standard positions.
