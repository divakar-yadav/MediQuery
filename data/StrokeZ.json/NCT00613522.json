Several stroke risk factors were identified such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia or cardiac arrhythmias. Sleep respiratory disorders have been found to be frequent among patients with stroke. Among them obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome seems to be the most important due to its association with high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation.\n\nStroke can be responsible of central apneas, therefore the differential diagnosis between central apneas and pure OSA after stroke is sometimes difficult. The misidentification of OSA can explain the poor tolerance of CPAP treatment by these patients. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the association between pre-stroke OSA syndrome OSA diagnosed on specific scales and confirmed by polygraphic studies and stroke occurrence.","detailedDescription":"• Principal Objective : Investigate the association between obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed and hemispheric ischemic stroke\n\n• Secondary Objective :\n\nEvaluate the relation between obstructive sleep apnea and:\n\n* stroke mechanisms\n* stroke prognosis\n* post-stroke tolerance to CPAP treatment.\n\n  * Study design :\n\nProspective case-control study\n\n• Inclusion criteria :\n\nPatients (150):\n\nFist ischaemic hemispheric stroke or TIA Age: 50 to 90 French native speaker Able to answer the questions\n\nControls (600):\n\nAge: 50 to 90 French native speaker Able to answer the questions\n\n• Exclusion criteria : Patients Haemorrhagic stroke Stroke of the brainstem Past medical history of ischaemic stroke Dementia Confusion Unable to give his informed consent\n\nControls:\n\nPast medical history of ischaemic stroke Dementia Confusion Unable to give his informed consent\n\n• Study plan: Cases will be recruited in the stroke unit of the Pr Orgogozo at the Bordeaux University hospital.
