Previous studies on brachial vasomotor reactivity have shown a beneficial effect of remote ischemic preconditioning. It remains uncertain if a similar beneficial effect can be reproduced with cerebral vasomotor testing. Many biological mechanisms and effector pathways triggered by preconditioning have demonstrated endothelial protection and beneficial vascular effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"4x 5min Limb Preconditioning","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Either the right or left leg of the participant(s) will be made transiently ischemic for 5 minutes following by 5 minutes of rest.
