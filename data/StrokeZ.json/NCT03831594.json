Patients will be randomised to receive standard Physiotherapy treatment or standard treatment with GVS.\n\nPerceived verticality data will also be collected and analysed on age-matched controls. This data will be used to compare these results with the patients with PS.\n\nThe investigators hypothesis that GVS and standard Physiotherapy treatment will lead to a greater improvement in functional ability and awareness of perceived verticality compared to standard Physiotherapy alone.","detailedDescription":"Pusher syndrome (PS) can be described as disordered balance and orientation which causes patients to perceive they are in an upright position when in fact they are positioned towards their affected side. These patients use their unaffected limbs to 'push' themselves away from their unaffected side in an attempt to correct their perceived postural alignment. PS is a common disorder and can affect 16% of stroke patients.\n\nPatients with PS have shown to take longer to improve in rehabilitation than non-PS patients and tend to stay in hospital for longer.\n\nGalvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) involves passing a small electrical current behind the ear to stimulate the vestibular system to in-turn cause the head and body to move."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pusher Syndrome"],"keywords":["stroke","galvanic vestibular stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Physiotherapy and Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard physiotherapy concurrently with Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation for 45 minutes a day for two weeks (five days per week)","interventionNames":["Device: Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation","Other: Standard Physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Standard Physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard Physiotherapy for 45 minutes a day for two weeks (five days per week)","interventionNames":["Other: Standard Physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation","description":"Electrical current (under 1.5mA) applied to the mastoid processes to stimulate the balance organs in the inner ear","armGroupLabels":["Standard Physiotherapy and Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard Physiotherapy","description":"45 minutes of standard physiotherapy treating impairments and functional problems","armGroupLabels":["Standard Physiotherapy","Standard Physiotherapy and Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation"],"otherNames":["Standard Physical Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Scale of Contraversive Pushing","description":"This is made up of 3 components: 1.The symmetry of spontaneous body posture (rated with 0, 0.25, 0.75, or 1 point. 1 = severe tilt, 0 = no tilt), 2.
