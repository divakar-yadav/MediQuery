In France \\>4 million persons aged 60+ are estimated to have moderate to extensive covert cSVD (ccSVD), i.e. features of SVD on brain imaging without a history of clinical stroke. Better detection and management of covert cSVD would have a major impact on preventing disability and costs related to stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia. However, there are no specific mechanistic treatments for cSVD and hardly any recommendations worldwide on how to prevent and treat cSVD and related cognitive impairment. The aim of the present study, through the identification of novel cutting-edge multimodal biomarkers, is to develop innovative diagnostic and risk prediction tools for cSVD and its complications and to contribute to accelerating the discovery of novel drug targets and therapeutics strategies for cSVD.","detailedDescription":"cSVD is by far the most prevalent vascular contributor to cognitive impairment in the population. However, accurate quantitative estimates of the predictive ability of cSVD for dementia risk are lacking. Moreover, stratification of cognitive decline and dementia risk in cSVD patients according to imaging characteristics as well as evidence of coexisting neurodegenerative disease and vascular comorbidity are lacking. Hypertension is the strongest known risk factor for cSVD but there are currently no guidelines for the management of cSVD (or emerging guidelines based on weak evidence, and no specific mechanism-based treatments, leading to empirical and heterogeneous clinical practice, which in most instances consists of ignoring these lesions. This clinical blind spot represents a major \"missed opportunity\" for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia.\n\nThis study aims to explore the relation of brain and retinal microvasculature image characteristics (imaging biomarkers), as well as molecular biomarkers derived from blood, with presence or absence of extensive cSVD and with cognitive and other clinical characteristics in two groups of 200 patients 60+ years of age. The first group will consist of patients with little or no white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI (no or minor MRI features of cSVD); while the second will include patients with moderate to severe white matter hyperintensities (MRI features of extensive cSVD).\n\nThis will create a unique deeply characterized resource for epidemiological and mechanistic investigations of cSVD, which can also serve as a pilot setting to test the trajectories and requirements for individualized patient care of cSVD patients.\n\nThe combination of retinal microvascular measurements using innovative multimodal imaging is entirely novel to our knowledge. In the context of the RHU SHIVA program, the same retained imaging protocol will be implemented for 400 young adults, which will provide insight into trajectories of these retinal biomarkers across the adult lifespan).\n\nFor the molecular biomarkers allow the validation of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers for cSVD identified through secondary use of large existing cohort studies in the general population (3C, i-Share cohorts), in persons with memory complaints (MEMENTO cohort), and in collaboration with other cohorts with the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, also as part of the RHU SHIVA program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Stroke","Dementia"],"keywords":["Cognitive decline","Dementia","Stroke","Small vessel disease","Healthy brain aging","Brain imaging","Adaptive optics","Optical coherence tomography angiography","Prevention","Risk prediction","Genomic","Multiomics","Proteomics","Metabolomics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Minimal cSVD patient group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"little or no white matter hyperintensities","interventionNames":["Procedure: Retinal Imaging","Genetic: Blood sample","Procedure: Evaluation of cardiovascular risks","Procedure: Brain imaging (MRI)","Other: Cognitive Tests","Other: Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)","Other: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)","Diagnostic Test: Unipodal standing test","Other: Walking speed measurement"]},{"label":"Extensive cSVD patient group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"moderate to severe white matter hyperintensities","interventionNames":["Procedure: Retinal Imaging","Genetic: Blood sample","Procedure: Evaluation of cardiovascular risks","Procedure: Brain imaging (MRI)","Other: Cognitive Tests","Other: Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)","Other: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)","Diagnostic Test: Unipodal standing test","Other: Walking speed measurement"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Retinal Imaging","description":"Auto-Refractometry / Adaptative Optics (OA) / Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT-A) / Globe Axial length measurements / Color Retinophotography of the retina.","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Blood sample","description":"Analyses of molecular biomarkers including","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Evaluation of cardiovascular risks","description":"Measurement of blood pressure and arterial stiffness","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Brain imaging (MRI)","description":"3DT1 / 3DFLAIR / T2GRE / DTI 15 directions (and B0MAP)","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cognitive Tests","description":"Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) / Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) / 16 items Free and Cued Recall (RL/RI 16 items) / Trail Making Test A et B (TMT A et B) / Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) / Phonemic (letter P) and semantic (animals) verbal fluency tests / Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)","description":"15 items","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)","description":"Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Unipodal standing test","description":"Unipodal standing test","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Walking speed measurement","description":"over 5 meters","armGroupLabels":["Extensive cSVD patient group","Minimal cSVD patient group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of images and the molecular data","description":"This comparison should help identify relevant biomarkers to characterize and categorize cSVD.
