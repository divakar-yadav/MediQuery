This Phase 1 study will comprise 4 sub-parts: Part A, a single ascending dose (SAD) study; Part B, a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study; Part C, a desmopressin challenge study to explore (i) whether desmopressin could be used as an antidote, and/or (ii) whether desmopressin stimulated vonWillebrand Factor (VWF) release is overcome with increasing BT200 doses; and Part D, a relative bioavailability (BA) study.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability profile of BT200 in NHVs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular
