Dysphagia caused by stroke is the primary cause of dysphagia and an independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients. The rehabilitation of cognitive function is the key to the assessment of swallowing and the recovery of rehabilitation function after stroke, and complete consciousness, sensorimotor consciousness and motivation are the prerequisites for the rehabilitation of swallowing function. Traditional rehabilitation programs focus more on the single task training of patients' function and ignore the training of cognitive function. Cognitive deglutition dual task training is a kind of cognitive rehabilitation training at the same time of deglutition rehabilitation treatment. In this study, the \"dual task\" training mode of cognitive combined sucking training was applied to the rehabilitation of patients with swallowing dysfunction after stroke, to evaluate the rehabilitation of patients with swallowing function and cognitive function, and to further guide the clinical development and implementation of early rehabilitation treatment and nursing.\n\nExpected results:\n\nThrough this topic research, on the basis of traditional swallowing training to develop a set of scientific and advanced type of swallowing disorder in patients with stroke rehabilitation training of the new strategy, combined with cognitive training and sucking training for swallowing disorder in patients with cerebral apoplexy and to provide professional, systematic and comprehensive rehabilitation guidance, promote patients early recovery and return to society."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prospective Study"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group received routine nursing, including diet nursing, life nursing, direct and indirect training, health education and so on.
