A minimum of 640 to a maximum of 800 subjects will be registered from approximately 50 sites in the United States and Canada. Subject registration is capped at 75 per site. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be assessed at 1-month follow-up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (MI), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within 1 month (prior to 1-month visit but at least 28 days) after stenting AND have been compliant with 1-month DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for \\> 7 consecutive days are considered as \"1-month clear\", and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor inhibitor as early as 28 days and continued with aspirin monotherapy through 12-month follow-up.\n\nAll registered subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure. The data collected from the XIENCE 28 USA Study will be pooled with the data from the XIENCE 28 Global Study (Protocol # ABT-CIP-10235) to compare with the historical control of non-complex HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT duration of up to 12 months from the XIENCE V USA Study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bleeding Disorder","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Hematological Diseases","Thrombocytopenia","Coagulation Disorder","Anemia","Renal Insufficiency","Coronary Artery Disease"],"keywords":["High Bleeding Risk (HBR)","Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)","Drug eluting stent (DES)","XIENCE","Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)","Coronary Artery Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1605,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"XIENCE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"XIENCE + 1 month DAPT","interventionNames":["Device: XIENCE","Drug: DAPT (aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"XIENCE","description":"Subjects who received XIENCE family stent systems will be included.","armGroupLabels":["XIENCE"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"DAPT (aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor)","description":"\"1-month clear\" subjects (pooled from Xience 28 USA study and Xience 28 Global study) will receive 1 month of DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for \\> 7 consecutive days and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor inhibitor as early as 28 days and will continue with aspirin monotherapy through 12-month follow-up.","armGroupLabels":["XIENCE"],"otherNames":["Dual antiplatelet therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Composite Rate of All Death or All Myocardial Infarction (MI) (Modified Academic Research Consortium [ARC]), by Propensity Score Quintile","description":"All death: All deaths are considered cardiac unless an unequivocal non-cardiac cause can be established.

Subject with a current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.\n8. Subject intends to participate in an investigational drug or device trial within 12 months following the index procedure. Transferring to the XIENCE 90 study will not be an exclusion criterion.\n9. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test.\n10.

pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel;\n* Objective signs of ischemia at rest (ECG changes) or during exercise test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel;\n* Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test (e.g.,Doppler flow velocity reserve, fractional flow reserve);\n* A TVR with a diameter stenosis ≥70% in the absence of the above mentioned ischemic signs or symptoms.","populationDescription":"The number of participants analyzed includes subjects who were available at that time of
