To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of purified n-3 PUFA preparations in human subjects for short observation periods. The principle aim of the current study is to test the hypothesis that the long-term use of highly purified EPA(eicosapentaenoic acid: 1800mg/day), in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is effective in preventing cardiovascular events in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction, Unstable Angina Pectoris, Sudden Cardiac Death, Stroke, Peripheral Artery Disease"],"keywords":["Eicosapentaenoic acid","Coronary artery disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18000}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester(EPADEL Capsule 300 TM)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major coronary events (sudden cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris including hospitalization for ischemic episodes,events of angioplasty/ stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"All-cause mortality"},{"measure":"Stroke"},{"measure":"Peripheral artery disease; and"},{"measure":"Cancer"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Eligible participants had a total cholesterol level of â‰§250mg/dL(6.5m mol/L) at baseline.\n* Hyperlipidemic patients with serum total cholesterol of 250mg/dL or more.
