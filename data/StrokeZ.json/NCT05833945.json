Currently, the protocols require the imaging techniques at the hospitals to differ ischemic strokes with large vessel occlusion (LVO) from others. In this study, a duplex POC will be used in combination with an APP to identify LVO ischemic strokes in a 800 patients'cohort with pre-hospital and in-hospital blood samples.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability and the second most common cause of death worldwide, accounting for around 6.7 million deaths each year. The burden of stroke due to illness, disability and early death is set to double within the next 15 years due to an ageing population. Currently, imaging techniques are required to differentiate ischemic strokes with large vessel occlusion (LVO) from others. Since those neuroimages cannot be easily done at a pre-hospital level, our objective is to develop a simple point-of-care test (POC) to differentiate between both ischemic strokes during the acute phase, which will allow in the future an earlier thrombectomy treatment and an improvement of the patient outcomes significantly. For that, the investigators will recruit a 800 patients' cohort with pre-hospital and in-hospital blood samples by a multiplex POC for the biomarker measurement using an APP in combination with clinical data to identify LVO ischemic strokes. Finally, an interim analysis is planned when 400 patients are recruited."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic"],"keywords":["Large Vessels Occlusion (LVO)","Thrombectomy","Biomarkers","Point of care test (POCT)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":800,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pre-hospital and in-hospital patients","description":"Patients recruited at the ambulance (ARM A) and at the hospital (ARM B).","interventionNames":["Device: Large Vessel Occlusion Biomarkers Test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Large Vessel Occlusion Biomarkers Test","description":"Duplex Point of Care test to measure the concentration of biomarkers associated to Large Vessel Occlusion in blood samples used in combination with an APP.","armGroupLabels":["Pre-hospital and in-hospital patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of the diagnosis accuracy of the algorithm LVOCheck (Specificity and sensibility)","description":"* Biomarkers\n* Clinical data (gender, age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure)\n* Neurologic scales (NIHSS, RACE, GFAST, Cincinatti)","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Viability of the implement of the tool at a pre-hospital environment","description":"* Estimated time in patients direct potentially transferred to the thrombectomy centers.\n* Error rate in tool performance at a pre-hospital and hospital environment.\n* Percentage of right use of the tool (human failares) at a pre-hospital and hospital environment.","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* I.1: Patients \\> 18 years old.\n* I.2: Stroke code activated.\n* I.3: \\< 6 hours from symptoms onset.
