Previous study also revealed that 53.4% of people after stroke experienced cognitive impairment. Different cognitive domains might be affected following stroke, such as attention, memory, language, and orientation, and the problems with memory are often prominent. Yet, there is no effective treatment for the post-stroke cognitive impairment.\n\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied on thoracic region and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) are simple and non-invasive treatment to improve upper limb motor function and cognitive function. However, no existing studies have explored on the effects of TENS and tVNS on cognitive function in people with stroke. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TENS on improving upper limb function and cognitive function in people with chronic stroke. Also, this study will investigate the cortical response of people with stroke during TENS by using EEG power spectrum analysis.","detailedDescription":"This study aims to investigate the effects of three intervention protocols in people with stroke. The participants in Group A will receive TENS on C6 and T5 level of the spine with upper limb exercises. The participants in Group B will receive tVNS on the cymba conchae of left outer ear with upper limb exercises. The participants in Group C will receive placebo tVNS with upper limb exercises."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"spine TENS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will be received eighteen 45-minute sessions of intervention, 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: spine TENS"]},{"label":"tVNS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will be received eighteen 45-minute sessions of intervention, 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: tVNS"]},{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The participants will be received eighteen 45-minute sessions of intervention, 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"spine TENS","description":"The participants in Group A will receive TENS (Burst mode, 9 pulses per burst, pulse frequency = 160 Hz, burst frequency = 2 Hz) with upper limb exercises.
