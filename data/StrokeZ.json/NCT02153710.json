The name of this disorder is called \"aphasia.\" Individuals in this study will receive one of two treatments. The first is a phonological (sound level) treatment and the second is a semantic (word level) treatment. Individuals in both groups will receive 60 hours of therapy for free (2 hours/day, 5 days/week, 6 weeks).","detailedDescription":"Purpose: The ultimate goal of anomia treatment should be to achieve gains in exemplars trained in the therapy session as well as generalization to untrained exemplars and contexts. Phonomotor treatment (PMT) has shown such effects but has not yet been compared to a commonly used lexical/semantic based treatment (semantic feature analysis; SFA).\n\nMethods: In a between group randomized controlled trial, 58 persons with aphasia characterized by anomia and phonological dysfunction were randomized to receive 56-60 hours of intensively delivered treatment over 6 weeks with testing pre-, post- and three-months post treatment termination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Anomia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":58,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phonomotor therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Phonomotor Therapy"]},{"label":"Semantic Feature Analysis therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Current standard of care therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Semantic Feature Analysis therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Semantic Feature Analysis therapy","description":"Control therapy; current standard of care therapy","armGroupLabels":["Semantic Feature Analysis therapy"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Phonomotor Therapy","description":"Experimental therapy.","armGroupLabels":["Phonomotor therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Spoken Word Production (Confrontation Naming)","description":"Reporting a change in percent correct scores pre-treatment versus 3-months post treatment.
