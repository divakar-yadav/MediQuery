Planned ROM exercises were applied to the individuals in the intervention group 3 times a day for 2 weeks, and no application was made to the control group other than routine treatment. Data were collected by the researcher using the Questionnaire Form, Patient Information Form, Functional Independence Scale and Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Exercise"],"keywords":["Functional Independence","Stroke","ROM Exercises","Quality of Life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients in this group continued their routine medical treatment program without any treatment."},{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this group continued their routine medical treatment program without any treatment.

The movements were started with the upper extremity on the unaffected side and then moved to the affected upper extremity. After the exercise applied to the affected upper extremity was finished, the same exercise was applied to the intact lower extremity and the affected lower extremity.
