Therefore, impairments in trunk function can lead to limitations of activity and participation, as well as to increase the risk of falling resulting in further disability, hospitalization and mortality.\n\nThe dysfunction of the core, which would significantly affect the function of the trunk, would seem to be linked to a reduction in muscle strength, to a delayed/asymmetrical activation of the muscles, as well as to proprioceptive alterations.\n\nFollowing this line, trunk exercises could then improve trunk control, postural control, and functional recovery.\n\nLooking at the literature, it has been seen how several randomized controlled trials have focused on the efficacy of trunk training in stroke populations with positive and encouraging results regarding the outcomes achieved within the experimental groups. However, these studies, in addition to including patients with both ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, did not always equalize the amount of exercise provided with a control group, showing heterogeneity in the exercises administered, and did not consider whether the therapeutic efficacy observed at the end of the treatment is still maintained over the long term.\n\nThe hypothesis is that a specific exercise program, based on core stability, will induce clinically significant and long-term improvements from the point of view of trunk control, and secondly in postural control, disability and quality of life in subjects with hemorrhagic stroke outcomes, versus general physiotherapy, and that these improvements will be maintained at least one year after the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["Hemorrhagic Stroke, Trunk Impairment, Core Stability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":86,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"90-minute session divided into:\n\n* 45 minutes of \"core stability\" treatment\n* 45 minutes of general rehabilitation (active / active, assisted / passive mobilization, stretching, posture maintenance, postural and autonomy training, cycle ergometer, exercise bike and ambulatory training).","interventionNames":["Other: Interventional programme"]},{"label":"General Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"90 minutes of general rehabilitation (active / active assisted / passive mobilization, stretching, posture maintenance, postural and autonomy training, cycle ergometer, exercise bike and ambulatory training).","interventionNames":["Other: General exercise programme"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Interventional programme","description":"90-minute session divided into:\n\n* 45 minutes of \"core stability\" treatment\n* 45 minutes of general rehabilitation (active / active, assisted / passive mobilization, stretching, posture maintenance, postural and autonomy training, cycle ergometer, exercise bike and ambulatory training).","armGroupLabels":["Experimental Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"General exercise programme","description":"90 minutes of general rehabilitation (active / active assisted / passive mobilization, stretching, posture maintenance, postural and autonomy training, cycle ergometer, exercise bike and ambulatory training).","armGroupLabels":["General Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from Baseline Trunk Impairment Scale at 8 weeks and 12 months","description":"The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) is a 17-item scale that aims to assess the static, dynamic balance and coordination of the trunk.
