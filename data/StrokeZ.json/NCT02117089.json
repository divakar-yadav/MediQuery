The higher the score, the better is the related motor function.","timeFrame":"1) up to 7 weeks, 2) 3 months after participants finish the training"},{"measure":"Change in Modified Ashworth Scale after training","description":"The Modified Ashworth Scale measures the resistance of a joint during passive motion, which indicates the muscle spasticity related to the joint motion, particularly the flexors. The Modified Ashworth Scale has six levels, i.e., 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4. The higher value is related to a higher joint resistance, i.e., higher muscle spasticity.","timeFrame":"1) up to 7 weeks, 2) 3 months after participants finish the training"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nThe recruited subjects will\n\n* have unilateral ischemic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage at least 6 months after the onset of single stroke\n* have moderate level of motor impairment in the affected upper limb, assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (9\\<shoulder/elbow\\<27; 6\\<wrist/hand\\<18)\n* have enough cognition to be able to follow the training protocol as assessed by Mini-metal State Examination (MMSE\\>21)\n* have detectable EMG signals (3 times of the standard deviation above the baseline) from the upper limb muscles.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Xiaoling Hu, Ph.D.","affiliation":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hong Kong","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Xiaoling Hu, Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+852 34003205","email":"xiaoling.hu@polyu.edu.hk"},{"name":"Xiaoling Hu, Ph.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":22.39407,"lon":114.13737}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35193124","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Guo Z, Zhou S, Ji K, Zhuang Y, Song J, Nam C, Hu X, Zheng Y.
