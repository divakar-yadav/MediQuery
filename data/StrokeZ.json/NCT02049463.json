The results will be correlated and comparison to the finding in clinical, carotid Doppler and duplex, CTA, MR, and catheter angiography.\n\nStatistics:\n\nThe significance of difference between parameters was computed using t-tests or paired t-test etc. A p value \\<0.05 is defined as significant.","detailedDescription":"The investigators plan to recruit data from patients that come to their department for angiography study and intervention (n=300) with different disease entity such as atherosclerosis, tumor, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or fistula, and other vascular disorders. A period of about 20 seconds of the carotid phonoangiography was recorded.\n\nStandard for comparison: catheter angiography, CTA, MRI/MRA. The degree of stenosis, the wall thickness, SI and density change was clustered and compared. The clinical and laboratory data will be reviewed and the vascular risk factors will be calculated.\n\nSpectrum analysis: The sound spectrum will be analysis with the FFT, wavelet, entropy, complexity, and HHT algorithms.\n\nThe correlation between change of spectrums and also the correlated clinical, images, and laboratory change will be further analysis by statistic method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Atherosclerosis","Seeing Sounds as Colors","Stenosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["carotid artery","sound","stenosis","wall","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"progression of stenosis","description":"Follow-up the severity of the carotid stenosis and correlate its wall change","timeFrame":"three years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"wall change","description":"correlate the phonographic change with the follow up CTA wall change.","timeFrame":"three years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
