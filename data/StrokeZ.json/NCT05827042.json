The DEVT (Direct Endovascular Treatment versus Standard Bridging Therapy for Acute Stroke Patients with Large Vessel Occlusion in The Anterior Circulation) and DIRECT-MT (Direct Intraarterial Thrombectomy in Order to Revascularize Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary Hospitals Trial) trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy alone is not inferior to intravenous alteplase bridging with endovascular treatment in terms of achieving 90-day functional independence for stroke patients with large vessel occlusion. However, it is unclear whether endovascular thrombectomy alone is noninferior to intravenous thrombolysis bridging with endovascular thrombectomy for achieving functional independence at 90 days among patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. Therefore, additional studies are needed to explore the potential benefit of endovascular thrombectomy alone in these patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Occlusion","Acute Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke Due to Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["Thrombectomy","thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":338,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular thrombectomy alone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive endovascular thrombectomy without intravenous thrombolysis.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Intravenous thrombolysis plus endovascular thrombectomy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive intravenous alteplase (0.9mg/kg, maximum 90mg) or tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg) before endovascular thrombectomy.","interventionNames":["Drug: Intravenous thrombolysis","Procedure: Endovascular thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intravenous thrombolysis","description":"Patients will receive intravenous alteplase (0.9mg/kg, maximum 90mg) or tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg) before endovascular thrombectomy.","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous thrombolysis plus endovascular thrombectomy"],"otherNames":["Alteplase or Tenecteplase"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular thrombectomy","description":"Endovascular thrombectomy","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular thrombectomy alone","Intravenous thrombolysis plus endovascular thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0-2 at day 90 (±14 days)","description":"The modified Rankin Score is an ordinal hierarchical scale ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability.","timeFrame":"90 (± 14 days) after procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0-3 at day 90 (±14 days)","description":"The modified Rankin Score is an ordinal hierarchical scale ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability.","timeFrame":"90 (± 14 days) after procedure"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0-1 at day 90 (±14 days)","description":"The modified Rankin Score is an ordinal hierarchical scale ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability.","timeFrame":"90 (± 14 days) after procedure"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0-4 at day 90 (±14 days)","description":"The modified Rankin Score is an ordinal hierarchical scale ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability.","timeFrame":"90 (± 14 days) after procedure"},{"measure":"Ordinal Shift analysis of modified Rankin Score at day 90 (±14 days)","description":"The modified Rankin Score is an ordinal hierarchical scale ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability.","timeFrame":"90 (± 14 days) after procedure"},{"measure":"Score on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours","description":"The NIHSS is an ordinal hierarchical scale to evaluate the severity of stroke by assessing a patient's performance.
