However, implementation in clinical practice is hampered by a lack of validation in the broad spectrum of stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy, whether or not in combination with thrombolysis or conservative treatment. Furthermore, the CT-DRAGON score considers multiple items, which are not always readily available in every setting. This study aims to investigate whether either a simplified version of the CT-DRAGON score with only three clinical items or a machine learning technique could be as powerful and more feasible.","detailedDescription":"The investigators aim to validate the CT-DRAGON score in all ischaemic stroke localisations and for all treatment options, including a conservative treatment policy. The predictability will then be compared with on the one hand simplified prognostic models that include only a selective set of highly predictive parameters that have already been described in the literature, such as patient age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS). On the other hand, machine learning techniques, that incorporate a large set of variables and have recently shown some promising results, will also be applied to predict long-term outcome after ischaemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["CT-DRAGON score"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":700,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"All patients diagnosed with a stroke are collected in the database."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale at day 90","description":"The modified rankin scale will be assessed at 90 days at a consultation or by a telephonic interview which is standard of care in the hospital.

For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score.
