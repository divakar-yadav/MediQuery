Anomia (i.e., word- finding difficulty) is a primary frustration for people with aphasia. Picture-based naming treatments for anomia are widely used in aphasia rehabilitation, but current treatment approaches do not address the long-term retention of naming abilities and do not focus on using these naming abilities in daily life. The current research aims to evaluate novel anomia treatment approaches to improve long-term retention and generalization to everyday life.\n\nThis study is one of two that are part of a larger grant. This record is for sub-study 2, which will evaluate the benefits of adaptive trial spacing.","detailedDescription":"Study 2: Evaluate the benefits of adaptive trial scheduling.\n\nStudy design: Investigators will enroll 32 people with aphasia in a randomized within-subjects crossover design comparing an adaptive scheduling condition to two non-adaptive conditions. Conditions will be matched for total treatment hours in a synchronous/asynchronous telehealth format designed to approximate real-world clinical practice. Participants will receive 10 weeks of computer-based training per condition, with probes administered at baseline and at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months post-treatment. Condition order will be randomly assigned and counter-balanced across participants. In total, Study 2 will include two initial assessment sessions, 30 one-on-one treatment sessions, 96 independent practice sessions, and 24 baseline and follow-up probe sessions per participant over a 1-year period. All assessment, treatment, and probe sessions will take place via telehealth.\n\nTreatment description: For each condition, all treatment procedures will be matched except for the number of treated words and the trial spacing manipulation. The treatment phase will consist of two weeks of one-on-one treatment twice per week in which the treating clinician will ensure participants know how to use the treatment web app and complete each step of flashcard practice with complete independence, followed by 8 weeks of combined synchronous/asynchronous telepractice, in which the participant will work with the treating clinician once per week and practice an additional 4 days a week for 30 minutes a day between sessions. To carefully control dosage between treatment conditions, all independent practice sessions will be logged and proctored by a student research assistant. In-person treatment sessions will each last 45 minutes to approximate realistic treatment dosage in outpatient or home health practice settings. Treatment will consist of effortful retrieval practice: on each trial, participants will see a picture of the target and attempt to name it, then press \"show answer\" to see and hear the target in verbal and written form. They will then rate their naming accuracy by button press. If they are unable to name the word correctly, they will be trained to replay the answer and repeat it 3 times prior to moving on to the next trial, per Conroy et al."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Research assistants responsible for coding data will be masked to treatment condition.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adaptive spacing, then high-item non-adaptive spacing, then low-item non-adaptive spacing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive all three naming treatment conditions in a randomized order - this is one possible ordering of those conditions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: High-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: Low-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition"]},{"label":"Adaptive spacing, then low-item non-adaptive spacing, then high-item non-adaptive spacing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive all three naming treatment conditions in a randomized order - this is one possible ordering of those conditions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: High-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: Low-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition"]},{"label":"High-item non-adaptive spacing, then adaptive spacing, then low-item non-adaptive spacing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive all three naming treatment conditions in a randomized order - this is one possible ordering of those conditions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: High-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: Low-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition"]},{"label":"High-item non-adaptive spacing, then low-item non-adaptive spacing, then adaptive spacing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive all three naming treatment conditions in a randomized order - this is one possible ordering of those conditions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: High-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: Low-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition"]},{"label":"Low-item non-adaptive spacing, then high-item non-adaptive spacing, then adaptive spacing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive all three naming treatment conditions in a randomized order - this is one possible ordering of those conditions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: High-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: Low-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition"]},{"label":"Low-item non-adaptive spacing, then adaptive spacing, then high-item non-adaptive spacing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive all three naming treatment conditions in a randomized order - this is one possible ordering of those conditions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: High-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition","Behavioral: Low-Item Non-Adaptive Spacing Condition"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Adaptive Spacing Condition","description":"Each of the 200 target words for practice are presented on a schedule determined by an algorithm that relies on the pattern of correct vs. incorrect responses for each item.
