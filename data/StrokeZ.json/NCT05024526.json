The purpose of this study was to observe the changes of imaging and the improvement of NIHSS and mRS in different groups.","detailedDescription":"A total of 80 patients with acute ischemic stroke of middle cerebral artery were randomly divided into two groups, edaravone dexborneol treatment group and edaravone treatment group. The mismatch area between the low perfusion area of MRI 3D-ASL and the infarct area of DWI was defined as the ischemic penumbra, and the CBF perfusion pseudo color images with PLD of 1.5s and 2.5s were recorded. The above two CBF perfusion images were subtracted, and the residual area was quantitatively analyzed to reflect the establishment of collateral circulation. We aimed to observe whether there were differences in the improvement of ischemic penumbra and the establishment of collateral circulation between two groups after treatment. Besides, the improvment of NIHSS and mRS was also observed in different periods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["edaravone dexborneol","ischemic penumbra","NIHSS","mRS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"edaravone dexborneol group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: edaravone dexborneol or edaravone"]},{"label":"edaravone group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: edaravone dexborneol or edaravone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"edaravone dexborneol or edaravone","description":"Edaravone dexborneol or edaravone is going to be used in two different groups to compare the efficacy.","armGroupLabels":["edaravone dexborneol group","edaravone group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"image changes in different groups","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS changes in different groups","timeFrame":"7days，14 days, 90 days"},{"measure":"mRS changes in different groups","timeFrame":"7days，14 days, 90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
