With special sensory motor and visual motility, investigaters want to improve the clinical condition and quality of life of STROKE participants.\n\nThe investigaters randomly select participants who only perform the rehabilitation treatment have performed. The other group that will receive the study's control group will receive the traditional rehabilitation physiotherapy treatment.\n\nThe investigaters assess the condition and quality of life of the patients. (EQ5-D, Barthel index, MRS test) The ivestigaters examine the functional movement and equilibrium variables of patients. (6MWT, Berg balance test, postgraduation) After that, participants are undergoing a 4-week intensive rehabilitation treatment. All participants are in post stroke.\n\nPrimary Hypothesis will be changes in life-quality tests (EQ5-D, Barthel index, MRS test). Functional tests show progress 6MWT, Berg balance test and postural control testing with posturography. The results are compared and evaluated among the groups.\n\nThe expected hypothesis is that visual and acoustic stimulation produces a better physical state at higher intensity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["balance","movement","exergaming","posture","quality of life","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exergaming 1/day","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Post stroke group that received 4 weeks of intensive therapy.
