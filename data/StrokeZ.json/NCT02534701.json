All other patients will be included in a registry (referred to as ERASER), where clinical information will be collected. The overall study duration is expected to be 18 Months. The expected duration of each subject's enrolment is approximately 90 days. Subjects will be followed with assessments at 90 days post stroke.\n\nThe basic concept of ERASER+ is the use an infarct prediction algorithm that has been trained on a large dataset of historical imaging data of patients treated with IV tPA, apply it to the pre-treatment imaging and compare its predictions with the actual outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","clot retrieval system","recanalization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":53,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ERIC® and SOFIA™","description":"ERIC® device in combination with SOFIA™ Distal Access Catheter","interventionNames":["Device: ERIC® and SOFIA™"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ERIC® and SOFIA™","description":"a self-expanding clot retrieval system","armGroupLabels":["ERIC® and SOFIA™"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"VOST (volume of saved tissue) = VPIv- VMT","description":"volume of saved tissue (VOST) as difference of the brain volume with an infarct risk of \\>50%, based on a prediction- algorithm trained in a historical cohort treated with IV tPA (VPIv) and the actual infarct volume","timeFrame":"30 h"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS≤2","description":"neurological outcomes (mRS≤2)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"NIHSS score improvement ≥10 from baseline","description":"neurological outcomes (NIHSS score improvement ≥10 from baseline)","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke with NIH-SS score of 8-25\n* CTP/ MRP \\<4.5h after symptom onset completed\n* CTA/ MRA confirms M1-occlusion\n* Groin puncture estimated \\<6h after stroke onset\n* Intended usage of ERIC® as first device in combination with SOFIA™ Distal Access -Catheter (secondary bail-out with other devices allowed)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* MCA \\>1/3 abnormal in DWI or CBV (ASPECTS ≤ 7, \\>100 mL)\n* Pre stroke mRS ≥ 2\n* Necessity of ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) angioplasty\n* Age \\<18 years","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients over 18 year with acute ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jens Fiehler, MD,PhD","affiliation":"Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Augsburg","city":"Augsburg","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":48.37154,"lon":10.89851}},{"facility":"Klinikum Dortmund","city":"Dortmund","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":51.51494,"lon":7.466}},{"facility":"Universität Greifswald","city":"Greifswald","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":54.09311,"lon":13.38786}},{"facility":"Asklepios Klinik Altona","city":"Hamburg","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.57532,"lon":10.01534}},{"facility":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf","city":"Hamburg","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.57532,"lon":10.01534}},{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg","city":"Heidelberg","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":49.40768,"lon":8.69079}},{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein","city":"Lübeck","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":53.86893,"lon":10.68729}},{"facility":"Klinikum der Universität München","city":"München","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":48.13743,"lon":11.57549}},{"facility":"Kantonspital Aarau","city":"Aarau","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.39254,"lon":8.04422}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31009356","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Fiehler J, Thomalla G, Bernhardt M, Kniep H, Berlis A, Dorn F, Eckert B, Kemmling A, Langner S, Remonda L, Reith W, Rohde S, Mohlenbruch M, Bendszus M, Forkert ND, Gellissen S.
