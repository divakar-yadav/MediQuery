A large number of studies have confirmed that the thrombolytic therapy can effectively open blood vessels and improve the functional prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, all guidelines recommend intravenous thrombolysis as the first treatment of ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 hours of onset. However, about 1/3 patients receiving thrombolysis will have good prognosis, while a large number of patients will still be disabled and even dead. How to improve the neurological prognosis of thrombolytic patients has been a hot topic in the world.\n\nRecent studies have found that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA in the treatment of AIS might improve the clinical prognosis and not significantly increase bleeding. Some studies have reported that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA could improve the blood vessel opening rate, and prevent re-occlusion after opening.\n\nBased on the discussion, the present study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of argatroban plus rt-PA in the treatment of AIS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":808,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Argatroban combined with rt-PA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drug: Argatroban combined with rt-PA Argatroban as a 100 ug/kg bolus over 3 to 5 minutes was administered intravenously within 1 hour of the tPA bolus followed by a continuous Argatroban infusion of 1.0 ug/kg per minute for 48 hours adjusted to a target activated partial thromboplastin time of 1.75 X baseline (about 10%)","interventionNames":["Drug: rt-PA","Drug: Argatroban"]},{"label":"rt-PA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Drug: rt-PA Intravenous throbolysis with 0.9mg/kg rtPA.","interventionNames":["Drug: rt-PA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"rt-PA","description":"Intravenous throbolysis with 0.9mg/kg rtPA","armGroupLabels":["Argatroban combined with rt-PA","rt-PA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Argatroban","description":"100 ug/kg bolus over 3 to 5 minutes was administered intravenously, followed by a continuous Argatroban infusion of 1.0 ug/kg per minute for 48 hours adjusted to a target activated partial thromboplastin time of 1.75 X baseline (about 10%)","armGroupLabels":["Argatroban combined with rt-PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-1）","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-2）","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"proportion of more than 2 decrease in NIHSS score","description":"NIHSS, National Institute of Health stroke scale","timeFrame":"48 hours"},{"measure":"proportion of early neurological deterioration","description":"Early neurological deterioration, defined as more than 4 increase in National Institute of Health stroke scale score","timeFrame":"48 hours"},{"measure":"Vascular Events","description":"The occurence of stroke or other vascular events","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","timeFrame":"48 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18-80 years old;\n2.
