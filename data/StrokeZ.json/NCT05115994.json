The investigators will compare those who got an OSA diagnosis in the SESAR (Swedish sleep apnea registry) stratified by high/low PAP compliance with an intraoral device group, a non treated OSA group as well as a control group without OSA until 2021. Main outcome variables will be major cardiovascular events or death. Outcome data will be collected from the National Patient Registry and Cause of death registry.\n\nGroups will be matched by propensity score for known confounders. Secondary analysis will consider modifying effect of different antihypertensive drugs (the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, type of therapy; DDD comparison) and the actual degree of hypertension control (blood pressure levels) on CV risk. It is intended to stratify the analysis for BP levels in order to evaluate if lower BP targets further reduce CV risk in hypertensive OSA patients. These analyses will likely be reported in separate publications.\n\nHYPOTHESIS\n\n1. PAP treatment in hypertensive OSA patients reduces the long term risk of major cardiovascular events (MCE) and premature death. The risk reduction is modified by PAP compliance, hypertension control and OSA severity.\n2. In hypertensive OSA patients, the investigators previously identified betablockade as a drug class leading to better pressure control (1). The investigators hypothesize that any risk reduction by PAP treated OSA is influenced by the types of antihypertensive drugs used.\n3. Lower blood pressure targets (ie better BP control) may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in PAP treated OSA patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea","Hypertension","Death, Cardiac","Treatment Compliance","Heart Failure","Stroke"],"keywords":["Continous positive airway pressure","Antihypertensive treatment","Risc prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"14 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hypertensive OSA patients, high PAP compliance","description":"Hypertensive OSA patients using their PAP device for at least 4 hrs/night","interventionNames":["Device: Continous positive airway pressure"]},{"label":"Hypertensive OSA patients, low PAP compliance","description":"Hypertensive OSA patients using their PAP device for less than 4 hrs/night","interventionNames":["Device: Continous positive airway pressure"]},{"label":"Intra oral device treatment","description":"Hypertensive OSA patients treated with IOD","interventionNames":["Device: Continous positive airway pressure"]},{"label":"Untreated OSA hypertensive patients","description":"Hypertensive OSA patients not using PAP or IOD"},{"label":"Hypertensive patients without OSA","description":"Control population from QregPV without OSA"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Continous positive airway pressure","armGroupLabels":["Hypertensive OSA patients, high PAP compliance","Hypertensive OSA patients, low PAP compliance","Intra oral device treatment"],"otherNames":["Antihypertensive pharmacological treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major cardiovascular event (MCE) or death","description":"First incidence of new myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, stroke or death (cardiovascular and all)","timeFrame":"First incidence during study, ie within 156 months (13 yrs) maximum"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood pressure control","description":"According to ESC/EHC 2018 guidelines","timeFrame":"at study end (latest available BP measurements up to december 2021), ie within 156 months (13 yrs) maximum"},{"measure":"New incidence of atrial fibrillation","description":"New diagnosis from patient registry","timeFrame":"First incidence during study, ie within 156 months (13yrs) maximum"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Subanalysis of MCE/death incidence, stratified by blood pressure levels","description":"Does baseline and end of study BP levels influence our outcomes?
