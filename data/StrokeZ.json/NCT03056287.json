Both AET and rTMS are established stand-alone treatments for non-stroke related depression, though neither has been adequately studied post-stroke. Furthermore, substantive research indicates that AET improves post-stroke locomotor function, thus offering a novel approach for treating PSD as well as an established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to rehabilitation.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to determine the impact of AET, rTMS and their combination (AET+rTMS) treatments on post-stroke depressive symptoms and locomotor function so as to guide the development of a future clinical trial. A total of 40 depressed post-stroke subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups 1) AET; 2) rTMS; 3) combined AET and rTMS (AET+rTMS) or 4) control (sham rTMS) group (n=10 per condition; equally distributed with mild and moderate MDD). Further, an additional 10 non-depressed post-stroke subjects will complete 8 weeks of AET so as to allow us to determine the effects of PSD on response to training (Aim 2). Training (AET, rTMS and AET+rTMS) will take place over an 8-week period, three times per week on non-consecutive days. Measures of depression (HRSD17) as well as self-selected walking speed (SSWS) will be performed prior to the initial treatment session of each week as well as 8 weeks following cessation of treatment. Additional measures of locomotor function (walking endurance and amount of daily community stepping) will be assessed prior to training (pre), following 4 weeks of training (mid), upon completion of 8 weeks of training (post) as well as 8 weeks following cessation of training (follow-up), allowing determination of the efficacy (and persistence) of training on these outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aerobic Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treadmill aerobic exercise","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic exercise"]},{"label":"rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","interventionNames":["Other: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"AET+rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combined aerobic exercise and rTMS","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic exercise","Other: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham rTMS","interventionNames":["Other: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Aerobic exercise","description":"treadmill aerobic exercise; 3 sessions per week, 40 minutes per session","armGroupLabels":["AET+rTMS","Aerobic Exercise"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"Repeated non-invasive brain stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.","armGroupLabels":["AET+rTMS","Sham","rTMS"],"otherNames":["rTMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression","description":"Rating of depressive symptom severity","timeFrame":"weekly throughout the 8 week intervention as well as at the 8 week follow-up visit"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in Self-selected walking speed","timeFrame":"weekly throughout the 8 week intervention as well as at the 8 week follow-up visit"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1) age 50-70\n* 2) stroke within the past 6 to 60 months,\n* 3) major depressive disorder (PHQ-9 \\> 10) and diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SCID) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV),\n* 4) residual paresis in the lower extremity (Fugl-Meyer LE motor score \\<34),\n* 5) ability to walk without assistance and without an AFO on the treadmill ≥ 30 seconds at speeds ranging from 0.2-0.8 m/s,\n* 6) no antidepressant medications or clinically able to discontinue medications,\n* 7) HRSD question #9 regarding suicide \\<2,\n* 8) provision of informed consent.
