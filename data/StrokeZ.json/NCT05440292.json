Limitation of upper limb function occurs in 55 -75% of patients after stroke. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have been shown that can promote functional recovery in stroke patients, and multiple studies have reported that low-frequency rTMS stimulation on the motor areas of the unaffected hemispheres of stroke patients can significantly improve motor function of the affected upper limb. The standard procedure for TMS to determine the primary motor area is to measure hotspot, which is used as a common target for movement disorders such as hemiplegia after stroke. In the 1990s, the hands-on task activation point determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) and positron emission computed tomography(PET) studies was located at \"Hand Knob\" in the primary motor area. The study found that although the hands-on task activation point was closer to hotspot, it was significantly different from hotspot. The hands-on task activation point had stronger functional connection with the whole brain, especially the motor cognition-related brain area. Therefore, this study aims to compare the efficacy of rTMS stimulation on individual rTMS targets(task fMRI activation point) with traditional hotspot in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. The regulation effect of rTMS was evaluated by using local brain function indicators and functional connections, and the longitudinal change pattern of brain function before and after treatment was observed to explore the therapeutic targets of rTMS for motor dysfunction after stroke and the mechanism of brain functional plasticity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Upper Extremity Dysfunction","Brain Plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hotspot-rTMS Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"rTMS stimulate on the hotspot of unaffected hemisphere","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"fMRI-rTMS Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"rTMS stimulate on the motor task activation poin (targeted by fMRI) of unaffected hemisphere","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"For each stimulation day, low-frequency (1 Hz) ,1800 pulses(intensity of 100% resting motor threshold(RMT), duration 30 min) rTMS stimulation were delivered on the hotspot of unaffected hemisphere(Hotspot-rTMS Group) and the motor task activation poin of unaffected hemisphere(fMRI-rTMS Group). rTMS which guided by individualized navigation delivery 5 days a week for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Hotspot-rTMS Group","fMRI-rTMS Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity","description":"Only scoring for the upper limb motor function, including 33 items, scores range from 0 to 66 points.
