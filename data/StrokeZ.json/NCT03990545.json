This disparity in outcomes may be related to biologic sex-differences that manifest in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Decades of cyclic changes in the hormonal milieu lead to different metabolic profiles in women. These changes may also explain sex-differences in risk factor profiles of atherogenesis and plaque composition. The investigators' objective is to conduct a cross-sectional MR imaging study of suspected stroke patients to compare the burden and composition of intracranial atherosclerosis and risk factors between men and women. Results from this study are expected to show that sex and sex-specific risk factors should be considered at the outset of stroke evaluation for risk-stratification. In the era of precision medicine, the investigators propose the role of sex should be a starting point in the clinical evaluation of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Atherosclerosis","Acute Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["intracranial atherosclerotic disease","acute stroke","transient ischemic attack","vessel wall imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cases with stroke"},{"label":"Controls without stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of intracranial arterial wall abnormalities by sex.","description":"Vessel wall imaging characteristics on multicontrast MR imaging","timeFrame":"1 day (Evaluated at time of clinical presentation)."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Older than 18 years\n* Suspected stroke patients\n* No contraindications for an MRI exam or gadolinium intravenous contrast\n* No need for an emergent interventional treatment (e.g., thrombectomy)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Younger than 18 years\n* Pregnant","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Suspected stroke patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jae W Song, MD","affiliation":"University of Pennsylvania","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania","city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"19104","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.95233,"lon":-75.16379}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"},{"id":"D000002537","term":"Intracranial Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000050197","term":"Atherosclerosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000020765","term":"Intracranial Arterial Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M25878","name":"Atherosclerosis","asFound":"Atherosclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5476","name":"Intracranial Arteriosclerosis","asFound":"Intracranial Atherosclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22211","name":"Intracranial Arterial Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
