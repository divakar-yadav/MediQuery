The reasons for this situation are economic, but also related to the non consideration of the context of utilization . It is therefore important to involve the users of the innovation in the development process because it is the latter that will broadcast. Psychosocial perspective of the acceptability of the technology meets this need by including the users' perceptions toward device (s).\n\nThe ROBO-K project aimed at developping a mobile and interactive robot, dedicated to the rehabilitation of balance and gait at an early stage. It was intended for patients with impaired walking vascular neurological, traumatic or associated with chronic neurological disease. The first step for its developement was conducted with the psychosocial approach of Technology acceptability which has required specific methods for collecting the views of users and analysis of the activity.
