Traditional rehabilitation methods fall short of achieving desirable walking outcomes for most people who experience stroke. Robotic methods to assist walking, such as the Honda Walking Assist Device (HWA) Robot from Honda R \\& D Americas Inc., are being explored as a means of improving the recovery of walking post stroke. Prior to examining the effectiveness of exoskeletal robots for walking recovery it is important to understand their effect on kinematic and muscle responses during walking. Kinematic and muscle responses at the hip during walking with the HWA were recently described.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of walking with the HWA on body segments remote from the hip. These segments include knee, ankle, trunk and arm. The non-invasive measures used will include: walking kinematics (measurement of joint angles using cameras), muscle activity (Electromyography), ground reaction forces (detected by a force plate in the floor) and spatiotemporal characteristics (such as walking speed). Measures will be collected under three conditions: 1) walking at self-selected pace (control), 2) walking at self-selected pace with the HWA (4 Newton-meter assist mode for hip flexion and extension), 3) walking immediately following HWA use (aftereffect)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["exoskeleton","gait","kinematics","EMG","stair climbing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Within-subject design","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic exoskeleton for walking assist","description":"Participants will have two testing sessions in this within-subject design experiment.
