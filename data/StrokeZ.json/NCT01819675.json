Changes in some neurotransmitters' status in brain after rTMS have been suggested as a possible mechanism, but role of GABA is not clear.\n\nTwelve healthy people will be recruited. They will receive the rTMS over the primary motor cortex of the dominant hand. Individual subject will receive three sessions of rTMS with wash-out period (more than 3 days) between the rTMS sessions. Three rTMS sessions are high frequency (10Hz), low frequency (1Hz) and sham rTMS. The order of rTMS sessions will be randomly decided. After completing each rTMS session, \\[18F\\]flumazenil-PET will be checked.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate 1)whether rTMS over the primary motor cortex can modulate the \\[18F\\]flumazenil binding potential and 2)whether the modulation of \\[18F\\]flumazenil binding potential by rTMS can be different according to the applied frequency of rTMS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Neuronal plasticity","Neurotransmitter agents","Receptors, neurotransmitter","Transcranial magnetic stimulation","Stroke","gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High frequency (10Hz) rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"\\<high frequency rTMS parameters\\> Intensity: 120% of resting motor threshold; Location: Motor hotspot in primary motor cortex for the dominant hand; Frequency: 10Hz; Number of total stimuli: 750; Coil orientation: tangential to scalp","interventionNames":["Device: High frequency rTMS"]},{"label":"Low frequency (1Hz) rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"\\<low frequency rTMS parameters\\> Intensity: 120% of resting motor threshold; Location: Motor hotspot in primary motor cortex for the dominant hand; Frequency: 1Hz; Number of total stimuli: 1200; Coil orientation: tangential to the scalp","interventionNames":["Device: Low frequency rTMS"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"\\<Sham rTMS parameters\\> Intensity: 120% of resting motor threshold; Location: Motor hotspot in primary motor cortex for the dominant hand; Frequency: 1Hz; Number of total stimuli: 1200; Coil orientation: perpendicular to scalp","interventionNames":["Device: Sham rTMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low frequency rTMS","armGroupLabels":["Low frequency (1Hz) rTMS"],"otherNames":["Magpro (low frequency)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High frequency rTMS","armGroupLabels":["High frequency (10Hz) rTMS"],"otherNames":["Magpro (high frequency)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham rTMS","armGroupLabels":["Sham rTMS"],"otherNames":["Magpro (sham)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"[18F]flumazenil binding potential","description":"Immediately after rTMS session , PET image will be acquired.
