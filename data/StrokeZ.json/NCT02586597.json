This work will develop an innovative brain stimulation method (paired associative stimulation) which might set the stage for a new treatment for stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United States after heart disease and cancer. An innovative recovery treatment is in demand for stroke motor recovery. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a new technique where one pairs a peripheral stimulation with centrally applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and produces plasticity, as measured by TMS motor-evoked potentials (MEP's). The investigators will also compare post-stroke patients to healthy controls on the modulation effect of PAS and motor behavior measures.\n\nAim1. To investigate whether PAS (PAS25 or PAS10) can modulate motor excitability and plasticity;\n\nAim2. To investigate whether PAS can modify motor behaviors measures in both post-stroke patients and healthy controls;\n\nAim3. To investigate whether post-stroke patients show different modulation of PAS on both cortical plasticity and motor behavior measure compared to healthy controls.\n\nFor this study the investigators will enroll a total of 10 chronic stroke patients and 10 neurologically healthy controls matched for age and gender. Participants will have 4 visits. The first visit is for screening. They will receive either sham PAS or real PAS25 or real PAS10 at each following treatment visit.\n\nExperimental Methods: Clinical Behavioral Measures: Handgrip; Nine-hole Peg Test; Wolf Motor Function Test; Imaging protocol: T1 weighted anatomical image, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Stimulation locations: Left primary motor (M1); right median nerve; PAS methods: TMS stimulation will be delivered at 25 ms or 10 ms or 100 ms after median nerve stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","PAS","TMS","cortical excitability","plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PAS 10: TMS and median nerve stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a new technique where one pairs a peripheral stimulation with centrally applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and produces plasticity, as measured by TMS MEP's.
