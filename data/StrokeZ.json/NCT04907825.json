Participants will be randomized (by pharmacy) to either to an intervention arm of pharmacist-led OAC management versus an enhanced usual care arm, wherein physicians receive notification of 'actionable' AF and patients are advised to schedule a physician clinic visit. The primary objective will be to determine the difference in proportion of patients with 'actionable AF' receiving guideline concordant OAC therapy at 3 months in those randomized to intervention arm versus control arm.","detailedDescription":"Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in AF is safe and effective but under-utilized. Optimal delivery of existing therapies would prevent AF-related stroke. Therefore alternative strategies to increase adherence to current guidelines for OAC use for AF stroke prevention should be explored.\n\nAccumulating data indicate that pharmacist-led or pharmacist-collaborative care in cardiovascular disease monitoring, risk factor control, and medication optimization leads to greater adherence to guideline-directed targets and improved outcomes.\n\nIn this prospective, open-label, cluster-randomized controlled trial the investigators intend to enroll 400 participants (aged 60 years or older, with additional stroke risk factors and 'actionable' undertreated AF) from a total of 40 retail and outpatient community pharmacies in Los Angeles. Participants will be randomized (by pharmacy) to either to an intervention arm of pharmacist-led OAC management versus an enhanced usual care arm, wherein physicians receive notification of 'actionable' AF and patients are advised to schedule a physician clinic visit. The primary objective will be to determine the difference in proportion of patients with 'actionable AF' receiving guideline concordant OAC therapy at 3 months in those randomized to intervention arm versus control arm. Secondary outcomes include: patient satisfaction with pharmacist services (at 3 months), pharmacists' perspective on study implementation (at study end), and OAC adherence (at 1 year). In an exploratory aim, the investigators will assess healthcare utilization and clinical outcomes at 1 year.\n\nThis research will generate new knowledge on an innovative, and potentially sustainable stroke prevention strategy to increase evidence-based use of OAC therapy in patients with AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Oral Anticoagulants","Pharmacist Case Management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, open-label, cluster-randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pharmacist Intervention Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pharmacist to prescribe/monitor/manage oral anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis (under collaborative practice agreement with participants primary care provider) in accordance with ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines.","interventionNames":["Drug: Oral anticoagulant"]},{"label":"Enhanced Usual Care Control Arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pharmacist to notify primary care provider that patient has 'actionable' atrial fibrillation and provide current medication list.","interventionNames":["Drug: Oral anticoagulant"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Oral anticoagulant","description":"Anticoagulant therapy will be initiated/titrated in patients with atrial fibrillation in accordance with ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines","armGroupLabels":["Enhanced Usual Care Control Arm","Pharmacist Intervention Arm"],"otherNames":["warfarin","novel oral anticoagulants"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Optimal OAC Therapy","description":"To determine the difference in proportion of patients with 'actionable AF' receiving optimal OAC therapy at 3 months in those randomized to intervention arm versus control arm.","timeFrame":"At 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"'Actionable' AF Prevalence","description":"To determine the prevalence of patients with 'actionable AF'","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 1 year"},{"measure":"Medication Adherence (NOAC)","description":"To assess OAC adherence (i.e. proportion of days covered (PDC) for NOACS)","timeFrame":"At 12 months"},{"measure":"Medication Adherence (Warfarin)","description":"To assess OAC adherence (i.e. time in the therapeutic range (TTR) for warfarin)","timeFrame":"At 12 months"},{"measure":"Patient Satisfaction with Pharmacist Services","description":"To assess patient satisfaction with pharmacist services using 22-item questionnaire","timeFrame":"At 3 months"},{"measure":"Qualitative Review of Program Implementation","description":"To perform a qualitative review of program implementation by surveying pharmacists about their experiences with 11-item questionnaire","timeFrame":"Through study completion, an average of 1 year"},{"measure":"Healthcare Utilization","description":"To assess healthcare utilization (i.e. the number of physician visits, specialist visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations)","timeFrame":"At 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
