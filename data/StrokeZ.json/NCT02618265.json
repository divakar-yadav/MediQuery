Improving secondary prevention will strongly promote stroke management in the rapid developing phase of Chinese economy and expansion of health situation. At present lack of high-quality medical resources, low medical permeability cannot remedy extensive prevention failure of stroke. Mobile healthcare is easier to conduct and still in the early stage of explosive growth. This research group has established an open management platform of stroke prevention. And collaborate with Peking University Institute of Information Technology to develop a smart phone application which can be personalized medication reminder, record medication compliance, home blood pressure and blood glucose test results, also can provide doctor-patient communication platform and symptoms alarm. The investigators want to verify whether mobile application based on stroke strengthen prevention management is more effective than traditional management model or open stroke management platform. Whole blood-impedance based platelet aggregation(WBA) method and VerifyNow detected by aspirin or clopidogrel responsiveness will provide individualized anti-platelet drug selection. Control group will be selected from the National Stroke data registration database platform and open platform for stroke prevention. Follow-up period is 2 years. Endpoint event is defined as stroke death or relapse. Primary measure outcomes are change of the stroke recurrence rate and mortality after secondary prevention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","secondary prevention","platelet response polymorphism","mobile terminal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mobile terminal","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke received mobile terminal management for secondary prevention administration, as the same time platelet reactivity modified drug selection was performed.
