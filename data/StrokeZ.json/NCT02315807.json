This study is a double blind, sham-controlled clinical trial aiming to compare the long-term effects of stimulation in two different cognitive regions after a stroke. Sixty patients who suffer from chronic strokes will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulo-opercular network and motor primary cortex (control). Each group will receive transcranial direct current stimulation for 20 minutes for 10 consecutive working days (2 weeks). Patients will be assessed with a Dysexecutive Questionnaire, Semantic Fluency test, categorical verbal fluency and Go-no go tests, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, Letter Comparison and Pattern Comparison Tasks at baseline, after their tenth stimulation session (week 2) and endpoint (week 4). Those who achieve clinical improvement with neurostimulation will be invited to receive treatment for 12 months as part of a follow-up study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"dlPFC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the chronic post-stroke stage will receive active transcranial direct current stimulation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation"]},{"label":"CON","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the chronic post-stroke stage will receive active transcranial direct current stimulation in cingulo-opercular network","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation"]},{"label":"M1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in the chronic post-stroke stage will receive active transcranial direct current stimulation in motor primary cortex","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial direct current stimulation","armGroupLabels":["CON","M1","dlPFC"],"otherNames":["tdcs"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Executive Function measured by Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX)","timeFrame":"Change for executive functions at 4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Verbal Fluency (Semantic Fluency Test)","timeFrame":"[ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 ]"},{"measure":"Response inhibition (Go-no-go Test)","timeFrame":"[ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 ]"},{"measure":"Executive function (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults)","timeFrame":"[ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 ]"},{"measure":"Memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning)","timeFrame":"[ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 ]"},{"measure":"Processing Speed (Letter Comparison and Pattern Comparison Tasks)","timeFrame":"[ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 ]"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischaemic chronic stroke\n* Mild/Moderate Cognitive impairment\n* Informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥ 16 points\n* Severe cognitive comorbidities (dementia, depression)\n* transcranial direct current stimulation criteria: use of modulators of the Central Nervous System drugs; patients with implanted metallic or electronic devices; pacemaker; seizures; pregnancy;any other condition that might limit or interfere in the sensorimotor system","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Suellen Andrade","role":"CONTACT","email":"suellenandrade@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Suellen Andrade, PhD","affiliation":"Federal University of Paraíba","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Suellen Andrade","status":"RECRUITING","city":"João Pessoa","state":"PB","country":"Brazil","contacts":[{"name":"Suellen Andrade","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-7.115,"lon":-34.86306}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"26420269","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Andrade SM, Fernandez-Calvo B, Boggio PS, de Oliveira EA, Gomes LF, Pinheiro Junior JE, Rodrigues RM, de Almeida NL, Moreira GM, Alves NT.
