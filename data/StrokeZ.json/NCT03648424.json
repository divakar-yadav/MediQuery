Given that medications of both classes are currently advocated as second-line therapy after metformin, and since sulfonylureas have been associated with concerns regarding their CV safety, while dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have been suggested to exhibit CV benefits in preclinical and mechanistic trials, the results of this trial will provide answers to several clinically relevant questions and have a significant impact on clinical practice.\n\nThis cohort study was initiated to predict the findings of CAROLINA trial in a real world setting using electronic claims data from insurance databases with results anticipated prior to the completion of CAROLINA. Trial eligibility criteria were adapted in claims data to generate a comparable study cohort (of linagliptin and glimepiride initiators) to that of the trial population. Using 1:1 propensity score-matching was used to control for \\>120 baseline characteristics. Patients were followed up for a composite cardiovascular outcome adapted from the primary end-point of the CAROLINA trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Linagliptin","Cardiovascular Death","Stroke","Myocardial Infarction","Hospitalization for Unstable Angina","Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Glimepiride"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48262,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Linagliptin","description":"Patients who initiate Linagliptin with no use in the prior 180 days"},{"label":"Glimepiride","description":"Patients who initiate Glimepiride with no use in the prior 180 days"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite Cardiovascular (CV) Outcome","description":"Composite CV Outcome includes Myocardial infarction, Stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina and Death","timeFrame":"From treatment initiation to end of follow-up, up to 53 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with Type 2 diabetes who were new users of Linagliptin or new users of Glimepiride and:\n\n  - Had no more than 3 anti-diabetic drugs including index drug\n* AND at elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) events according to specific criteria:\n\n  * Previous vascular disease\n  * Evidence of vascular-related end-organ damage\n  * Age ⩾ 70 years\n  * ⩾ 2 CV risk factors:\n\n    * Treated hypertension\n    * Smoking\n    * Using any lipid lowering treatment\n* Age ≥ 40 and ≤ 85 years at treatment initiation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus\n* Previous exposure to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), insulin or sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2s).\n* Exclude anti-diabetic background therapy if initiated in 2 months prior\n* Morbid obesity or treatment with anti-obesity drugs 3 months prior to treatment initiation\n* Severe hyperglycemia\n* Active liver disease or impaired hepatic function\n* Any previous bariatric surgery\n* Coronary artery re-vascularisation ≤ 6 weeks prior to treatment initiation\n* Prior hospitalization for congestive heart failure\n* Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis\n* Hereditary galactose intolerance\n* Alcohol or drug abuse within the 3 months prior to treatment initiation\n* Use of oral corticosteroids\n* Pregnant women\n* Patients with cancer\n* Acute coronary syndrome ≤ 6 weeks prior to treatment initiation\n* Stroke or Transient ischemic attack ≤ 3 months prior to treatment initiation","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients 40 - 85 years of age with early Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, increased cardiovascular risk or established complications","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Elisabetta Patorno, MD DrPH","affiliation":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02120","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31239281","type":"RESULT","citation":"Patorno E, Schneeweiss S, Gopalakrishnan C, Martin D, Franklin JM.
