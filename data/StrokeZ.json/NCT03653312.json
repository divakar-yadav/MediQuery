In 2008, 30.7 million people had survived a stroke. Every year, there are about 14,000 new cases of stroke in Denmark and the number is expected to rise with about 40% by 2035, due to the increasing population of elderly. Stroke survivors have the worst odds of reporting severe disability and the greatest variety of individual domains of disability compared to a range of other diseases. Therefore, these patients have essential rehabilitation needs. Little is known about who will benefit from functional interventional rehabilitation and what kind of intervention is best.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to examine the added effect of NeuroMuscular Electric Stimulation (NMES) in addition to exercise therapy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke.\n\nThis RCT includes 50 patients allocated to either control or intervention. The inclusion, test, training and re-test will be provided during the first 14 days after ictus, starting day 1 after ictus and a follow-up at day 90.\n\nThe exercise training with external NMES is done with the patient every weekday for 12 minutes.\n\nIf NMES increases functionality in acute stroke patients it would mean a greater degree of independence for individual patients and thus have the potential to improve on a major problem for society.\n\nBy combining comorbidity, stroke severity, and other demographic data it might be possible to get a greater knowledge about who will benefit from the intervention and early rehabilitation and that will be the a step towards \"personalized medicine\" in stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation","Exercise"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Neuromuscular electrical stimulation","Activities of daily living","Patient reported outcome","Fugl Meyer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel group, assessor blinded, randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"One blinded outcome assessor (physiotherapists) will perform measurements of functional capacity, patient reported outcome, and cognition.
