Thus, depending on the results obtained, circulating BDNF could serve as an early marker of these."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["BDNF"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with fibrinolysis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood samples","Other: Cerebral MRI"]},{"label":"Patients without fibrinolysis","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Biological: Blood samples","Other: Cerebral MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Blood samples","armGroupLabels":["Patients with fibrinolysis","Patients without fibrinolysis"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cerebral MRI","armGroupLabels":["Patients with fibrinolysis","Patients without fibrinolysis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement of plasma levels of BDNF","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at Day1, Day 7 and Month 3"},{"measure":"Measurement of serum levels of BDNF","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at Day1, Day 7 and Month 3"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients (or their person of trust in cases of inability) who have been informed about the research and given their consent to take part\n* Patients aged 18 years or older\n* Patients who have suffered a de novo recent ischemic stroke \\< 12 hours\n* Patients who had cerebral imaging (CT-Scan or MRI)\n* Ischemic stroke severity, measured by the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS), between 4 and 20\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients without national health insurance cover\n\n* Patients with a clinical history of stroke\n* Patients with cerebral or sub-arachnoid haemorrhage\n* Patients with a transient ischemic attack\n* Time of symptom onset unknown\n* Patients with severe aphasia at the time of the ischemic stroke defined by a sub-score for item 9 (best language) of the NIHSS ≥ 2\n* Patients with dementia prior to the ischemic stroke\n* Patients with a significant loss of autonomy prior to the ischemic stroke, defined by a Rankin score ≥ 4\n* Patients with aphasia before the ischemic stroke\n* Patients with a contra-indication for cerebral MRI\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women\n* Adults under guardianship\n* Subjects in custody\n* Patients who do not speak French","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire","city":"Dijon","zip":"21079","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13539","name":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
