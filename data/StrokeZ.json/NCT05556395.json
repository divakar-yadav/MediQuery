Specifically this study is testing whether global disruption of the blood-brain barrier detected at the time of the stroke is informative about the risk of post-stroke cognitive decline over the next 3 years.","detailedDescription":"It is well known that ischemic stroke is a risk factor for developing dementia. Prior studies have shown that after a stroke, there can be a change in the trajectory of cognitive performance with acceleration of decline. The mechanism of this phenomenon has not been established. It is known that vascular changes in the brain, referred to as cerebral small vessel disease, are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Cerebral small vessel disease is readily seen on MRI scans of the brain, and the larger the burden of these findings, the higher the risk of cognitive deficits. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier has been implicated in the development of the changes seen on MRI. Acute stroke has been shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, even in parts of the brain not directly affect by the stroke. The investigators hypothesize that when there is diffuse blood-brain barrier disruption in response to an acute stroke it sets off a cascade of changes in the brain that lead to post-stroke cognitive decline."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["blood-brain barrier","post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia","vascular cognitive impairment and dementia","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Cognition (Cognitive Decline)","description":"Serial telephone-based cognitive assessments will be performed to detect cognitive changes (cognitive decline).","timeFrame":"Assessments occur every 6 months for 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke demonstrated on an MRI scan that includes perfusion imaging with an exogenous contrast agent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to perform telephone-based cognitive assessments","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients who are admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with an ischemic stroke based on an MRI scan that also includes perfusion imaging with an exogenous contrast agent and are will/able to be contacted for serial phone-based cognitive evaluations.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Pooja Patel","role":"CONTACT","phone":"410 502 5355","email":"ppate120@jhmi.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Richard Leigh, MD","affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Johns Hopkins Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21287","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Pooja Patel","role":"CONTACT","phone":"410-502-5355","email":"ppate120@jhmi.edu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"There is currently no plan to share IPD with other researchers"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000060825","term":"Cognitive Dysfunction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000003072","term":"Cognition Disorders"},{"id":"D000019965","term":"Neurocognitive Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6594","name":"Dementia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M29395","name":"Cognitive Dysfunction","asFound":"Cognitive Decline","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3575","name":"Alzheimer Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5991","name":"Cognition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21526","name":"Neurocognitive Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T2192","name":"Familial Alzheimer Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
