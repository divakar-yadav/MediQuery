Physiotherapy is focused on muscle strengthening, real floor walking and stairs climbing tasks, but these methods do not stress in terms of intensity stair-climbing practice. The aims of this study is to compare whether an intensive robot-assisted stair climbing training (RASCT) is more effective than conventional physiotherapy (CP) for improving stair climbing ability, gait and postural control in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Trial design: A pilot randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), single blind clinical trial (RCT) comparing the effects between the experimental \\[Robot-Assisted Stair Climbing Training group (RASCT)\\] and control group (Conventional Physiotherapy, CP) in improving stair climbing ability and postural control in stroke patients.

The PIs will be responsible for the randomization procedures. If eligible, patients will be randomly allocated (allocation ratio 1:1) to the experimental (EG) or conventional physiotherapy (CP) using computer-generated random numbers (www.randomization.com). In each site, one examiner blinded to group assignment will be responsible for assessments.\n\nPrior to the start of the study the EG and CP protocols will be designed. To ensure uniformity in the delivery of treatments, one therapist from each center will be taught to training protocols by the research collaborators. Participants will receive 50-min, individual treatment sessions as outpatients 2 days a week for 5 consecutive weeks, for a total of 10 sessions. For each Unit one physiotherapist will be assigned to the EG and one to the CP.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-Assisted Stair Climbing Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each session will consist of the G-EO System training and stretching exercises.

The G-EO Systems rehabilitation robot allows to secure the subjects with a harness while they stood on the foot plates of the machine. The foot plates has 3 DoF each, allowing to control the length and the height of the steps and the foot plate angles. The maximum step length corresponded to 550 mm, the maximum achievable height of the steps is 400 mm, the maximum angles is ±90°.
