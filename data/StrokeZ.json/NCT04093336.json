Phase I study is a safety assessment and Phase 2 study is incline to assess effectiveness of MSCs. Potential subjects must be screened and consented before enrolled.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of early intravenous infusion of allogeneic human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs or MSCs used in the following section) for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Eligible patients will receive a single dose of MSCs or placebo within 24 hours after stroke. Patients will be followed for 2 years post infusion for safety and efficacy (change in neurological symptoms and quality of life). Assessments will occur during transplantation and at 3,7, 14 days and1,3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after infusions of stem cells.","detailedDescription":"In Phase 1 study, the eligible patients of acute cerebral infarction within 7 days after onset will be randomized to MSCs group or control group and receive intravenous MSCs 2 x 10\\^6/kg or placebo as a single dose, respectively. Each group will enroll 10 patients and patients will be followed for 2 years to observe the adverse events and evaluate the safety of MSCs for acute ischemic stroke patients.\n\nThe safety and preliminary effectiveness of MSCs in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction will be summarized after all patients of Phase 1 study were followed for 3 months post infusion, and the report will be submit to the academic committee and the ethics committee to evaluate before approval to begin the Phase 2 study.\n\nIn Phase 2 study, 100 patients with acute infarction within 24 hours after onset will be enrolled and randomized to MSCs group or control group. Patients will have baseline laboratory examinations and cerebral image (MRI or CTP). Enrolled patients will receive intravenous infusion of 2\\*10\\^6/kg MSCs or placebo for a single dose and follow for 24 months to assess the adverse events, neurological functional recovery and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery","Infarction, Anterior Cerebral Artery","Cerebral Infarction","Stroke, Ischemic","Acute Stroke","Brain Infarction","Infarction, PCA","Infarction, Posterior Circulation, Brain"],"keywords":["Acute cerebral infarction ,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"placebo controlled, randomized, double blinded","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MSCs group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The people in this group will receive intravenous MSCs 2 x 10\\^6/kg as a single dose and standardized treatment of acute ischemic stroke.","interventionNames":["Biological: human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells","Other: standardized treatment"]},{"label":"control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The people in this group will receive placebo and standardized treatment of acute ischemic stroke.","interventionNames":["Biological: Placebo","Other: standardized treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells","description":"The MSCs was intravenous transplanted to acute cerebral infarction patients as a single dose.","armGroupLabels":["MSCs group"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["control group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"standardized treatment","description":"standardized treatment","armGroupLabels":["MSCs group","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"adverse events","description":"include tumorigenesis, death, pulmonary embolism, allergy, newly cerebrovascular events and other adverse events to evaluate the safety of MSCs for acute ischemic stroke patients","timeFrame":"24 months post transplantation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 3 months","description":"The NIHSS neurologic examination includes 15 individual elements that measure motor and sensory function, language and speech production, vision, level of consciousness and attention, and neglect.
