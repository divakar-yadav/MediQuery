This study is a parallel, three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Each participant will be randomized into one of the treatment arms; face-to-face BBTI, internet-based BBTI, and waiting-list. The BBTI, emphasizes behavioral aspects of insomnia care, arises from techniques of sleep restriction and stimulus control. The face-to-face and internet-based BBTI have equivalent content based on the standard portion. All participants will be asked to fill the online questionnaires at weeks 0 (baseline), 1 (mid-treatment), 2 (post-treatment), 4, and 12 (follow up). After the final follow-up, the waiting-list participants will be allowed to join the internet-based BBTI treatment. Our hypotheses are that patients with stroke who receive face-to-face or internet-based BBTI, compared to a wait-list condition, will experience fewer insomnia complaints.","detailedDescription":"Post-stroke insomnia is a common complaint with prevalence rates remain high. Patients suffering from insomnia following stroke could impair their health-related quality of life and negative rehabilitation outcomes. Identifying effective treatment in managing post-stroke insomnia has become clinically relevant.\n\nBrief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBTI), a 4-section of treatment for insomnia, has similar treatment components with CBTI, with the exception of cognitive therapy. Previous evidence found that both BBTI and CBTI have comparable effects on improving sleep quality and consolidation. Existing literature has suggested that BBTI was effective on mitigating primary and comorbid insomnia. Nonetheless, thus far, no study has explored its effects in stroke population. Of note, BBTI still requires certain contact with therapists. To enhance the widespread dissemination of BBTI, it is important to establish the internet-based BBTI treatment model (more flexible time schedule) to target more populations with insomnia. The recent study of the online tailored BBTI has proven the comparable effects to reduce insomnia severity in the general population. However, no study investigates the efficacy of internet-based nurse-led BBTI in the stroke population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Insomnia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"During the trial, the data collector will be blinded to the random assignment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Face-to-face BBTI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The BBTI consists of two in-person sessions on week 1 and 3 and two session on week 2 and 4 as the \"booster\" delivered by phone call.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Brief Behavior Therapy for Insomnia"]},{"label":"Web-based BBTI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The BBTI consists of two in-person sessions on week 1 and 3 and two session on week 2 and 4 as the \"booster\" delivered by phone call.
