To avoid the wound caused by gastrostomy, nasogastric tube feeding has been the mainstay of palliation, but potential side effects exist this choice. Intermittent Oro-esophageal tube feeding is an established modality that can be used with comprehensive rehabilitation therapy. This study reports the outcomes of Intermittent Oro-esophageal tube feeding and comparison with nasogastric tube feeding, including nutritional status, dysphagia, quality of life, depression, and follow-up in patients receiving comprehensive rehabilitation therapy.This was a prospective multicenter study. the patients after stroke with were randomly divided into the observation group and the control group.

Before each feeding, the infant's oral and nasal secretions were to be cleared. An intermittent oro-esophageal tube was appropriately lubricated with water on the head part. The professional medical staff held the tube and slowly inserted it through one side of the mouth into the upper part of the esophagus. The depth of insertion depended on the patient's age and height. After each feeding, the tube was immediately removed, and the patient was held upright for at least 30 minutes in case of reflux.","armGroupLabels":["the observation group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Nasogastric Tube Feeding","description":"Nasogastric Tube Feeding were used for feeding to provide nutritional support. Each feeding was administered by a nurse using the infant's mother's breast milk through the tube. The amount of each feeding varied from 20 to 100 ml depending on the age of the infant, with feedings given every 2 to 3 hours, approximately 10 times per day. The duration of each feeding procedure ranged from 10 to 20 minutes. The total daily intake ranged from 200 to 1000 ml. Each tube was kept indwelling for 5 to 7 days. When the tube needed to be replaced, it was removed after the last feeding of a day and a new tube was to be inserted through the other nostril on the following morning to continue the nutritional support.","armGroupLabels":["the control group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"comprehensive rehabilitation therapy","description":"Both groups were given comprehensive rehabilitation therapy.
