A group of subacute stroke patients was treated with the device named NEUROExos Elbow Module (NEEM) on a daily basis, in addition to traditional physical therapy. The outcome was assessed in terms of (i) system safety, (ii) system usability and (iii) treatment efficacy.\n\nInvestigators expected that intense therapy performed in the sub-acute phase following the stroke would be effective in preventing elbow spasticity from occurring at a later stage (i.e. 3-4 months after the stroke), the latter being quantified by means of the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Similarly to other phase-II studies in the field of post-stroke rehabilitation, the present study will include only one group of patients. As a secondary objective, similarly to other studies with robot-assisted therapy, investigators wiil test the ability of this system to be used for assessing rehabilitation outcome. Investigators will introduce novel evaluation metrics based on the kinematics and kinetics variables recorded by the NEEM and compared them with MAS values."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Muscle Spasticity","Stroke"],"keywords":["Robotics","Upper Extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Subacute stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Elbow passive/active robotic treatment provided by NEUROExos Elbow Module","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic treatment","description":"Passive/active elbow mobilizzation provided by NEUROExos Elbow Module Robotic device","armGroupLabels":["Subacute stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Impairmente level maesure according to ICF","timeFrame":"2 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Range of Motion","description":"Impairmente level maesure according to ICF","timeFrame":"2 weeks"},{"measure":"Maximum Extension Torque","description":"Paramenter directly exterted by the device","timeFrame":"2 weeks"},{"measure":"Zero-Torque Angle","description":"Paramenter directly exterted by the device","timeFrame":"2 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
