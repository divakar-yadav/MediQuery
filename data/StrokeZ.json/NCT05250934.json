Rehabilitation treatment is a long and costly process, the effectiveness of which is supported by strong scientific evidence. In recent years, technology has spread to the rehabilitation field and, to date, the use of rehabilitation robotics, in addition to conventional treatment, is recommended by some stroke guidelines. The coronavirus pandemic has required a reorganization of rehabilitation services, but also an enhancement of technology as a tool in the rehabilitation field that can allow treatment in compliance with social distancing. Many scientific works have in fact confirmed the usefulness of these approaches to overcome the limits imposed by the pandemic, in particular for the treatment of disabilities in stroke patients.\n\nThe rehabilitation robot Icone (CE marked medical device, Class II-A, produced by Heaxel), is a device with certification for home use and therefore suitable for telerehabilitation. The proposed study aims to test the feasibility of rehabilitation treatment in a home setting based on a system of telecounseling, telemonitoring and robotic telerehabilitation using the robot Icone and integrated sensors for patients with stroke, to overcome the limits imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPatients undergo robotic telerehabilitation treatment, carried out at home. The patient is supervised by a caregiver and, remotely, by a multidisciplinary team thanks to the use of webcams and sensors embedded in the robot. The evaluations, through clinical scales and instrumental evaluations, are carried out both in presence (at the enrollment and the end of the study) and remotely (before the first telerobotic rehabilitation session, in the middle and after the last telerobotic rehabilitation session). The study is included in the Regional Smart Specialization Strategy (S3 - Biorobotics for rehabilitation) for business \\& life continuity and co-financed by the European Union through LazioInnova"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Robotic rehabilitation","Telerehabilitation","Upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the robotic group, each patient undergoes 20 upper limb robotic telerehabilitation sessions, each session lasting 1 hour.

The proposed exercises require the patient to move a cursor on the screen using the end-effector of the robot to reach specific points (planar reaching exercises). When the patient is able to perform these exercises independently, the robot assists the movement by minimizing the interaction force applied to the hand and limiting itself to acquiring the kinematic and dynamic parameters of the exercise, which are useful in determining the state of motor skills. Icone assist the subject by applying a force to his hand that helps him complete the task in the phases where the patient plans the movement correctly but is unable to complete it. As a result, the system will enable you to perform planar elbow and shoulder movements in active, passive, or active-assisted modes, with visual and acoustic feedback.","armGroupLabels":["Robotic group"],"otherNames":["Icone (Heaxel)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in Fugl-meyer Assessment Upper Extremity motor functioning","description":"It is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
