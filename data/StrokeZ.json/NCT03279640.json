Recently, more challenging approaches, such as stimulation of two or more sites or use of dual modality have been studied in stroke patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both rTMS and tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) was investigated to compare its modulatory effects with single rTMS stimulation in subacute stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Investigators assessed each patient's motor function using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score and acquired their resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data at two times: prior to stimulation and 2 months after stimulation. Changes in rs-fMRI network measures were investigated between groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Motor Disorder"],"keywords":["Motor Network","Resting-state fMRI","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual-mode stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"rTMS on ipsilesional M1 + tDCS on contralesional M1\n\n10 Hz of rTMS was applied over the ipsilesional M1 for 20 minutes with simultaneous application of cathodal tDCS on the contralesional M1.\n\nEach participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.","interventionNames":["Device: rTMS on ipsilesional M1","Device: tDCS on contralesional M1"]},{"label":"Single stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"rTMS on ipsilesional M1\n\n10 Hz of rTMS over the ipsilesional M1 was applied for 20 minutes.\n\nEach participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.","interventionNames":["Device: rTMS on ipsilesional M1"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"rTMS on ipsilesional M1","armGroupLabels":["Dual-mode stimulation","Single stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS on contralesional M1","armGroupLabels":["Dual-mode stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neuroimaging Assessment","description":"Resting-state fMRI","timeFrame":"Change from baseline resting-state brain network at 8 weeks after intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* First-ever stroke patients\n* Subacute stage (less than 4 weeks)\n* Total Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score under 84\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Major active neurological disease or psychiatric disease\n* A history of seizure\n* Metallic implants in their brain","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yun-Hee Kim, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29666636","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Lee J, Park E, Lee A, Chang WH, Kim DS, Shin YI, Kim YH.
