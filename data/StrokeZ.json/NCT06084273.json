All patients received the same Bobath exercise three days a week for six weeks. Patients in Group 2 additionally received breathing and relaxation exercises. Sleep quality assessment by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PUKI), depression by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and spasticity by Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) were used. All assessments were made at baseline and six weeks after exercise treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Depression","Exercise","Relaxation","Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bobath Exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Bobath Exercises","interventionNames":["Other: Bobath Exercises"]},{"label":"Breathing Exercises,Breathing Exercises, Bobath Exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Breathing Exercises,Breathing Exercises, Bobath Exercises","interventionNames":["Other: Bobath Exercises","Other: Breathing Exercises,Breathing Exercises, Bobath Exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bobath Exercises","description":"The Bobath approach aims to enhance postural and neuromotor control goal-directedly, leading to functional improvement.

During the exercise, the individual is asked to follow these steps:\n\n1. Breathe calmly and slowly through the nose.\n2. Pucker the lips as if whistling or inflating a balloon.\n3. Exhale the breath with puckered lips. Relaxation exercises Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique: Progressive muscle relaxation is one of the easiest methods to learn and apply, developed by Jacobson. It involves voluntarily tensing and relaxing large muscle groups regularly and sequentially. The participant was encouraged to wear comfortable clothing, breathe deeply, and exhale. The technique can be performed in a sitting or lying position. Music can be played to contribute to the participant's relaxation.","armGroupLabels":["Breathing Exercises,Breathing Exercises, Bobath Exercises"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sleep quality assessment","description":"The subjective sleep questionnaire, the PUKI, is used to assess individuals' sleep quality, sleep duration, presence of sleep problems, and the severity of sleep problems over the past month.","timeFrame":"30 min"},{"measure":"Depression assessment","description":"The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessment scale developed to determine the risk, level, and severity of anxiety and depression in individuals","timeFrame":"30 min"},{"measure":"Spasticity assessment","description":"Spasticity is a method used to determine the severity of spasticity.
