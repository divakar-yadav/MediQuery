In this clinical trial, rtPA will be injected intravenously using an infusion device. If reperfusion is not occur in spite of rtPA therapy, endovascular therapy can be performed.","detailedDescription":"This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of SP-8203 and rtPA in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving rtPA standard of care.\n\nAs the standard procedure of rtPA therapy, rtPA will be injected intravenously using an infusion device. When reperfusion is not achieved in spite of rtPA therapy, endovascular therapy can be performed according to the judgment of a site investigator.\n\nA total of 178 subjects will be enrolled in double-blind, randomized and parallel design with 89 subjects assigned to 80 mg/day SP-8203 group or placebo group, respectively.\n\nIf a subject, who is able to be enrolled, has neurologic deficit of ≥4 point on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and give his/her consent to participate in the trial, each treatment is administered after the investigational product is randomly assigned by institution after sequential allocation. The randomization number of patients is the same as the assigned number of the investigational product administered to the patients. The subject will receive the Investigational products a total of 6 times, with 12 hours intervals. Only for the patients who consent, blood sample will be taken after the sixth administration of the Investigational product for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics analysis. For pharmacokinetic profile analysis, blood sample will be taken at 0\\~5, 30±5, and 120±5 minutes after the complete sixth administration of the investigational products. For pharmacodynamic profile analysis, blood sample will be taken at between 24 to 48 hours after the first administration, at 0 minute after the sixth administration and at 4th week visit. The first blood sampling time is set to after 24 hours because of the patient's stability, but it can be performed before the investigational product has been administered in accordance with the judgment of the investigators.\n\nThe subject will have brain initial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) performed within 6 hours before and after the administration of investigational product, and brain Computed Tomography (CT) will be performed at 24±3 hours after completion of the first administration of investigational products.\n\nBrain MRI and MRA will be followed-up on Day 5, and additionally the subject will make a visit for close monitoring for his/her neurologic condition at 4th week and 12th week. Thereafter, all the procedures of the clinical trial will be completed.\n\nWhen unexpected serious adverse reaction occurs during the clinical trial, the safety of subjects who participated in clinical trial and the clinical trial itself is objectively validated through the convocation and evaluation by Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["SP-8203 (Otaplimastat)","rtPA (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":178,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SP-8203","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SP-8203 80 mg (40 mg/dose twice a day for three days)","interventionNames":["Drug: SP-8203"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo group: twice a day for three days","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"SP-8203","description":"SP-8203 80 mg will be intravenously administered as 40 mg/dose twice daily (intervals of 12 hours)","armGroupLabels":["SP-8203"],"otherNames":["Otaplimastat (SP-8203)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo will be intravenously administered twice daily (intervals of 12 hours)","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The neurological improvement evaluated by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","description":"The neurological improvement evaluated by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) until 28 day in subjects with acute ischemic stroke requiring rtPA (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator) standard of care.
