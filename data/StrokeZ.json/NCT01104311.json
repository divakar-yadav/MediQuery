Current guidelines defined the normal BP as \\<120/80mmHg and recommend individualized target BP level.\n\nLarge well performed stroke prevention trials consistently showed that reduction of 10/5mmHg in patients with systolic BP below 140mmHg had clear benefits in the prevention of cardiovascular events. However, we have a dilemma about BP control in the patients with severe intracranial atherosclerosis.\n\nAggressive BP control will be more effective in the prevention of overall cardiovascular events than modest BP control, but aggressive BP control will reduce cerebral perfusion in the territory of severe intracranial disease and may increase the risk of ischemic damage.\n\nThe study will try to reveal aggressive BP control in the patients with symptomatic severe intracranial atherosclerosis is not increase ischemic lesion volume in hemisphere to compare modest BP control."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia"],"keywords":["Blood Pressure","Atherosclerosis","Brain
