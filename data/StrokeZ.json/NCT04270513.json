Flying Intervention Team service runs from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Patients remain at local stroke unit for further treatment.\n\nAnalysis will include time delay to EVT, recanalization, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, periprocedural complications, in-hospital complications, and mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Infarction"],"keywords":["endovascular
