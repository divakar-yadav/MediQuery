The main question it aims to answer is whether strength and movement in the upper arm be improved by use of the gaming system.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete initial measurements of upper arm function, play a video game for one hour, four times a week for five weeks, and repeat the measurements of upper arm function at the end."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single subject case study","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Virtual reality gaming"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Virtual reality gaming","description":"This study aims to combine the motivational delivery of therapy which is an immersive virtual reality with the foundational concepts of mirror therapy. By utilizing a recalibration software, the participant will be able to achieve magnified movements on their screen as compared to the limited movement that is occurring in reality. The recalibration software takes each plane of movement of the gaming controller and magnifies the participant's range of motion in order to promote greater participation and success in the game that they are playing (Walkin VR). By using the fundamental concepts of mirror therapy in an immersive virtual reality setting, the investigators aim to mimic the results of mirror therapy while increasing motivation and adherence to the therapeutic program to increase overall upper extremity function.","armGroupLabels":["Single subject case study"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in upper extremity active range of motion","description":"Measured via goniometer","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in grip strength","description":"Measured via hand dynamometer","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in aerobic fitness","description":"Measured via oxygen consumption using a wearable metabolic monitor while pedaling an arm bike","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Self-reported diagnosis of stroke\n* Greater than 2 years post-stroke\n* Access to reliable transportation\n* History of weakness/hemiparesis of one upper limb\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Significant vision impairment or blindness\n* Non-English speaking\n* History of seizure or seizure disorder\n* Health conditions which would be exacerbated by low-intensity exercise\n* Inability to use arms independently for exercise","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jason Vice, PhD","affiliation":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UAB Lakeshore Foundation Research Collaborative","city":"Birmingham","state":"Alabama","zip":"35294","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":33.52066,"lon":-86.80249}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25206611","type":"RESULT","citation":"Bao X, Mao Y, Lin Q, Qiu Y, Chen S, Li L, Cates RS, Zhou S, Huang D.
