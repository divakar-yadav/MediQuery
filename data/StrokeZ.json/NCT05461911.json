Several studies, including the US National Long-term Treatment of Pressure Ulcers Study, have shown that weight loss and malnutrition were associated with a higher risk of pressure ulcers.\n\nOne of the successful products specially created for the treatment of pressure ulcers and taking into account the results of research is the high-protein, energy-rich, ready-to-use enteral tube feeding food product Nutrison Advanced Cubison. It is a complete enteral nutritional supplement with an innovative nutrient composition for patients with chronic wounds, including pressure ulcers, or at increased risk of developing them.\n\nTaking into account the available data, it seems expedient to continue studying the unique combination of nutrients that make up the study food product Nutrison Advanced Cubison in order to develop the most effective nutritional protocols for patients at risk for the treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pressure Ulcer ( Stage 2-3)"],"keywords":["Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The Study Group","description":"30 adult patients aged 30-75 years to receive a specialized tube feeding product Nutrison Advanced Cubison (20% protein energy 100 kcal, 5.5 g protein, 0.85 g arginine, 38 mg of vitamin C and 2 mg of zinc) in a volume not exceeding 1.5 liters / day and, if necessary, to replenish nutritional needs based on the total daily intake of 30-35 kcal / kg / day and 1.2-1.5 g of protein / kg body weight / day according to the recommendations for nutritional support for patients with pressure ulcers during the entire observation period","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Nutrison Advanced Cubison"]},{"label":"The Control Group","description":"30 patients aged 30-75 years to receive a standard (available in the clinic) tube feeding product (energetically similar to the product in group 1) with a standard content of arginine, vitamins and minerals from calculating the total daily intake of 30-35 kcal / kg / day and 1.2-1.5 g protein / kg body weight / day according to the recommendations for nutritional support for patients with pressure ulcers during the entire observation period"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Nutrison Advanced Cubison","description":"(20% protein energy 100 kcal, 5.5 g protein, 0.85 g arginine, 38 mg of vitamin C and 2 mg of zinc) in a volume not exceeding 1.5 liters / day and, if necessary, to replenish nutritional needs based on the total daily intake of 30-35 kcal / kg / day and 1.2-1.5 g of protein / kg body weight / day according to the recommendations for nutritional support","armGroupLabels":["The Study Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in the area of pressure ulcers in both groups during the study","timeFrame":"up to 4 weeks"},{"measure":"The proportion of patients in both groups with a decrease in the area of the pressure ulcer by 20% or more by the date of completion of observations","timeFrame":"up to 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing values in both groups during the study","description":"Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) is a common tool to monitor pressure healing over time.
