The investigational plan also examines the following outcomes in 85 subjects randomized to either hypothermia or normothermia:\n\n* Regulation of biomarkers indicative of ischemia-reperfusion injury\n* Changes in blood brain injury using the Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM) protocol MRI as a surrogate imaging biomarker\n* Incidence of hemorrhagic conversion post reperfusion\n* Neurologic function at 90 days post acute ischemic stroke. The results of this study will be used to power a definitive phase III clinical trial evaluating the combination of hypothermia and revascularization versus reperfusion alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hypothermia"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Mild Hypothermia","Stroke","Hypothermia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normothermia","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"As part of standard of care, an interventional reperfusion procedure will be performed on all subjects using current FDA approved devices.
