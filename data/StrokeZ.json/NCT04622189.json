Furthermore, this study assess the perception of applicability and satisfaction degree for this kind of treatments.","detailedDescription":"After being informed about the study, all patients give written informed consent and will undergo a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. Patient who meet the eligibility requirements will be given clinical and instrumental assessments before the start of treatment (T0) after 3 weeks (T1), at the end of the treatment (T2) and after 6 months (T3). A training program of 4 weeks including 250 videos of every day actions has been developed. Videos includes transitive and intransitive actions. Each week has a five day program, each day is divided in three sessions, in each session there are observation and imitation and attentional questions. AOT is always performed in conjunction with the conventional rehabilitation program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","AOT","kinematic","brain plasticity","mirror neuron system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Action observation training for the upper limb rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neurorehabilitation training for the upper limb using AOT consists of watching videos related to every day actions. The subjects will be asked to reproduce, as accurately as possible, the actions proposed by the system, that will record their execution. In order to keep high motivation and participation in activities, simple games of skill will also be created that will involve the patient on both the motor and cognitive side.
