Dichotomized mRS at 90 days after the operation (0-1 versus 2-6, 0-3 versus 4-6, 0-4 versus 5-6, 0-5 versus 6).\n2. Change in stroke severity (NIHSS score) at 24 hours post treatment.\n3. Change in stroke severity (NIHSS score) at 7 days post treatment or discharge (whichever occurs first).\n4. Final infarct volume at 5-7 days\n5. Technical success rate (defined as successfully navigating the guide catheter into the target vessel, and finishing the mechanical thrombectomy procedure without changing to another guide catheter).\n6. Reperfusion outcome (eTICI 2b or greater, eTICI 2c or greater, eTICI 3) in final angiogram.\n7. Reperfusion outcome (eTICI 2b or greater, eTICI 2c or greater, eTICI 3) after the first pass.\n8. Time from groin puncture to successful reperfusion (eTICI 2b or greater, eTICI 2c or greater).\n9. Percentage of subjects with acceptable revascularization quality (eTICI 2b or greater, eTICI 2c or greater) within 45 min of access.\n10. Number of thrombectomy attempts (final).\n11. Occurrence of emboli to a new territory.\n\nSafety Endpoints:\n\n1. Deaths at 90 days (±14 days) post treatment.\n2. Intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 7 days post treatment or discharge (whichever occurs first).\n3. Other serious adverse events (SAEs) adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee.\n4.
