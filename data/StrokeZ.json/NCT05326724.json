Approximately 21.5% of patients develop dementia within 4 years after stroke. The main clinical manifestation of dementia is memory and cognitive impairment. At present, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, were used for dementia treatment, but those drugs have limited efficacy. Exosome is an extracellular vesicle from the endosomal, size range from \\~40 to 160 nm (average \\~100 nm). It contains many cells including DNA, RNA, fat, and metabolites, as well as cytoplasm and cell surface proteins that play a role in regulating intercellular communication. Some studies believe that exosomes in the circulation are an ideal marker to reflect the pathological progress and recovery of stroke, and play a key role in the reorganization of tissues and the progress of neurodegeneration after stroke. Our previous studies have known that acupuncture can increase the long-term potentiation of hippocampal CA1 in rats with ischemic stroke, and improve learning-memory and neurological function. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the role of acupuncture-induced exosome in the treatment of post-stroke dementia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Exosome","Post-stroke Dementia","Acupuncture"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acupuncture","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Acupuncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Acupuncture","description":"The stainless steel needles are used to insert into the three points of Sishencong and the Baihui, and the Dazhui, once a week, once for 20 minutes, for 12 consecutive weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Acupuncture"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"concentration of Exosome","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale scale","description":"Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia scale","description":"The greater cognitive impairment or dementia severity is associated with higher rates of some BPSD (Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia ).","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
