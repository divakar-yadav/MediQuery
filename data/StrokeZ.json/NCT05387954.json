Oral anticoagulant therapy is also a logical approach assuming that PFO-related strokes are due to paradoxical embolism which implies a venous source of embolism, or to direct embolization of a thrombus formed at the atrial level. The CLOSE trial also suggested that oral anticoagulants might reduce stroke recurrence compared to aspirin.\n\nThere is accumulating evidence that presence of a PFO is significantly associated with cryptogenic stroke in patients over 60 years. Cryptogenic ischemic strokes represent about one third of all ischemic strokes in patients older than 60 years. However, the optimal therapeutic strategy in patients older than 60 years with a PFO and an otherwise unexplained ischemic stroke is unknown, because these patients were excluded from randomized trials.\n\nThe hypothesis tested in this trial is that transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy is superior to antiplatelet therapy alone and that oral anticoagulant therapy is superior to antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in patients aged 60 to 80 years who have a high-risk PFO and a recent otherwise unexplained ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cryptogenic Ischemic Stroke","Patent Foramen Ovale"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Cryptogenic stroke","Patent foramen ovale","Atrial septal
