Current American Stroke Association (ASA) and European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines recommend bridging therapy with IVT for all eligible patients before indicating endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for those with large vessel occlusions (LVO). Nevertheless, the decision to use IVT on stroke patients with LVO is still debatable, with many arguments against and supporting combined therapy or direct mechanical thrombectomy. At present, guideline in our hospital advocates the use of IVT in all patients who meet eligibility criteria and present within the 4,5 hour window for anterior circulation stroke and within 24 hour window for posterior circulation stroke. Due to the overcrowded nature of our center as a high-end specialization establishment in Vietnam, it is noted that our door-to-groin time is sub-optimal. This fact inadvertently prolongs the time of action of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator before the re-assessment of occlusion site on interventional radiography. Therefore, it is possible for us to better estimate the reperfusion effectiveness of IVT as well as analyse other factors that might have an influence on this rate. The goal of our study is to determine the recanalization rate of IVT and related predictor factors in AIS patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["reperfusion","IVT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"7 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Plasminogen Activators","description":"standard dosage of 0.9 mg/kg or reduced dosage of 0.6 mg/kg, divided into a 15% bolus and an 85% venous infusion"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"reperfusion rate","description":"the reperfusion rate of intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion first confirmed by angiography and assessed later by a vascular imaging modality.","timeFrame":"within 24 hours of hospitalization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage","description":"incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage 48 hours after initiation of IVT","timeFrame":"48 hours after initiation of IVT"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
