The primary purpose of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-parallel controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shuxuening injection in the treatment with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA within the time window is the most effective drug for acute ischemic stroke, but there are still more than 50% patients with functional disability. Neuroprotective agents can reduce brain cell death after cerebral ischemia by blocking all links of ischemic cascade. Shuxuening injection is a multi-target neuroprotective agent, it is expected to play a neuroprotective role on the basis of intravenous thrombolysis therapy.\n\nThis study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-parallel controlled trial. A total of 1380 patients from 50 centers in China who could be treated within 6 hours of onset and have received or plan to undergo intravenous thrombolytic therapy will be enrolled and randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive Shuxuening injection (20 ml Shuxuening injection + 250 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection), or to receive Shuxuening injection placebo (20 ml plus 250 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection); both groups are treated for 10-14 days. The primary efficacy outcome is mRS Score 0 to 1 at 90 days, and the primary safety outcome is adverse events within 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Intravenous Thrombolysis","Neuroprotective Therapy","Shuxuening Injection","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1380,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Shuxuening injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Shuxuening Injection + Intravenous Thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Drug: Shuxuening Injection"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo + Intravenous Thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Shuxuening Injection","description":"Receiving 20 ml Shuxuening injection plus 250ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection, intravenous drip once a day, for 10-14 days","armGroupLabels":["Shuxuening injection"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Receiving 20 ml placebo Shuxuening injection plus 250ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection, intravenous drip once a day, for 10-14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of mRS score 0 to 1 at 90 days after randomization","description":"The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse functional outcome.","timeFrame":"At 90 days after randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of mRS score 0 to 2 at 90 days after randomization","description":"The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse functional outcome.","timeFrame":"At 90 days after randomization"},{"measure":"The distribution of mRS scores at 90 days after randomization","description":"The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse functional outcome.","timeFrame":"At 90 days after randomization"},{"measure":"NIHSS score improvement ≥4 points from baseline at 14 days after randomization or on discharge","description":"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe neurological deficit.","timeFrame":"At 14 days after randomization or on discharge"},{"measure":"EQ-5D score at 90 days after randomization","description":"The European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 3-Level (EQ-5D-3L) includes five dimensions.
