This is a randomized prospective study to assess if there is a difference in first pass reperfusion at two centers with large mechanical thrombectomy volumes. Data will also be collected on time-to treatment, outcomes and hemorrhagic complications.","detailedDescription":"The SOLTRAP Study is an investigator initiated two hospital study designed to assess the procedural success and clinical outcomes associated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Medtronic Solitaire Device and the Cerenovous Embotrap device. Both devices are FDA approved for this indication of removal of a thrombus for patients suffering from stroke secondary to a large vessel occlusion.\n\nData collected will include device used during the procedure, mechanical thrombectomy techniques, time from onset to imaging, imaging to puncture, and overall time from onset to reperfusion as well as quality of life at 90 days post stroke.\n\nThe study will enroll up to 418 subjects and will be conducted at Wellstar North Fulton Hospital and Wellstar Kennestone Hospital. The devices will have regulatory authorization to be on the market in the geographic location of both sites.\n\nThe duration of the Registry protocol is approximately 24 months"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":418,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS)","description":"Patients who experienced acute ischemic stroke (AIS), eligible for restoration of blood flow using a Solitaire or Embotrap device to remove thrombus from the neurovasculature","interventionNames":["Device: Stent Retrievers","Device: Stent Retriever"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Stent Retrievers","description":"Procedure: Embotrap device","armGroupLabels":["Acute ischemic stroke (AIS)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Stent Retriever","description":"Procedure: Solitaire device","armGroupLabels":["Acute ischemic stroke (AIS)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Severity of Disability","description":"assessed by mRS with a good functional outcome defined as mRS of 0-2 for each technique","timeFrame":"Day 90 (+14)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Excellent functional outcome","description":"defined as mRS 0-1 at Day 90","timeFrame":"Day 90 (+14)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects who experienced acute ischemic stroke (AIS), eligible for restoration of blood flow using a Solitaire or Embotrap device to remove thrombus from the neurovasculature\n2. Occlusion of intracranial cerebral circulation vessel involving the M1, M2 MCA or ICA-T (Tandem occlusions will be enrolled)\n3. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) has signed the informed consent form prior to or within 72 hours post-procedure\n4. Subject is willing to comply with the protocol follow-up requirements\n5. The intended technique and treated technique must be one of the following techniques for the first thrombectomy pass in the neurovasculature per Instructions for Use (IFU).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.The subject can participate in another clinical trial if the study does not impact the endpoints defined in this protocol given this is a data collection trial. Patients who are unable to comply wit the 90 day follow up in person or via telephone will be excluded from the study.","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Subjects who experienced acute ischemic stroke (AIS), eligible for restoration of blood flow using a Solitaire or Embotrap device to remove thrombus from the neurovasculature","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Wellstar Kennestone Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Marietta","state":"Georgia","zip":"30060","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Erica Ononiwu","role":"CONTACT","phone":"470-793-4554","email":"Erica.ononiwu@wellstar.org"},{"name":"Wellstar Research Institute","role":"CONTACT","email":"research@wellstar.org"},{"name":"Benjamin Zussman, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.9526,"lon":-84.54993}},{"facility":"Wellstar North Fulton Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Roswell","state":"Georgia","zip":"30076","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Erica Ononiwe","role":"CONTACT","phone":"470-793-7554","email":"Erica.ononiwu@wellstar.org"},{"name":"Benjamin Zussman, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":34.02316,"lon":-84.36159}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
