Good to excellent reliability (ICC range, 0.84 -0.99) has been reported for lower-limb hand-held dynamometer strength measurements of subjects with neurologic conditions \\[49\\]. Each subject will complete three trials in which maximal force is generated for 2 to 3 seconds ffrom each muscle. The average of the three readings will be used for data analysis.","timeFrame":"4 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dynamic standing balance","description":"The step test (ST) will be used to measure dynamic standing balance of both the paretic and normal limbs. It measures the number of times a subject is able to place one foot on a step 7.5cm high and back to the ground, as fast as possible, within 15 seconds. Three trials will be performed with each leg, with 1 minute of rest between trials to minimize fatigue. ST scores show excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability with subjects with chronic stroke.","timeFrame":"4 years"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lower-extremity motor coordination","description":"The lower-extremity motor coordination test (LEMOCOT) will be used to measure the coordination of both the paretic and normal legs \\[50\\]. The LEMOCOT has been demonstrated as having good reliability (ICC=0.83-0.88) for subjects with subacute stroke \\[50\\]. Two red flat targets will be secured on the floor 30cm apart. The test will be performed while the subject is seated on a chair without armrests, with the knees flexed at close to 90o, the feet resting flat on the floor, and the heels on one of the targets. The subject will be instructed to touch the 2 targets alternately with the big toe, as quickly and as accurately as possible, for 20 seconds. The number of times each target is touched will be counted. The first trial will be a practice trial, with the average of the second and third trials used for analysis.","timeFrame":"4 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects will be recruited from local self-help groups through poster advertising. \\\\\n* Subjects will be included if they (1) are between 55 and 85 years of age\n* Have been diagnosed with ischaemic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage by MRI or computed tomography within the previous 1 to 10 years\n* Are able to walk 3 metres independently with or without a walking aid\n* Are able to score \\> 6 out of 10 on the abbreviated mental test\n* Are able to follow instructions and give informed consent\n* Have no skin allergy which would prevent electrical stimulation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects will be excluded if they have any additional medical, cardiovascular or orthopedic condition that would hinder proper treatment or assessment\n* Use a cardiac pacemaker\n* Have receptive dysphasia\n* Have significant lower limb peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetic polyneuropathy)\n* Are involved in drug studies or other clinical trials.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"55 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","city":"Hong Kong","zip":"Hong Kong","country":"Hong Kong","geoPoint":{"lat":22.27832,"lon":114.17469}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29437598","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Kwong PWH, Ng GYF, Chung RCK, Ng SSM.
