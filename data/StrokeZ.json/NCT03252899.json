The survey consisted out of 30 questions enquiring personal information and upper limb specific topics divided in 3 sections: (1) Passive mobilization, (2) Active exercises and (3) Immobilization. The survey took approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete.\n\nThe survey for stroke survivors was divided in seven sections: (1) Personal information (2) Motor recovery of the upper limb and expectations on upper limb recovery; (3) Comfort, pain and quality of life (QoL); (4) Immobilization ; (5) Physiotherapy; (6) Occupational therapy; (7) Nursing (only for patients less than 6 months after stroke). The length to complete the survey was also organized to be achieved in 20 to 30 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis","Survey"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Therapists","description":"Physiotherapists/occupational therapists experienced in working with stroke patients.","interventionNames":["Other: Survey therapists"]},{"label":"Subacute stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients less than 6 months after their stroke suffering from upper limb paresis.","interventionNames":["Other: Survey patients"]},{"label":"Chronic stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients more than 6 months after their stroke suffering from upper limb paresis.","interventionNames":["Other: Survey patients"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Survey therapists","description":"A survey was conducted among therapists on upper limb treatment after stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Therapists"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Survey patients","description":"A survey was conducted among stroke survivors on upper limb treatment after stroke.","armGroupLabels":["Chronic stroke patients","Subacute stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"A questionnaire assessing the current practices of upper limb rehabilitation after stroke","description":"To identify the current daily practice in stroke rehabilitation concerning upper limb rehabilitation","timeFrame":"Dec 2016 - March 2017"},{"measure":"A questionnaire assessing the stroke survivors view on upper limb rehabilitation","description":"To identify the stroke survivors view on upper limb rehabilitation and understanding the patient needs for that matter.","timeFrame":"Dec 2016 - March 2017"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Stroke patients\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke with upper limb paresis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe language or cognitive problems which make it impossible to complete the survey\n\nTherapists\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* physiotherapists\n* occupational therapists\n* experienced in the treatment of stroke patients","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Physiotherapists and occupational therapists Stroke survivors with upper limb impairment","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Upper Extremity Paresis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
