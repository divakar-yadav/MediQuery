Remote assessment of patients and remote rehabilitation (tele-rehabilitation) has an increasing application area in individuals with chronic neurological diseases. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the upper extremity and balance functions of stroke patients with the developed software.","detailedDescription":"This prospective and descriptive study will be conducted with patients diagnosed with stroke. Patients diagnosed with stroke will first be evaluated by an expert physiatrist in a clinical setting to determine their functional status, and then evaluated by a virtual reality mediated software system. The evaluation of a patient will take approximately 1 hour.\n\nParticipants diagnosed with stroke will be evaluated in terms of hand and balance functions. The measurement parameters planned to be performed are scales routinely applied in stroke patients. Hand functions of the users will be evaluated with the 'Wooden Box and Block Test' , lower extremity muscle strength and fall risk will be evaluated with the 'Sit and Stand Test for 5 Times', and balance functions will be evaluated with the '360 Degree Rotation Test' . The tests mentioned above will be presented to the users first in the real world and then in the virtual reality environment and an objective functional status assessment will be made.\n\nA total of 50 patients diagnosed with stroke are planned to be included in the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["virtual reality","assessment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Participants diagnosed with stroke will be evaluated with the Box and Block Test, 360 degree rotation test and 5 times squat test.
