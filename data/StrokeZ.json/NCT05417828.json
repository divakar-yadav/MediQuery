The participant will be involved in a feasibility study (one-time visit) to prove the efficacy of the robotic device with different force feedback (assistive and resistive force) and other feedback such as VR (virtual reality). We will collect movement data from a motion capture system and sEMG sensors that measure muscle activity to monitor the effect of a robotic rehabilitation device, named Spherical Parallel Instrument for Daily Living Emulation (SPINDLE). We will use a robotic therapy device to practice activities during daily living. This pilot study will be used to understand the effect of SPINDLE to translate the device as a home-based training for chronic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Participant with Chronic stroke","description":"1.
