Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be used to enhance after-effects of rehabilitation through membrane polarization modulation. In this double-blind, crossover randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate whether single-session, bihemispheric tDCS to the primary motor cortex (M1) in combination with upper extremity rehabilitation therapy modulates ipsilesional motor circuit excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures.","detailedDescription":"We will consecutively enroll subacute (2-4 weeks after stroke onset) patients with first-time, unilateral, ischemic subcortical stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory with mild to moderate hand weakness. All subjects will be assessed for baseline upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer test and Action Research Arm test), structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A single session of bihemispheric tDCS (anodal tDCS to ipsilesional M1 and cathodal tDCS to contralesional M1 with 2 mA stimulation for 20 min) or sham tDCS (same but stimulation for only 2 min) with simultaneous physical/occupational therapy will be tested in each subject with a randomized sequence on different days (at least two days apart from each other). All stroke patients will receive standard medical and rehabilitation treatments during the study period. Changes in corticospinal excitability and transcallosal inhibition from the TMS study, as well as sensorimotor oscillations, MEG source projection, and functional connectivity from the task-related MEG will be assessed immediately before and after intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["neuroplasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"transcranial direct current stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation, anodal at ipsilesional M1 while cathodal at contralesional M1, for 20 minutes","interventionNames":["Device: Magstim Eldith DC-stimulator(Magstim Co., Whitland, UK)"]},{"label":"sham stimulation","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"same as the experimental stimulation condition but only for 2 minutes"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magstim Eldith DC-stimulator(Magstim Co., Whitland, UK)","description":"2 mA for 20 minutes transcranial direct current stimulation","armGroupLabels":["transcranial direct current stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)","timeFrame":"up to 20 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* subacute (2-4 weeks after stroke onset) patients\n* first-time, unilateral, ischemic subcortical stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory\n* mild to moderate hand weakness (MRC 2-4/5)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* cerebral cortex lesions\n* containing metal implants (such as implanted electrodes, pacemakers)\n* sensitive or fear of electromagnetic waves\n* pregnant women\n* history of alcohol or drug abuse\n* history of seizures or epilepsy EEG recording\n* other significant disease or neuropsychiatric disorders\n* claustrophobia\n* fixed dentures over two or more (enough to interfere with MEG signals)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"I-Hui Lee, M.D., Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+ 886-2-28712121","phoneExt":"8109","email":"ihlee@vghtpe.gov.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"I-Hui Lee, MD PhD","affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taipei","zip":"11217","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"I-Hui Lee, M.D., Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+ 886-2-28712121","phoneExt":"8109","email":"ihlee@vghtpe.gov.tw"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
