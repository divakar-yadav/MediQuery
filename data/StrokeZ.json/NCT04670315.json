The current situation caused by the Sars-cov-2 virus has collapsed health systems and has delayed these patient's treatment. The proposed alternative is telerehabilitation: a treatment system that has already proved its effectiveness. However, the difficulty to assess the stroke patient's functional status is the great problem. For this reason, a Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale adaptation, one of the most widely used (in research and in clinic), is proposed to be carried out remotely. The objective of our study is to validate this scale in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Validation Study","Patient Outcome Assessment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single Group","description":"Scale validation in stroke patients","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Telematic evaluation of motor function"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Telematic evaluation of motor function","description":"Validation of the Telematic Spanish Version of the Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale","armGroupLabels":["Single Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment of sensorimotor function","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment Lower Extremity (FMA-LE)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment of sensorimotor function (Short Form)","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being older than 18-years-old\n* Diagnosis of stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Another neurological or orthopedic problem different than stroke that will affect functionality and balance","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients older than 18 years with a diagnosis of stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Universidad de Salamanca","city":"Salamanca","zip":"37007","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":40.96882,"lon":-5.66388}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
