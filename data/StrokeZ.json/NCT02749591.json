Spasticity, a common impairment after stroke, has a profound impact on activity and participation for patients. BoNT-A injection combined with rehabilitation training is recommended to enhance functional recovery for stroke patients with spasticity. Although the positive combination effects of BoNT-A with stretch, RT, and constraint-induced movement therapy were reported, the quality of the evidence was weak due to methodology limitations. In addition, patients with spasticity usually have lower motor function and worse sensory deficits than patients without spasticity. Designing the post BoNT-A injection rehabilitation program should consider the above issues. RT and MT are two interventions providing sensorimotor input for patient with low level of motor function. It is unknown whether combining BoNT-A injection with RT or with MT have positive effects and engenders differential effects on motor and related functional performance.\n\nAt least 60 participants with chronic spastic hemiplegic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: BoNT-A injection with RT, BoNT-A injection with MT, and BoNT-A injection with control intervention (CI). All the post-injection interventions will be implemented 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 8 weeks. The RT group will receive 30-minute RT, followed by 30-minute functional training. The MT group will receive 30-minute MT, followed by 30-minute functional training. The CI group will receive 60-minute rehabilitation program, such as bilateral arm training and functional task practice. Body function and structures outcome measures include Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Modified Ashworth Scale, Medical Research Council scale, myometer (Myoton-3), actigraph, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Activity and participation measures include Wolf Motor Function Test, Ten meter walk test, Motor Activity Log, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. In addition, to directly reflect a patient's unique needs and goals, Goal Attainment Scaling will be assessed. Evaluators will be blind to group allocation. The outcome will be measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.\n\nThis comparative efficacy study will be the first to examine and compare the immediate and long-term combination effects of BoNT injection with RT, MT, or CI. The follow-up assessments will provide the long-term effects of different treatments on health-related outcomes, which are crucial for community reentry. In addition, the results of objective assessments and patient-reported outcomes may lead to individualized upper limb training following BoNT-A injection for patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke rehabilitation","spasticity","Botulinum toxin type A injection","robot-assisted therapy","mirror therapy","randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-assisted therapy (RT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After injection with Botulinum Toxin Type A, a schedule of robot-assisted therapy appointments will be established.
