With the growing understanding of cognitive recovery following stroke, rehabilitation specialists are optimistic that appropriate rehabilitation interventions may optimize and enhance functional outcomes. The use of technology based assessments via video games may assist in a patient's cognitive recovery. Design and development of an evidence-based game approach will enhance the investigators understanding and usability of electronic tools to measure cognitive and sensorimotor abilities. There is no intervention only an assessment for usability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Videogames; stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two treatment sessions during an inpatient rehabilitation stay.
