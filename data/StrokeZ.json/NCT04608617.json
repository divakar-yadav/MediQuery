The study results will be compared to a cohort from enrolling centers prior to Viz LVO implementation that will serve as a historical control. Data will be collected retrospectively from the time of presentation through 90 days post discharge.\n\nThe study will include patients undergoing imaging for a suspected LVO acute ischemic stroke. The post-Viz LVO intervention group will consist of patients who either presented to or underwent transfer to an interventional center, from a non-interventional center, following image analysis by Viz LVO. Data will be collected retrospectively on consecutive patients meeting eligibility criteria from the date of implementation up to 5 years post implementation.\n\nThe control group will consist of patients who either presented to or underwent transfer to an interventional center, from a non-interventional center, for evaluation prior to the implementation of Viz LVO. Data will be collected on consecutive patients from one day prior to implementation, back as far as 2 years prior to implementation"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Artificial Intelligence","Large Vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pre-Viz","description":"Pre-Viz LVO implementation patient data utilized as a control data set"},{"label":"Post-Viz","description":"Patient data collected post-Viz LVO implementation","interventionNames":["Device: Viz LVO (De Novo Number DEN170073)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Viz LVO (De Novo Number DEN170073)","description":"Viz LVO is a notification-only, parallel workflow tool for use by hospital networks and trained clinicians to identify and communicate images of specific patients to a specialist, independent of standard of care workflow.\n\nViz LVO uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze images for findings suggestive of a pre-specified clinical condition and to notify an appropriate medical specialist of these findings in parallel to standard of care image interpretation. Identification of suspected findings is not for diagnostic use beyond notification. Specifically, the device analyzes CT angiogram images of the brain acquired in the acute setting and sends notifications to a neurovascular specialist that a suspected large vessel occlusion has been identified and recommends review of those images. Images can be previewed through a mobile application.","armGroupLabels":["Post-Viz"],"otherNames":["ContaCT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Transfer patients: Time from spoke CT/CTA to door-out","description":"Time in minutes from CT/CTA imaging to time leaving the spoke center","timeFrame":"up to 1 day (1440 minutes)"},{"measure":"Non-transfer patients: Time from Hub door to groin puncture","description":"Time in minutes from arrival a hub center to start time of treatment","timeFrame":"up to 1 day (1440 minutes)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time from Spoke Door-In to Door-Out (DIDO)","description":"Time in minutes from arrival at spoke hospital to departure to hub hospital","timeFrame":"up to 1 day (1440 minutes)"},{"measure":"Time from Spoke CT/CTA to Specialist Notification","description":"Time in minutes from CT/CTA imaging to time an interventionalist was notified","timeFrame":"up to 1 day (1440 minutes)"},{"measure":"Time from Spoke CT/CTA to Groin Puncture","description":"Time in minutes from CT/CTA imaging to start time of treatment","timeFrame":"up to 1 day (1440 minutes)"},{"measure":"Time from Spoke Door to Groin Puncture","description":"Time in minutes from departure to hub hospital to start time of treatment","timeFrame":"up to 1 day (1440 minutes)"},{"measure":"Length of ICU Stay/Total Length of Stay","description":"Number of days in hospital in the ICU and the total number of days in hospital","timeFrame":"Hospital admit to discharge, up to 30 days"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at Discharge and 90 Days","description":"The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 to 5.
