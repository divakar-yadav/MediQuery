Disability following stroke results in significant impairment of patients quality of life. There was a lot of investigations with using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as effective additional therapy in stroke rehabilitation. In this researches uses different protocols and patient's categories: high-frequency, low-frequency, etc. Using method of navigation transcranial magnetic stimulation with neuroimaging could help in choosing optimal protocol, assess effectiveness of therapy and forming prognosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["navigation transcranial magnetic stimulation","stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low-frequency stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stimulation mode: 1 Hz, 100% MT, 20 minutes, unaffected hemisphere","interventionNames":["Procedure: Transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"High frequency stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stimulation mode: 10 Hz, 80% MT, 2 seconds - stimulation, 58 seconds - rest. - 8 session; affected hemisphere","interventionNames":["Procedure: Transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive standard treatment (kinesotherapy, physiotherapy) and simulate of transcranial magnetic stimulation.
