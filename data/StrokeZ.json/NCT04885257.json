Veterans enduring PTSD face difficulties in managing their PTSD severity after suffering from a stroke. Currently, clinical trials in PTSD exclude patients with stroke and patients with significant premorbid psychological conditions like PTSD are usually excluded from stroke clinical trials. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system stimulant that can improve PTSD symptoms: avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal, hyperarousal, and working memory. MPH can also improve post-stroke outcomes: mood, activities of daily living, and motor functioning. In clinical trials for PTSD or stroke, MPH has been shown to be well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. The high prevalence of PTSD in Veterans with stroke provides strong justification for development of interventions that effectively and simultaneously target both conditions. The overarching goal of our proposal is to understand how MPH improves PTSD severity in Veterans with comorbid stroke.","detailedDescription":"Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. Veterans enduring PTSD face difficulties in managing their PTSD severity after suffering from a stroke. Currently, clinical trials in PTSD exclude patients with stroke and patients with significant premorbid psychological conditions like PTSD are usually excluded from stroke clinical trials. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, selectively increasing prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. MPH can improve PTSD symptoms: avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal, hyperarousal, and working memory. The suspected mechanism is MPH activates PFC, enhancing fear extinction and improving PTSD symptoms. MPH can also improve post-stroke outcomes: mood, activities of daily living, and motor functioning. In clinical trials for PTSD or stroke, MPH has been shown to be well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. The high prevalence of PTSD in Veterans with stroke provides strong justification for development of interventions that effectively and simultaneously target both conditions. The overarching goal of our proposal is to understand how MPH improves PTSD severity in Veterans with comorbid stroke. The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the therapeutic effects on PTSD symptoms and post-stroke recovery of placebo-controlled MPH in Veterans diagnosed with PTSD and cerebral stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["PTSD","Stroke"],"keywords":["Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"double-blind placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate.
