Treatment of stroke caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (ischaemic stroke), with clotbusting drugs improves the chances of good recovery, but must be given within 4.5 hours of onset. Currently only a small proportion of patients who arrive in hospital within 4.5 hours are treated. This is largely due to uncertainty about diagnosis and concerns about risk of bleeding associated with clotbusting medication. Patients with mild or improving symptoms in particular are often not treated because of uncertainty about relative risks and benefits. However, around one third of these patients go on to be significantly disabled. Routine CT scanning often does not show abnormalities in acute stroke (which take hours to become easily visible), and cannot show the extent or severity of blood flow changes in ischemic stroke.\n\nWe wish to investigate the value of additional CT scanning that gives information on the blood vessels (angiography, CTA) and blood flow to the brain (perfusion, CTP) by undertaking a randomised trial. Extra scans are done in the same scanner and involve some extra radiation, injections of a contrast dye, and some extra time to acquire process and interpret. The extra scans may allow better treatment decisions for patients by increasing diagnostic certainty and by better assessment of stroke severity. However, we do not know whether the potential gains from better selection justify the resources and potential treatment delays that are involved. We will investigate whether the proportion of patients given clotbusting drugs differs between the two scanning protocols; and whether the outcomes differ, using standard measures of disability. We will also investigate whether use of different scanner manufacturers' software affect interpretation of scans."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischaemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control imaging (NCCT)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard imaging","interventionNames":["Other: control imaging"]},{"label":"additional multimodal imaging","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CT + CTA + CTP","interventionNames":["Other: additional multimodal imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"control imaging","armGroupLabels":["Control imaging (NCCT)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"additional multimodal imaging","armGroupLabels":["additional multimodal imaging"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients receiving Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (IV rtPA)","description":"Data will be collected at 4.5 hours from onset, comparison of proportion of patients receiving treatment will only be assessed at the end of the study","timeFrame":"4.5 hours from onset"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to treatment decision and administration","timeFrame":"4.5 hours from onset"},{"measure":"3 month modified Rankin Scale (mRS), by intention to treat, using a Cochran Mantel Haeszel distribution analysis","timeFrame":"90 days from onset"},{"measure":"Safety - symptomatic Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and major infarct swelling rates","timeFrame":"7 days from onset"},{"measure":"Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity","description":"Data will be collected at 4.5 hours from onset, comparison of proportion of patients receiving treatment will only be assessed at the end of the study","timeFrame":"4.5 hours from onset"},{"measure":"3 month mRS distribution in patients i) selected for IV rtPA and excluded from IV rtPA","timeFrame":"90 days from onset"},{"measure":"Comparisons of efficacy & safety outcomes in Target Population (imaged as per randomised allocation and per protocol)","description":"Data will for safety will be collected at day 7, data for efficacy will be collected at day 90.
