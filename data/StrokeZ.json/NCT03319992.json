The patients enrolled in the study are chronic stroke injured with right hemiparesis of moderate to severe degree, by the system injury pyramid, never undergoing rehabilitation treatment with robots."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)","Chronic Disease","Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Robotics [H01.671.293.643]","Exoskeleton Device [E07.341]","Rehabilitation Research [H01.770.644.145.472]","Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine [H02.403.680]","Exercise Therapy [E02.779.483]","Patient Outcome Assessment [N05.715.360.575.575.399]"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional treatment","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The conventional treatment arm was conducted according to a set of exercises that were specifically designed in order to match the robotic treatment.

The MA scale is a 6-point scale: scores range from 0 to 4, where lower scores represent normal muscle tone and higher scores represent spasticity or increased resistance to passive movement. MA scores were averaged across the two joints and across testing directions (flexion, extension) to estimate abnormal muscle tone in the upper extremity (Zackowski, Dromerick et al., 2004)","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 weeks"},{"measure":"Robotic kinesiological assessment of movement: Execution Time","description":"This measure is evaluated only in the group of patients performing robotic training, at the end of each session through the analysis of their performance during the execution of an evaluation exercise without robotic assistance.The patients are instructed to reach different targets positioned in front of them and placed around a vertical circumference at 12 equally spaced locations.\n\nThe robotic measure is extracted for each outgoing (from the center to the target) movement.
