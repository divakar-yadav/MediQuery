A number of retrospective studies have demonstrated that flow arrest during the clot retrieval process results in less clot fragmentation, lower rates of distal emboli, higher revascularization rates and improved rates of good neurological outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mechanical Thrombectomy","Stroke","Balloon Guide
