These local providers operate in the WRMC catchment area and transport over 90% of patients with a suspected stroke to WRMC comprehensive stroke center. Thus no changes to their standard operations would be implemented. The aim of this pilot study would be to test the accuracy of VAN-screening in the area in patients treated at WRMC - thus only patients who are brought to WRMC as per current protocol would be included in the study.\n\nThe investigators would train Central EMS and AirEvac personnel to perform the V.A.N screen, over a 2-month period (estimated June-July 2020) in several sessions at the Central EMS training center at 800 S. School Ave. in Fayetteville. This training would be performed by study investigators, assisted by medical students, residents, and advanced practice nurses (APNs). The training would consist of a training video, hands-on instruction, and sample scenarios.The investigators would survey all training participants to gather feedback on the format, delivery, and understanding of the training material. The PowerPoint presentation planned for the training session, as well as the post-training quiz, are attached as Appendices to this application. The investigators would expect a rate of 80% correct answers in the post-training quiz. All questions and scenarios would be discussed with all trainees after the quiz, and re-takes would be allowed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Van Positive","description":"Large Vessel Occlusion Positive","interventionNames":["Other: VAN Stroke Scale"]},{"label":"Van Negative","description":"Large Vessel Occlusion Negative","interventionNames":["Other: VAN Stroke Scale"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"VAN Stroke Scale","description":"V.A.N Stroke Assessment measures unilateral weakness with visual deficits, aphasia, and neglect in possible stroke patients","armGroupLabels":["Van Negative","Van Positive"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reliability of VAN Assessment Tool","description":"To investigate the reliability of VAN tool as administered by Emergency Medical Services personnel to predict presence of a large vessel occlusion in setting of cerebral ischemic infarction","timeFrame":"1 Year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Eligibility for Thrombolysis","description":"To investigate effect of the VAN tool to predict persons eligible for thrombolysis","timeFrame":"1 Year"},{"measure":"Eligibility for Thrombectomy","description":"To investigate effect of the VAN tool to predict persons eligible for thrombectomy","timeFrame":"1 Year"},{"measure":"Door to Intervention Time","description":"To investigate the effect of prehospital notification of VAN positive status vs routine notification on time door to needle or door to thrombectomy time","timeFrame":"1 Year"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Score","description":"To compare the discharge disposition and Rankin score of patients post intervention with VAN prenotification vs routine notification.
