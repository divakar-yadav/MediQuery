However, time of initial rehabilitation therapy is poorly defined and not underpinned by strong evidence in patients with stroke (modified Rankin Scale Score 3-4). The investigators do this parallel-group, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in shengjing hospital of China Medical University. Participants (aged≥18 years) with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, first or recurrent, who meet physiological criteria are randomly assigned (1:1), to receive usual stroke therapy. Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is allowed. Randomisation is stratified by study site and stroke severity. The primary outcome was a outcome 3 months after stroke, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3-4. The investigators do analysis on an intention-to-treat basis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Time of First Rehabilitation Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ERTAS-1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"first limb rehabilitation therapy took place within 48h for patients with acute stroke (modified Rankin Scale Score 3-4)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: stroke rehabilitation"]},{"label":"ERTAS-2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"first limb rehabilitation therapy took place after 48h for patients with acute stroke (modified Rankin Scale Score 3-4)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: stroke rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"stroke rehabilitation","description":"Physical rehabilitation exercise between 24 and 48 hours and after 48 hours","armGroupLabels":["ERTAS-1","ERTAS-2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome was a favourable outcome at 3 months after stroke, measured with the Fugl-Meyer motor function score.","description":"Fugl-Meyer score","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome was a favourable outcome at 3 months after stroke, measured with Modified Rankin Scale score.","description":"Modified Rankin Scale score","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
