CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc scores predict the likelihood of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Atrial flutter confers a similar risk of stroke as atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban is effective for prevention of thromboembolic stroke in most patients with AF. However, despite widely available risk stratification tools, five options for anticoagulation, and evidence-based practice guidelines, thromboprophylaxis for stroke prevention in AF is under-prescribed in the U.S., Europe, and worldwide. The investigators have previously demonstrated the efficacy of an alert-based computerized decision support (CDS) strategy for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in at-risk hospitalized patients not receiving any thromboprophylaxis.

The investigators' goal is to create and evaluate an alert-based CDS strategy for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators have the following specific aims:\n\nAim #1 (Primary Efficacy Endpoint)- To assess whether an alert-based computerized decision support strategy increases prescription of anticoagulation during hospitalization, at discharge, and at 90 days from enrollment.\n\nHypothesis #1- An alert-based computer decision support (CDS) strategy will increase prescription of prescription of anticoagulation during hospitalization, at discharge, and at 90 days from enrollment.\n\nAim #2 (Secondary Efficacy Endpoint)- To determine the potential impact of an alert-based computerized decision support strategy on the frequency of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events at 90 days, defined as cerebrovascular accident, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause mortality at 90 days from enrollment.\n\nHypothesis #2- This study will provide proof-of-concept data, including event rates, from which to design a larger randomized control trial to assess whether an alert-based CDS strategy will reduce the frequency of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events at 90 days, defined as cerebrovascular accident, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause mortality at 90 days from enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":458,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Alert Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"If the patient is randomized to the alert group, their ordering provider will receive a computer electronic alert notifying the responsible provider that his or her patient is high-risk for stroke due to AF or atrial flutter and that the patient is not ordered to receive anticoagulant therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Computer Electronic Alert"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"If the patient is randomized to the control group, the computer program will not issue an on-screen electronic alert."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Computer Electronic Alert","description":"A computer program that will issue an on-screen electronic alert notifying the responsible provider that his or her patient is high-risk for stroke due to AF or atrial flutter and that the patient is not ordered to receive anticoagulant therapy.
