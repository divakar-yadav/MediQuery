Deficits in dual-tasking may severely compromise the ability to participate fully in community living. Unfortunately, current rehabilitation practice for stroke fails to adequately address dual-task limitations; individuals with stroke continue to exhibit clinically significant dual-task costs on gait at discharge. As a result, many stroke survivors are living in the community with residual deficits that may increase disability in the real world and lead to falls with devastating consequences. To address this issue, the proposed study investigates the efficacy of dual-task gait training on attention allocation and locomotor performance in community-dwelling stroke survivors. Because walking in the real world often requires time-critical tasks and obstacle avoidance, the investigators will test the impact of dual-task gait training on cognitive-motor interference during walking at preferred speed and at maximal speed (Aim 1), and on locomotor control during obstacle negotiation (Aim 2). The investigators will also evaluate the effects of the intervention on community reintegration and participation (Aim 3)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait","Dual-task","Obstacle avoidance","Attention allocation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual-task gait training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Gait training with simultaneous performance of cognitive tasks for 75% of training session.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Gait training"]},{"label":"Single-task gait training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Gait training (without simultaneous cognitive task performance)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Gait training","description":"Twelve 30-minute sessions plus 10-minute stretching and warm up, provided 3 times per weeks for 4 weeks.
