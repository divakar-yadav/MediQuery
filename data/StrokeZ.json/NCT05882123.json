Both demographic and clinical data were collected from the study subjects. Different head magnetic resonance imaging sequences were used to assess the subjects' CMBs, white matter lesions, and old lacunar infarcts (LI). Various statistical methods, including the t-test, Ï‡2 test, and logistic regression, were used to analyze the gender heterogeneity of the influencing factors for CMBs in AIS patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Cerebral microbleeds","Influencing factors","Gender heterogeneity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":482,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Comparison of clinical data between AIS patients in CMB and non-CMB groups"},{"label":"without CMBs;
