We have recently conducted preclinical studies on the effects of ischemic preconditioning on the MSC functions. We have evaluated the characteristics of rat MSCs after culture with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum obtained from rat stroke model. Compared to FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Stroke","Mesenchymal stem cells","Stem cells","Neurogenesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mesenchymal stem cell treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Mesenchymal stem cell"]},{"label":"Standard treatment","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","description":"intravenous transplantation of autologous mesenchymal stem cells expanded with autologous serum","armGroupLabels":["Mesenchymal stem cell treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Categorical shift in modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"Categorical shift in mRS at 90 days after the cell treatment","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS)","description":"Change of NIHSS between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Early improvement of National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS)","description":"≥5 points improvement or score of 0-2 on NIHSS score at 14 days after treatment","timeFrame":"14 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Dichotomized modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"mRS ≤2 at 90 days after treatment","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"Change of mRS between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Dichotomized modified Barthel index (mBI)","description":"mBI ≥60 at 90 days after treatment","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of modified Barthel index (mBI)","description":"Change of mBI between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of gross motor function","description":"Change of Gross motor function (Motricity index and Fugl-Meyer assessment)between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of Fine motor function","description":"Change of Fine motor function (Purdue Pegboard test and Box and block test) between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of Mobility","description":"Change of Mobility (Functional ambulatory category and 10m-Gait speed) between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of mini-mental status exam (MMSE)","description":"Change of MMSE between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Change of quality of life","description":"Change of EuroQol 5d (EQ-5D) between pre- and post-treatment 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after the cell treatment"},{"measure":"Safety outcome","description":"1.
