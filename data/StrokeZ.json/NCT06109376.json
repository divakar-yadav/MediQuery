Hypothermia effectively reduces the metabolic level of brain tissue, may prolong the time window for recanalization therapy, and its multi-target therapeutic effect make it one of the most promising neuro-protection approach.\n\nIn recent years, hypothermia has been increasingly used to treat acute ischemic stroke. However, its role in acute ischemic stroke is unclear.\n\nThe objective of this trial is to investigate whether hypothermia combined with endovascular thrombectomy could add additional benefit without increasing the risk of adverse events such as pneumonia, intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic"],"keywords":["endovascular thrombectomy","hypothermia","large vessel occlusion","randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hypothermia","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in Hypothermia group received hypothermia combined with endovascular thrombectomy.","interventionNames":["Procedure: hypothermia","Procedure: thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in Control group received endovascular thrombectomy alone.","interventionNames":["Procedure: thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"hypothermia","description":"In this trial, intra-arterial select cooling infusion is used to reduce brain tissue temperature to 33-35°C.","armGroupLabels":["Hypothermia"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"thrombectomy","description":"Thrombectomy includes treatment with stent retrievers and/or thromboaspiration, balloon angioplasty, stenting, intra-arterial thrombolysis, or the various combinations of these approaches.","armGroupLabels":["Control","Hypothermia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale score (mRS)","description":"Modified Rankin scale score (mRS): scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no disability, 1 no clinically significant disability, 2 slight disability, 3 moderate disability but able to walk unassisted, 4 moderately severe disability, 5 severe disability, and 6 death","timeFrame":"90 days post-randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Excellent outcome","description":"Score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days post-randomization"},{"measure":"Functional independence","description":"Score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days post-randomization"},{"measure":"Moderate outcome","description":"Score of 0-3 on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days post-randomization"},{"measure":"Early neurological improvement","description":"Compared with baseline NIHSS, the 72h NIHSS score is reduced by 8 points or more, or the 72h NIHSS is 0\\~1 point","timeFrame":"72 hours post-randomization"},{"measure":"EQ-5D-5L scale score","description":"The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
