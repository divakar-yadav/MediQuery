However, it is difficult to provide appropriate feedback to the patient, because it's hard to see the throat muscle contraction and bone displacement,the real point of the force is not clear, only oral and tactile feedback is inadequate and when combined with sensory loss, fatigue or cognition impairment.\n\nBiofeedback is defined as \"the technique of using equipment (usually electronic) to reveal internal physiological events by visual and auditory signals, to teach patients to manipulate the intrinsic physiological activity (Basmajian, 1989).The rationale is thus that if a patient sees his muscle activity, rather than just feels his muscles contract, he will be able to contract his muscles more fiercely and therefore he will be able to train his muscles faster.\n\nPast studies have shown that biofeedback can help nerve injury patients control their physiological activities such as swallowing training.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether swallowing training combined with game-based biofeedback is effective in the treatment of dysphagia due to stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia"],"keywords":["stroke","swallowing training","game-based","biofeedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Game-based swallow biofeedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"swallowing training combined with game-based biofeedback in stroke dysphagia patient.","interventionNames":["Device: Game-based swallow biofeedback"]},{"label":"Swallow training without biofeedback","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Swallow training without biofeedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Game-based swallow biofeedback","description":"The intervention are divided into two parts：\n\n1.
