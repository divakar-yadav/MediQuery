Excessive administration of 0.9% normal saline has been to reported to cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, hypovolemia due to insufficient fluid replacement for perioperative loss can also result in metabolic acidosis by lactic acid accumulation. However, the guideline for perioperative fluid management has not been yet established. The investigators hypothesized that intraoperative fluid management according to SVV(Stroke Volume Variation)could reduce perioperative metabolic acidosis compared to those by CVP(Central Venous Pressure). Therefore, the study is trying to determine if intraoperative fluid administration based on SVV could reduce metabolic acidosis when compared with CVP in patients undergoing craniotomy due to brain tumor who receive 0.9% normal saline as main fluid regimen."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Tumor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group C","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"intraoperative fluid management based on CVP","interventionNames":["Drug: CVP"]},{"label":"group S","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"intraoperative fluid management based on SVV","interventionNames":["Drug: SVV"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"SVV","description":"During the surgery, patients in group S receive additional fluids (400 ml of normal saline or 200 ml of colloid) when SVV is less than 13.","armGroupLabels":["group S"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"CVP","description":"Patients in group C receive additional fluids (400 ml of normal saline or 200 ml of colloid) when CVP is less 8 during the surgery.","armGroupLabels":["group C"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Standard base excess point","timeFrame":"at the suturing of scalp"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients undergoing craniotomy due to brain tumor\n* American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II\n* aged from 20 to 65\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* compromised cardiopulmonary function\n* diabetes mellitus\n* symptom or sign with increased intracranial pressure\n* liver or renal disease\n* pre-existing metabolic acidosis\n* pregnant or breast-feeding\n* patients who cannot understand the statements for subjects","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Severance hospital","city":"Seoul","zip":"120-752","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001932","term":"Brain Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000016543","term":"Central Nervous System Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009423","term":"Nervous System Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4899","name":"Brain Neoplasms","asFound":"Brain Tumor","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3189","name":"Acidosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12057","name":"Nervous System Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18627","name":"Central Nervous System Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
