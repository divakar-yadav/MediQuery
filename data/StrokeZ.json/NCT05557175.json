Existing NOAB management is expensive, lacks standardized regimens, or is invasive. Therefore, evaluating the effectiveness of non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for NOAB management among stroke survivors remains crucial.\n\nObjectives: Evaluate the effects of active-rTMS compared to sham-rTMS among stroke survivors with NOAB, the interventions' cost-effectiveness and explore their experiences qualitatively.\n\nHypothesis: Active-rTMS will reduce NOAB symptom severity for stroke survivors, interventions' cost and assist in gaining insight into the NOAB patients' experiences.\n\nMethods: This study will be a randomised-sham-controlled, double-blinded trial, with embedded qualitative and cost-effectiveness studies. Snowball-convenience sampling technique and computer-generated randomisation will be adopted to recruit 30 participants into active-rTMS and sham-rTMS groups each. Active-rTMS participants will receive a continuous 1 pulse per second 1200 pulses of low-frequency rTMS to the pelvic floor muscle representation in the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) for 20 minutes thrice weekly. Sham-rTMS participants will receive the same parameters as the active-rTMS group, however, the coil will be rotated 90° away from the scalp. Fifteen active-rTMS participants will be invited for 45-60 minutes focus group discussions. The primary and secondary outcomes will be urinary incontinence severity and quality of life evaluated using the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score and Incontinence-Quality of life Questionnaire, respectively. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) will be the cost-effectiveness outcome. The EQ-5D-5L responses will estimate the gain or loss of QALY. A follow-up assessment will be conducted one-months post-intervention. The Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) will be used to collect information on the whole range of services and support required by the study participants.\n\nStatistical analysis: Normality will be evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk test. To determine active-rTMS and sham-rTMS group differences, between-groups analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted using R software. Bonferroni correction will be applied for multiple comparisons. Thematic analysis will be used for analysing the qualitative data. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the unadjusted mean costs and cost differences between active-rTMS and the sham-rTMS group will be calculated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Urgency Urinary Incontinence","Overactive Bladder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Active and Sham rTMS groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The therapist and the participants will be blinded in the recruitment, randomization and treatment allocation","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active rTMS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Sham rTMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"The active rTMS group will receive a 1 Hz inhibitory low-frequency rTMS protocol hotspot of the contra-lessional primary motor cortex (M1), will deliver a continuous pulse of 1 pulse per second totalling 1200 pulses of 80% active motor threshold stimulation.
