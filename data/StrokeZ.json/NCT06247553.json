The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nâ€¢ Will gait training improve the cardiovascular system in non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors better than a sitting leg cycling exercise?\n\nParticipants will walk on a treadmill with a partial body-weight support system and the gait training device. Researchers will compare with a leg-cycling exercise to see if there are significant differences in resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and A1c levels in the blood.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading cause of death and permanent disability. About 795,000 strokes occur in the US each year and more than seven million Americans are living with effects of stroke. Cardiovascular diseases are commonly presented and are primary causes of death in stroke survivors. Numerous studies have proven the benefits of walking or other forms of aerobic exercise for cardiovascular and pulmonary function in people after stroke. This proposed randomized controlled efficacy trial will primarily examine whether the investigators' gait training can improve the cardiovascular system in non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors better than a sitting leg cycling exercise. The investigators have recently developed a novel gait training device and a training program. The experimental group in the proposed project will undergo an 8-week gait training program using a treadmill with body-weight support and the investigators' novel gait training device. The control group will receive an 8-week sitting leg cycling exercise program with similar exercise intensity, frequency, and duration. The proposed project will examine differences between the two groups using a set of comprehensive outcome assessments of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and sensorimotor functions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Walking, Difficulty","Cardiovascular Injury"],"keywords":["stroke","unable to walk"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"single-blinding","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gait Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The gait training in the experimental group will use a treadmill with a partial body-weight support system and our gait training device.
