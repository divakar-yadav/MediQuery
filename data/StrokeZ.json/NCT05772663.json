With improved support treatment, the mortality rate decreases, but the sequelae, linked to the consequences of the stroke, remain numerous . More than 88% of stroke victims return at home upon discharge from hospital rehabilitation. However more and more people experience difficulties as a result of this return. Hospital discharge entails an imbalance between the period of hospitalization and place of residence in terms of the frequency and intensity of rehabilitation. In fact, the person benefits from rehabilitation during his hospitalization daily. After returning home, the person no longer benefits only 1 to 2 rehabilitation sessions per week, sometimes less . In view of these different elements, the investigators issue the assumption that making available to people AVC a self-rehabilitation program designed with and for them and centered on the meaningful occupations of the person will allow an increase in their occupational performance in their life activities daily. The aim of this study is to create a self-rehabilitation program based on people's daily living activities and designed with and for them and to evaluate the benefits of this program with a randomized controlled study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","self-rehabilitation program"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":158,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"personalized program group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"people with chronic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: Personalized program of rehabilitation"]},{"label":"routine rehabilitation care group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"people with chronic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: Routine program of rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Personalized program of rehabilitation","description":"D56: Follow-up visit (D56).
