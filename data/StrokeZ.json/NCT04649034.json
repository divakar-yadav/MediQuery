We have recently developed and patented a quantitative image-based method to map blood stasis within the cardiac chambers. The method is suitable for any medical imaging modality that provides time-resolved flow maps inside the heart (magnetic resonance, echocardiography, or computational-fluid-dynamic processing from anatomical CT images). The objective of the present project is to validate this certified technology in a multicentric cross-sectional clinical trial of 258 patients with different forms of cardiomyopathy with high-risk of stroke.\n\nWe will include patients with ischemic, non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in sinus rhythm and an echocardiogram, cardiac and cerebral MRI will be performed. Our objective is to quantify the ventricular stasis by post-processing of 2D color Doppler echocardiography and phase contrast-magnetic resonance images in order to establish the relationship between quantifiable intraventricular stasis variables and the prevalence of silent brain infarctions (SBIs) and intracavitary thrombosis determined by magnetic resonance (MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dilated Cardiomyopathy","Thrombosis Cardiac","Stroke","Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy"],"keywords":["Dilated cardiomyopathy","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","Cardiac thrombosis","Silent brain infarct","Stroke","Fluid dynamics","Intracardiac blood flow","Echocardiography","Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":258,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"86 patients ischemic DCM","description":"A cohort of 86 patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in sinus rhythm and ejection fraction (EF) of LV less than 45%","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Doppler echocardiogram exam","Diagnostic Test: Cardiac magnetic resonance","Diagnostic Test: Brain magnetic resonance","Diagnostic Test: Coagulation blood test","Diagnostic Test: Holter monitoring"]},{"label":"86 patients non ischemic DCM","description":"A cohort of 86 patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in sinus rhythm and ejection fraction (EF) of LV less than 45%","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Doppler echocardiogram exam","Diagnostic Test: Cardiac magnetic resonance","Diagnostic Test: Brain magnetic resonance","Diagnostic Test: Coagulation blood test","Diagnostic Test: Holter monitoring"]},{"label":"86 patients hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","description":"A cohort of 86 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in sinus rhythm and ejection fraction (EF) of LV less than 55% or with an apical aneurism diagnosed in an image test","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Doppler echocardiogram exam","Diagnostic Test: Cardiac magnetic resonance","Diagnostic Test: Brain magnetic resonance","Diagnostic Test: Coagulation blood test","Diagnostic Test: Holter monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Doppler echocardiogram exam","description":"A complete echocardiographic study will be performed at enrollment.
