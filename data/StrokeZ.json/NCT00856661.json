The only currently approved thrombolytic intervention for acute ischemic stroke, which constitutes the majority of strokes, is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rtPA). The use of alteplase is limited as it is approved for use within 3 hours after symptom onset and by the risk of inducing intracerebral haemorrhage; consequently fewer than 3% of acute stroke subjects are treated. The thrombolytic agent desmoteplase (recombinant Desmodus Salivary Plasminogen Activator alpha-1; rDSPAalpha-1) produced by recombinant biotechnology has its naturally occurring counterpart in the saliva of the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus. Compared to alteplase, desmoteplase has a more favourable profile in terms of high fibrin specificity and non neurotoxicity.\n\nThe study aims to confirm efficacy and safety of desmoteplase for thrombolytic therapy of patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the extended time window of 3 to 9 hours after onset of stroke symptoms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Angiography","Desmoteplase","Thrombolytic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":270,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Desmoteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Desmoteplase"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Desmoteplase","description":"90 Î¼g/kg bodyweight, IV, single bolus over 1 to 2 minutes on 1st day","armGroupLabels":["Desmoteplase"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"IV, single bolus over 1 to 2 minutes on 1st day","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS) (Percentage of Participants With mRS Scores 0-2)","description":"The mRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to provide a global assessment of the patients dependency after stroke.
