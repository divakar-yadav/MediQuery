The disease associates with 25 % of all stroke and 30 % of all dementia cases and imposes a major and increasing health burden worldwide. In this trial the investigator suggest a new promising solution to this problem.\n\nPatients with cerebral small vessel disease, who experience stroke or vascular dementia, may show reduced brain perfusion or altered neurovascular reactivity. The investigator has previously shown that a single dose of tadalafil (20 mg), shortly increased blood supply to the brain in patients with cerebral small vessel disease. This holds promise for new effective treatment targets. The investigator test if patients find three months daily intake of tadalafil (20 mg) feasible, and if it alters cerebral perfusion, neurovascular reactivity, and cognition, including memory and planning ability. The trial will help identify new treatment targets to reduce the number of patients with stroke, stroke sequelae, and vascular dementia.\n\nThis trial is divided into one main study and three sub studies:\n\n* Main study\n* Dynamical MRI sub study\n* Cognitive sub study\n* Biomarker sub study"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tadalafil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Oral tadalafil (20 mg) capsules once daily for three months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tadalafil 20 MG"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Oral placebo capsules once daily for three months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tadalafil 20 MG","description":"Daily dose of oral over-encapsulated tadalafil tablets (20 mg) for three months.","armGroupLabels":["Tadalafil"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Daily dose of oral over-encapsulated placebo tablets for three months.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of treatment defined as proportion of participants achieving full target dose of tadalafil/placebo.","description":"Number of participants achieving full target dose of tadalafil/placebo by end of three months trial period.
