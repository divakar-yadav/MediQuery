Intervention wil be applied and assesment will be done through fugl-meyer upper extremity scale, Modified Aashwarth scale,goniometry and action research arm test at zero, 3rd and 6th week.","detailedDescription":"Informed consent was taken and patients were assessed for eligibility and patients who meet the inclusion criteria were randomized through simple random sampling into experimental and control group. Zero, 3rd and 6th week assessment was done through Action research arm test to assess upper limb performance, Goniometry to assess range of motion, Fugl-meyer upper extremity scale FMUE to assess motor functioning, sensation and joint functioning and modified ashworth scale MAS to assess spasticity. Intervention was applied for 6 weeks. The intervention in control group (n=23) was conventional treatment which includes stretching (static stretching for 20 sec) and range of motion exercises (within limit of range) . Intervention was administered one set per day (12 reps per set) four repetitions for each movement direction for 3 days a week, over a course of 6 weeks.\n\nThe intervention in experimental group (n=23) was conventional treatment which includes stretching (static stretching for 20 sec) and range of motion exercises (within limit of range) with neurodynamics (Dynamic neural mobilization technique) which includes median, ulnar and radial nerve mobilization. Peripheral nerve was stretched for 20 sec with addition of dynamic movement which was performed after every 2 sec for a total of 20 sec. Neurodynamics was administered, one set per day (10 rep per set) , for 3 days a week, over a course of 6 weeks. Normality of data was checked through shapiro wilk test as sample size is \\<50 and parametric or non-parametric tests were applied accordingly through SPSS version 21.\n\nRhythmic neurodynamics accelerated the nerve conduction velocity more than the general neurodynamics. Positive effect of neurodynamics to reduce tone, increase range and improve function of stroke patients were determined in 2016. Combination of neural mobilization and Botulinum toxin-A is effective to reduce pain and increase ranges of motion.Decrease in anxiety also occurs. Botulinum toxin inhibits release of acetylcholine causing a blockade of the neuromuscular patches without affecting the antagonist muscles resulting in reduced spasticity.\n\nNeural mobilization is effective than conventional neural mobilization to increase β-waves and decrease μ-rhythms in C3 and C4 areas of cerebral cortex (primary motor areas). Neural mobilization was effective for improving range of motion of shoulder joint in all degree of freedom by reducing muscle tension and increasing extensibility of neural tissue. Neural mobilization is effective to reduce spasticity in bicep brachii muscle. Decrease in myoelectric activity is the mechanism behind reduction of tone in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Neurodynamics","Spasticity","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neurodynamics (Dynamic Neural Mobilization) with conventional treatment (stretching, AROM) will be applied.","interventionNames":["Other: Experimental group"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional treatment (stretching, AROM) will be applied","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Experimental group","description":"Neurodynamics with conventional treatment.

Action research arm test is highly reliable and valid 19 items tool (grasp (6 items), grip(4 items), pinch (6 items) and gross movement (3 items) which is used to asses upper extremity performance (coordination, dexterity and functioning). In ARAT scoring is done from 0 (unable to complete) to 3 (complete with normal movement). Scores on the ARAT range from 0-57 points, with a maximum score of 57 points indicating better performance. The ARAT can be used to predict the functional recovery of the upper extremity in stroke rehabilitation. Scores of less than 10 points, between 10-56 points, and 57 points correlate with poor, moderate, and good recovery respectively.","timeFrame":"6th week"},{"measure":"Range of motion of elbow joint ( flexion, extension, forearm Supination , Pronation)","description":"Changes from the baseline.
