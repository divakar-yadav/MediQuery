However, opportunities to prevent stroke due to AF are frequently missed because AF is paroxysmal and therefore not detected at the time of stroke. In addition, even when AF is identified anticoagulation may not be initiated due to perceived contraindications.\n\nThis study will (1) evaluate whether a gene marker can improve the identification of AF in patients with ischemic stroke, and (2) evaluate decisions by health care provider and patients to anticoagulate AF, and whether this decision could be improved by a marker of AF at time of stroke. An AF Gene Score will be developed comprised of genes associated with inflammatory and thrombotic pathways related to risk of AF thromboembolism in stroke patients with AF. The AF Gene Score measured at time of stroke can stroke will permits rapid identification of stroke due to AF which may increase initiation of anticoagulation therapy. This is important in cryptogenic stroke, where prolonged monitoring leaves uncertainty regarding the association of delayed AF with initial stroke and delays anticoagulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":131,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atrial fibrillation stroke"},{"label":"Non-atrial fibrillation Stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gene expression","timeFrame":"Post stroke through study completion, an average of 1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset\n* Complete evaluation to determine cause of stroke\n* Informed Consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active Infection\n* Lymphoma / Leukemia / Blood dyscrasia\n* Hemorrhagic stroke\n* Immunosuppressive therapy\n* Illicit drug use\n* Blood transfusion +/- 1 month\n* Major surgery/trauma in last 6mts","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of California Davis","city":"Sacramento","state":"California","zip":"95817","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.58157,"lon":-121.4944}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
