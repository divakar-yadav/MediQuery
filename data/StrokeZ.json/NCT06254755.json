Recent IAT modalities have been classified as suction aspiration,stent retrieval and combination modality. The suction aspiration technique is limited by the possibility of breaking the entire thrombus during the IAT. In addition, the stent retrieval technique is also limited because of thrombus migration during stent removal from an acute-angled artery as in the case of a carotid siphon.\n\nAccording to recent development of suction catheter, investigators expected that suction aspiration will prevent breaking the entire thrombus during the IAT. Investigators will evaluate the radiological and clinical outcome of suction aspiration technique in comparison with combination technique in the large artery occlusion feasible to both suction aspiration and combination technique prospectively in a randomized trial.","detailedDescription":"\\*Hospital code for the participant hospitals Bundang Cha Hospital (A) Inje University Haeundae Paik Hospital(I) Samsung Medical Center Sungkyunkwan University (B) Kosin University Gospel Hospital (C) Daegu Good morning Hospital (D) Yeungnam University Medical Center (E) Pohang S hospital(G) Inje University Ilsan Paik Hospital(H) SM christianity Pohang Hospital(L) Choongnam National University Hospital(N) Inha University Hospital(P) Catholic University of Korea Bucheon ST.
