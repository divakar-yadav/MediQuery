Stimulation characteristics to be tested are frequency of vibration, pressure between the device and the skin, mode of vibration (pulsed or continuous).","detailedDescription":"Participants were recruited who had chronic moderate to severe dysphagia following stroke or radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Their frequency of swallowing was transduced with an accelerometer placed on the skin over the thyroid cartilage and inductive plethysmography bands placed over the rib cage and abdomen. When laryngeal elevation coincided with respiratory apnea a swallow was marked. Five different motor frequencies were evaluated to determine their effect on participants frequency of swallowing (swallows per minute). Frequencies were 30, 70, 110, and 150 Hz and a combination of 70 and 110 Hz. For each vibratory frequency the number of swallows per minute occurring during stimulation was compared with sham when the participant was wearing the device but the motor was not turned on. The frequency fo swallowing during stimulation was compared with the frequency of swallowing between stimulations. Visual analogue ratings of the urge to swallow and discomfort were also measured after each condition. Other parameters were the pressure between the motor and the skin (0, 2, 4, and 6 kPa) and swallow initiation time when stimulation was on and when it was not. Swallowing frequency with continuous versus pulsed stimulation was also compared."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oropharyngeal Dysphagia"],"keywords":["Swallowing","Stroke","Sensory stimulation","Home based therapy","Head and Neck Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vibrotactile Stimulation in Dysphagia","description":"A Vibrotactile stimulation device will be evaluated in patients with chronic moderate to severe dysphagia for more than 6 months post onset due to stroke or following radiation treatment for head and neck cancer to assess which frequency, mode, pressure characteristics are most helpful in increasing the rate of swallowing, increasing the urge to swallow, assisting with the initiation of swallowing and not affecting discomfort.","interventionNames":["Device: Vibrotactile stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Vibrotactile stimulation","description":"Comparison of the effects of different vibratory characteristics on the frequency of swallowing, time of initiation of swallowing with stimulation and urge to swallow.
