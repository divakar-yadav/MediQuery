To investigate the feasibility of using IMUs (Xsens, MVN Studio) during functional tasks to assess upper limb kinematics in pwMS and stroke survivors. On the one hand, the feasibility of performing the tasks will be investigated . On the other hand, does the XSens give valuable data?\n2. To investigate the discriminative validity of kinematic measurements of upper limb movements post-stroke and pwMS in comparison with gender and age-matched healthy controls\n3. To investigate the test-retest reliability of the kinematic parameters collected during the different functional tasks in pwMS and stroke survivors\n\nIt is a cross-sectional case-controlled observational study, with 3 different groups: 25 Persons with Multiple sclerosis, 25 stroke patients and 50 healthy controls, matched by age and gender."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis","CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)","type":"OTHER","description":"25 persons with MS Persons perform funtional-oriented upper limb movments while wearing IMUs (Xsens, MVN Studio).
