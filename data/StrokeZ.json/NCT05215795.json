Box and Block Test, Modified Box and Block Test, Targeted Box and Block Test, 9 Hole Peg Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity will used to assess upper extremity. To evaluate validity between Modified and Targeted Box and Block Tests and Box and Block Test, 9 Hole Peg Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment will used to correlation analysis tests. The investigator will evaluate after one week to test-retest reliability to patients. Other pyhsiotherapist will evaluate to patients inter-rater reliability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Validity","Reliability","Modified Box and Block Test","Targeted Box and Block Test","Upper Extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Box and Block Test","description":"The Modified Box and Block (mBBT) test is an upper extremity performance test.Unlike BBT, in mBBT, instead of randomly picking the cubes, 16 cubes are arranged in a certain order.\n\nThe cubes are asked to take the other cubes in that row, starting from the innermost left cube, first to the right, and then to the next upper row.\n\nIt is recorded how many seconds passed through 16 cubes placed at a certain level.","timeFrame":"10 minute"},{"measure":"Targeted Box and Block Test","description":"In tBBT, as in mBBT, the time of passing 16 cubes over the obstacle to the other side is recorded. However, the difference from mKBT is that 16 cubes are placed at a certain level, but the patients are asked to place the cubes on the other side in 4 cm squares where the cube will be placed.\n\nThese squares correspond to the left symmetrical position of the cube on the right.\n\nIn this way, patients have to place the cube they grasp only at the desired point.","timeFrame":"10 minute"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"9 Hole Peg Test","description":"9HPT is a dexterity test.The patient is asked to place the 9 wooden blocks into the 9 holes in the maximum amount of time.Then he is asked to take it out and put it back in its place.
