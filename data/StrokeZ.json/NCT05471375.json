This database will serve as a resource for clinicians and researchers interested in the investigation of movement or rehabilitation-related research ideas.","detailedDescription":"Scholarly research in the field of physical rehabilitation helps to aid in maximizing outcomes for individuals that require these services due to orthopedic and neurologic injuries. To produce quality research results, large cohorts of individuals are often required for data analysis. Some research facilities or labs do not have adequate access to large cohorts or may not have the means to recruit them. By building the C-STAR database, the intent is to create a database that can serve as a hub for data sets that researchers and clinicians with appropriate access may use to support their research questions related to movement and physical rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Parkinson Disease","Lower Limb Amputation Above Knee (Injury)","Lower Limb Amputation Below Knee (Injury)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"7 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"For this cohort, individuals who have experienced a stroke will be asked to complete a variety of movement related rehabilitation assessments with wearable sensors and audio/video recording.","interventionNames":["Other: Database Entry"]},{"label":"Parkinsons Disease","description":"For this cohort, individuals who have been diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease will be asked to complete a variety of movement related rehabilitation assessments with wearable sensors and audio/video recording.","interventionNames":["Other: Database Entry"]},{"label":"Lower Limb Amputation","description":"For this cohort, individuals who have experienced a lower limb amputation will be asked to complete a variety of movement related rehabilitation assessments with wearable sensors and audio/video recording.","interventionNames":["Other: Database Entry"]},{"label":"Healthy Control","description":"For this cohort, individuals who have no significant neurologic or orthopedic injuries will be asked to complete a variety of movement related rehabilitation assessments with wearable sensors and audio/video recording.","interventionNames":["Other: Database Entry"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Database Entry","description":"Database entries will contain wearable sensor, audio, and video data collected during rehabilitation-related movement assessments","armGroupLabels":["Healthy Control","Lower Limb Amputation","Parkinsons Disease","Stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Database development","description":"To develop an online database that contains movement and rehabilitation-related data collected with wearable sensors and video that may be accessed, with appropriate permissions, by clinicians and researchers that are interested in the investigation of movement or rehabilitation related research ideas.","timeFrame":"Data will be collected and added to the C-STAR database for 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
