Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase is the mainstay medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. given intravenously within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, to reopen occluded intracerebral arteries. As in fact most patients with ischemic stroke present to the emergency department beyond the approved time window for thrombolytic or other revascularization therapies beside their high cost and at this time, there are no approved urgent therapies for most of these patients In addition, those who present with rapidly resolving deficit or low National Institutes of Health stroke scale score are generally not considered for thrombolytic treatment, although approximately one third of them may be at high risk for neurological deterioration and recurrent vascular events.This study will evaluates the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin in treatment of patients not eligible for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or any other acute reperfusion therapy with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack within 24 hours of symptoms onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"use of aspirin and clopidogrel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"evaluates the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin as an alternative treatment in patients not eligible for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or any other acute reperfusion therapy with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 24 hours of symptoms onset","armGroupLabels":["use of aspirin and clopidogrel"],"otherNames":["clopidogrel"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"A clinically significant neurologic deterioration","description":"NIHSS score to detect the outcome of the patients as a greater than or equal to 2-point decrease or a score of 0.","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
