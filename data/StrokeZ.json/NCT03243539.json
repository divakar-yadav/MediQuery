It is proven that using lower ventilator volume settings improves outcomes. In patients with acute brain injury, it is proven that maintaining a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood improves outcomes. Mechanical ventilator settings with higher volumes and higher breathing rates are sometimes required to maintain a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide. These 2 goals of mechanical ventilation, using lower volumes to prevent additional lung injury but maintaining a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, are both important for patients with acute brain injury. The investigators have designed a computerized ventilator protocol in iCentra that matches the current standard of care for mechanical ventilation of patients with acute brain injury by targeting a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide with the lowest ventilator volume required.\n\nThis is a quality improvement study with the purpose of observing and measuring the effects of implementation of a standard of care mechanical ventilation protocol for patients with acute brain injury in the iCentra electronic medical record system at Intermountain Medical Center. We hypothesize that implementation of a standardized neuro lung protective ventilation protocol will be feasible, will achieve a target normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, will decrease tidal volumes toward the target 6 mL/kg predicted body weight, and will improve outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Brain Injury","Traumatic Brain Injury","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke","Cerebral Edema","Anoxic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["lung protective ventilation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":728,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lung Protective Ventilation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects with acute brain injury (traumatic brain injury and non-traumatic brain injury) will receive neuro lung protective ventilation which targets a normal arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide with the lowest tidal volume possible (6 to 8 ml/kg predicted body weight).
