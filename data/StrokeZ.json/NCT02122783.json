The study brace is an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) that makes use of a newer type of joint that contains a soft insert, in addition to the conventional hard stops, to limit the range of motion of the ankle during walking. The results of this study will help to clarify 1) whether and how this new joint affects the way you walk, 2) whether it makes it easier for the clinician to align your brace and 3) your opinions about the new joint.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate how two different settings of a commercially available ankle foot brace affect how stroke patients walk.
