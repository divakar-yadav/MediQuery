Healthy temporal adaptation can increase and support engagement in meaningful activities. This study aims to analyze the effect of the temporal adaptation approach on the post-discharge occupational engagement of individuals with stroke.\n\nMethods: This study is a randomized controlled trial with 1 month follow-up. While the TAA approach was applied to the first group, the general condition of the second group was followed during the study. Canadian Occupational Performance Measue was administered to assess occupational performance and satisfaction, and Occupational Balance Questionnaire was for occupational balance.\n\nKewords: Time, stroke, rehabilitation, human activities, participation"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation, human activities, participation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Used Temporal Adaptation Approach","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Temporal Adaptation Approach"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Follow up via telephone calls"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Temporal Adaptation Approach","description":"the temporal adaptation: It includes giving importance to the use of time, choosing meaningful activities, adjusting the time used during these activities and improving it.
