Investigators will perform a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial with 24 subjects; 12 will receive sham stimulation and 12 will receive real stimulation. After a baseline assessment, the tDCS device will be applied for 20 minutes, once daily over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), for a total of two weeks. Follow-up assessments with outcome metrics will be completed after the seventh and fourteenth sessions, and one-month following the start date (2 weeks post-treatment). In a randomly selected subset of both real and sham participants, rs-fMRI will be completed at baseline and post-treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fatigue","Stroke Rehabilitaion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real tDCS stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects randomized to receive real/active electrical stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: Real Soterix Mini-CT tDCS stimulator"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects randomized to receive sham/non-activating electrical stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Soterix Mini-CT tDCS stimulator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Real Soterix Mini-CT tDCS stimulator","description":"Real transcranial electrical stimulation at 2mA intensity will be delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 20 minutes/day, 14-day duration.","armGroupLabels":["Real tDCS stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham Soterix Mini-CT tDCS stimulator","description":"Sham stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 20 minutes/day, 14-day duration.
