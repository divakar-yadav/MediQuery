Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is commonly diagnosed after the onset of HF once patients become symptomatic. The investigators intend to study whether early MD can be detected by identifying certain levels of plasma catecholamines and whether the level correlates with severity of myocardial depression. Identification of early MD changes can lead to alteration of management strategies and may help prevent worsening of HF. Highly selected patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) or Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) requiring induced hypertension with the use of norepinephrine infusion will be recruited to enroll in this pilot study. This group of patients are expected to have high circulating catecholamines and are more likely to develop MD. Given the prevalence of TTS in females and elderly, 10 female patients \\>50 years admitted to the neuro ICU with diagnosis of either AIS or SAH will be enrolled. Patients with history of coronary artery disease, smoking, poorly controlled diabetes with HbA1c \\>8 and uncontrolled hypertension will be excluded. Patients with poor ECHO windows will also be excluded. Baseline plasma catecholamine levels, transthoracic ECHO(TTE), Troponin T, EKG and BNP will be obtained and will be followed daily through the study duration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Depression","Takotsubo Syndrome","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Baseline plasma catecholamine levels, transthoracic ECHO(TTE), Troponin T, EKG and BNP will be obtained.
