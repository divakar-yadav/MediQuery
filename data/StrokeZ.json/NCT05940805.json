The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive treatment protocol with four therapeutic modalities in the recovery of patients with chronic stroke by evaluating clinical, neurological and functional outcomes.\n\nMethodology: Thirty-two subjects diagnosed with a stroke at least six months prior to the study were randomized to receive ten sessions of either the treatment protocol or a sham intervention. The treatment protocol consisted of transcranial low-frequency electrical stimulation using subcutaneous needles over the scalp, paraspinous blocks, spastic muscle needling and functional electrical stimulation. Spasticity, range of motion, pain, functionality and quality of life were evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Upper Limb Spasticity"],"keywords":["Muscle Spasticity","Stroke","Stroke Rehabilitation","Nerve Block","Dry Needling","Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Electric Stimulation Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Thirty-two subjects diagnosed with a stroke at least six months prior to the study were randomized to receive ten sessions of either the treatment protocol or a sham intervention.
