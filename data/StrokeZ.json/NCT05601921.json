Underlying mechanisms of shoulder pain after stroke still completely is not clarified. Central sensitization and neuropathic pain mechanisms are thought to play a role in the etiology of pain. Research on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy in the treatment of pain in which somatosensory sensitization mechanisms play a role is increasing day by day. There are studies showing that application of high-frequency rTMS to the primary motor cortex provides effective pain relieving in most of painful conditions. However, data in the literature regarding the application of high-frequency rTMS in shoulder pain after stroke are very limited. There is only one clinical study related to this. More studies are needed in this area.In our study, it was aimed to examine the effects of this treatment protocol applied on the effects of pain on daily activities, upper extremity disability, anxiety, depression, range of motion and neurophysiological parameters.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the most common causes of disability and death in the adult population. Many complications such as depression, shoulder pain, falls, urinary system infections can develop after stroke. These complications prevent stroke rehabilitation and delay functional recovery. Hemiplegic shoulder pain is also one of the most common complications after stroke. Many possible causes underlying its development have been described; It may develop due to many pathologies such as rotator cuff lesions, biceps tendinopathy, soft tissue disorders such as myofascial pain, glenohumeral subluxation, spasticity, changes in peripheral and central nervous system activity. Many options such as joint range of motion (ROM) exercises, electrical stimulation, analgesics, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, botulinum toxin-A injections are used in the management of pain. However, current treatment options provide limited pain relief, which causes chronic pain in many patients. This suggests that post-stroke shoulder pain is not only due to simple nociceptive stimuli from the shoulder joint, but also includes nociceptive and neuropathic mechanisms related to both the peripheral and central nervous systems. In recent years, TMS studies have been conducted in many painful conditions, which are thought to have complex pain mechanisms in the pathogenesis, and its effectiveness has been reported.In our study, it was aimed to examine the effects of this treatment protocol applied on the effects of pain on daily activities, upper extremity disability, anxiety, depression, range of motion and neurophysiological parameters."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["Stroke","Shoulder pain","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active stimulation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in the real stimulation group will receive rTMS treatment to the motor cortex (M1) of the affected hemisphere at a frequency of 5 Hz, once a day for 3 weeks and a total of 15 sessions.
