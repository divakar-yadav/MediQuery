However, the two methods are restricted by a strict time window, which greatly limits the number of the patients receiving treatment. The abundant studies have suggested that good collateral circulation can provide compensatory blood supply to save the ischemic penumbra and reduces the infarct volume, which improves the prognosis. How to improve collateral circulation in an efficient and safe way is a clinical challenge. Our recent experiment results of the animal and clinical experiments show that head-down position can significantly increase cerebral perfusion and improve neurological function. Clinically, head-down position is simple and easy to operate, and theoretically may increases brain perfusion and improve collateral circulation. A pilot randomized clinical trial is designed to investigate the effect of head-down position combined with routine rehabilitation in patients with ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["head-down position","ischemic stroke","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Head down position","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"head-down position treatment combined with conventional rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Other: head-down position treatment","Other: Conventional Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional rehabilitation treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"head-down position treatment","description":"In the head-down position, the body is in the supine position with the head lowered to 30 degrees","armGroupLabels":["Head down position"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Rehabilitation","description":"The body is in the supine position without lowered head","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Rehabilitation","Head down position"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0 to 2","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"proportion of patients with modified Rankin Score 0 to 1","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The percentage of reduction in Fugl-Meyer score","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"occurrence of stroke","description":"stroke or TIA","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The percentage of reduction in MMSE","description":"MMSE，Mini-mental State Examination","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The percentage of reduction in MoCA","description":"MoCA, Montreal Congnitive Assessment","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of major vascular events","description":"ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, vascular death","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"the biggest tolerance time of head-down","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. age ≥18 years\n2. acute ischemic stroke within 10 - 30 days of onset\n3. neurological deficit: 6≤NIHSS≤16\n4.
