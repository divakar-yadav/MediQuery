Approximately 17,000 prospective cohort of patients will be enrolled. Consecutive patients who meet the eligibility criteria and provide informed consent. Patients enrolled in the registry will be followed for approximately 3 years. Patient follow-up by National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases will continue as scheduled. Atrial Fibrillation Data capture will include demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, diagnosis, type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent AF), treatment strategy (rate vs. rhythm), antithrombotic therapy, concomitant medications and doses, laboratory tests, echo and computed tomography results, blood sample, insurance and provider information, comorbidities, and outcomes. The primary outcome will be stroke or non-CNS embolism. Other pre-defined outcomes of interest will include major adverse cardiac events, all-cause mortality, cause-specific death (sudden, non-sudden, heart failure-related), major bleeding, and hospitalization for heart failure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Atrial fibrillation","Risk factors","Registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Plasma sample"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite of Stroke and Systemic Embolic Events (SEE)","description":"The composite of stroke and Systemic Embolic Events (SEE) during follow-up.
