This study will recruit 10,000 consecutive eligible patients with acute stroke from more than 50 hospitals. 24 months follow-up will be carried out on-site in hospitals and by telephone to track endpoint (including all-cause mortality, composite cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events at one and two year follow up, and neurological and functional assessments)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Transient Ischemic Attack","Cerebral Hemorrhage","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"24 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SECRETS-TCM","description":"Stroke patients who treated by western medicine and/or traditional Chinese medicine in southern China","interventionNames":["Other: observational only-no intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"observational only-no intervention","description":"Observational only and no predesigned interventions in this study.","armGroupLabels":["SECRETS-TCM"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"All-cause mortality","timeFrame":"12 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Composite cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events","description":"Including stroke recurrence events,acute myocardial infarction and cardiac death","timeFrame":"12 months follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"All-cause mortality","timeFrame":"24 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Composite cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events","description":"Including stroke recurrence events,acute myocardial infarction and cardiac death","timeFrame":"24 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale(mRS)","description":"Range:Grade 0 to Grade 6, higher grade represent a worse outcome","timeFrame":"3 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Barthel Index(BI)","description":"Range:0 to 100 points, higher points represent a better outcome","timeFrame":"3 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE)","description":"Range:0 to 30 points, higher points represent a better outcome","timeFrame":"3 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale(mRS)","description":"Range:Grade 0 to Grade 6, higher grade represent a worse outcome","timeFrame":"12 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Barthel Index(BI)","description":"Range:0 to 100 points, higher points represent a better outcome","timeFrame":"12 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE)","description":"Range:0 to 30 points, higher points represent a better outcome","timeFrame":"12 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale(mRS)","description":"Range:Grade 0 to Grade 6, higher grade represent a worse outcome","timeFrame":"24 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Barthel Index(BI)","description":"Range:0 to 100 points, higher points represent a better outcome","timeFrame":"24 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE)","description":"Range:0 to 30 points, higher points represent a better outcome","timeFrame":"24 months follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. â‰¥18 years.\n2.
