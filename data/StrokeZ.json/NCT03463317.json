The risk of stroke can be reduced by approximately 65%. However, long-term anticoagulation therapy also increases the risk of major bleeding.\n\nA significant proportion of patients at high risk of stroke do not tolerate long-term anticoagulation due to various relative or absolute contraindications. As demonstrated in previous studies with non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (NOAK), 20-25% of patients were unable to tolerate long-term anticoagulation therapy.\n\nFor this reason, additional therapeutic approaches for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation have been developed.\n\nA promising approach is catheter-based closure of the left atrial appendage, because more than 90% of cardiac thrombi in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation are detected in the left atrial appendage. Recent registry studies show that the safety of LAA occluder implantation is promising. However, further scientific studies are required, in order to explore more benefits of the underlying method and eligible patients for implantation.\n\nStudy objectives:\n\nThe study goal is to determine the clinical benefit of percutaneous catheter-based left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) at high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc Score ≥2) as well as high risk of bleeding as compared to best medical care (including a \\[non-vitamin K\\] oral anticoagulant \\[(N)OAC\\] when eligible)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Anticoagulation","Left atrial appendage closure","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Event-driven group-sequential design, non-inferiority test, if significant followed by superiority test","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1512,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LAA closure group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Left atrial appendage closure by use of CE-mark approved LAA closure devices followed by post procedure treatment (antiplatelet therapy e.g. acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel)","interventionNames":["Device: CE-mark approved LAA closure devices","Drug: Acetylsalicylic acid","Drug: Clopidogrel"]},{"label":"Best medical care group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"No left atrial appendage closure.
