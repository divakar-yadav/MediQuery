Treatment period: patients are divided into exposure group and non-exposed group based on the use of edaravone dextrol after ischemic stroke. The exposure group: edaravone dextrol is used according to reference to clinical practice, without specific restrictions. The non-exposed group: edaravone dextrol is not used, and concomitant therapy is at the clinician's discretion. Follow-up period: All patients continue to be followed up to 90 days after stroke onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","edaravone
