Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have demonstrated benefit in vascular dementia, but efficacy in treating more circumscribed cognitive deficits following stroke, such as aphasia, has not been systematically investigated.\n\nThis study evaluated the efficacy of Galantamine (Reminyl) in subjects with chronic, stable non-fluent aphasia secondary to stroke. Subjects enrolled in a double-blind placebo- controlled cross-over study that employed a comprehensive battery of language tests and measures of general cognitive and behavioral status that will be used to control for factors that may influence language functioning. The primary study outcome was a within-subject comparison of changes in language function and behavioral scores between placebo and active-treatment phases (12 weeks each). Our hypothesis was that by increasing acetylcholine levels, and facilitating activity of other neurotransmitters affecting attentional systems, Galantamine would produce gains in both language and behavioral scores in patients suffering chronic effects in cognitive systems due to injury following stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Aphasia","treatment","cholinesterase inhibitor","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Galantamine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Galantamine"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo pill"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Galantamine","description":"Galantamine XL 8 mg for 4 weeks, followed by Galantamine XL 16 mg for subsequent 12 weeks.
