Severe disorders need to be treated as soon as possible and they need to be rehabilitated quickly in order for motor functions to develop properly. In the acute / subacute phase, patients are given robotic treatment. In addition to the study of mtoros functions, the study of gait and codination is the primary result. Patients treated with soft exoskeleton receive 15 treatments and movement testing is performed continuously. Members of the control group receive standard rehabilitation therapy. After 3 weeks, both groups will participate in a control study and then in a repeat control study at week 6. Our main goal is to compare the results and determine the efficiency of the robotic device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["balance","soft exoskeleton","walk","robotic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Neurorehabilitation"]},{"label":"Controll","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neurorehabilitation","description":"Neurorehabilitation with soft exsoskeleton robotic 3-week-long","armGroupLabels":["Robotic"],"otherNames":["Rob group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Physiotherapy","description":"Physiotherapy 3-week-long","armGroupLabels":["Controll"],"otherNames":["Controll groum"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Qualiti of life measured by Barthel index","description":"quetionnaire","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"gait/functional test","description":"6 minute walk test (m)","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"gait/functional test","description":"10 m walk test (m/s)","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"balance test","description":"Berg balance test","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"postural control test","description":"posturography","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\npost stroke 6MWT : 120\\> minimum after stroke 3 days\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSever heart problem sever demeanor alcoholism drug problems","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"55 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Dr. Tollár József","city":"Kaposvár","state":"Somogy","zip":"7400","country":"Hungary","geoPoint":{"lat":46.36667,"lon":17.8}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Related Info","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=robotic+rehabilitation%2C+soft+exoskeleton"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
