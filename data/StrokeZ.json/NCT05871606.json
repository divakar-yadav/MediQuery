This therapy will help to increase collateral circulation and perfusion to the penumbra, salvaging this tissue and limiting the volume of core infarct while mitigating reperfusion injury to the salvaged tissue.\n\nProtection of ischemic penumbra is paramount in IAMT stroke patients. IAMT to re-establish blood flow during AIS from a large vessel occlusion (LVO) reduces death and disability. Initially this intervention was recommended up until 6 hours after symptom onset, but more recently has proven safe and effective up to 16 and 24 hours after stroke onset in select patients. These studies have confirmed the long believed thought that supporting ischemic penumbra during AIS helps limit the size of the ultimate core infarct and therefore reduces disability and death from stroke. Treatment aimed at protecting ischemic penumbra is thus paramount to treatment and research endeavors in AIS patients.\n\niNO protects ischemic penumbra. Nitric oxide is an endothelial-derived vasodilator and has been shown to mediate cytoprotection after ischemic reperfusion injury and appears to aid in ischemic preconditioning signaling pathways. iNO has been shown to cause selective dilation of arterioles in the ischemic penumbra of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage animal models, helping augment the cerebral microcirculation and improve penumbral blood flow. This has been shown to reduce ischemic brain damage, limit core infarct, and consistently improve neurological outcome in a middle cerebral artery AIS mouse model"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Acute Cerebrovascular Disease"],"keywords":["Stroke","blood clot extraction","large vessel occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"The study has been designed to follow a standard 3+3 cohort expansion design, assessing 5 doses. Specifically, 3 individuals will begin at dose 1. If none of these individuals experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then the dose will be escalated to dose 2. DLT is defined as a patient experiencing sICH, our primary outcome measure, or any other listed ASE. Dose escalation will continue after each set of 3 individuals until at least one person experiences DLT. If only 1 of the 3 experience a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 (an additional 3). If 2 of the 6 experience DLTs, then dose escalation is stopped and the previous dose level (one level below) is declared the maximum tolerated dose. If 2 of the initial 3 experience DLT, the previous dose level (one level below) is declared the maximum tolerated dose. However, if only 1 of 6 experience DLT, the dose will escalate.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dose 1 Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose 1- Inhaled Nitrous Oxide (iNO) 40ppm.","interventionNames":["Drug: iNO"]},{"label":"Dose 2 Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose 2- Inhaled Nitrous Oxide (iNO) 50ppm.","interventionNames":["Drug: iNO"]},{"label":"Dose 3 Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose 3- Inhaled Nitrous Oxide (iNO) 60ppm.","interventionNames":["Drug: iNO"]},{"label":"Dose 4 Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose 4- Inhaled Nitrous Oxide (iNO) 70ppm.","interventionNames":["Drug: iNO"]},{"label":"Dose 5 Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose 5- Inhaled Nitrous Oxide (iNO) 80ppm.","interventionNames":["Drug: iNO"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"iNO","description":"Inhaled Nitrous Oxide","armGroupLabels":["Dose 1 Group","Dose 2 Group","Dose 3 Group","Dose 4 Group","Dose 5 Group"],"otherNames":["Inhaled Nitrous Oxide"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximum safe dose of iNO for AIS patients - assessing for reperfusion hemorrhage/symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"To establish a maximum safe dose of iNO for acute ischemic (non-bleeding) stroke (AIS) patients, assessing for reperfusion hemorrhage/symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)","timeFrame":"Year 2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in pre-endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (IAMT) and post-IAMT core infarct volume","description":"Core infarct measurement pre/post","timeFrame":"Year 2"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 and \\< 80\n* Clinical evidence of acute ischemic (non-bleeding) stroke (AIS) with NIH Stroke Scale of 6 or higher\n* Non-contrast Computed tomography (CT) Head with ASPECT (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT) score 6\n* Symptom onset began \\< 16 hours from initiation of intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (IAMT) procedure\n* CT Angiogram (CTA) evidence of anterior circulation MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) M1 segment occlusion.\n* CT Perfusion (CTP) evidence of core infarct volume of \\< 70ml and a ratio of ischemic tissue to initial core infarct volume of 1.8 or greater, and an absolute volume of penumbra of 15ml or greater\n* Patient or patient's representative provides consent\n* Pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of \\< =2\n* General endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) is planned to be used, as standard care, for IAMT\n* Treatment with iNO requires mechanical ventilation.
