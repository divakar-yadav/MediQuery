The abnormal amplitude registered by TST is proportional to the intensity of conduction disorders. The evaluation of these disorders is more precise with this technique than with the slowing of the central conduction time (CCT).\n\nThe investigators propose to use this technique in CNS pathologies where this disorder is significant and essential, like multiple sclerosis and stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["TST","TMS","Stroke patients","EMG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients will be submitted to a triple stimulation examination.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Triple stimulation technique"]},{"label":"Control Subjects","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group of patients did not suffer from a stroke.

This procedure combines two techniques: the magnetic stimulation and the electroneuromyography. It is based on the double collision principle between the descending central stimulation (magnetic) and the ascending peripheric stimulation, hereby suppressing the issue of desynchronisation of evoked motor potentials. The Triple stimulation technique allows a better quantification of the proportion of motor units activated by the transcranial stimulation.","armGroupLabels":["Control Subjects","Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Amplitude of the motor evoked potentials","timeFrame":"during the TST (30 min)"},{"measure":"Surface of the motor evoked potentials","timeFrame":"during the TST (30 min)"},{"measure":"Amplitude ratio of the TST","timeFrame":"during the TST (30 min)"},{"measure":"Surface ratio of the TST","timeFrame":"during the TST (30 min)"},{"measure":"TMS threshold","timeFrame":"during TST (30 min)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke patients with hemiparesia\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pace maker\n* epilepsia\n* metallic neurosurgical implants","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bernard Dachy, MD","affiliation":"CHU Brugmann","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Andrey Bragin, MD","affiliation":"CHU Brugmann","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Pedro Calderon, MD","affiliation":"CHU Brugmann","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Brugmann","city":"Brussels","zip":"1020","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.85045,"lon":4.34878}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"9549520","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Magistris MR, Rosler KM, Truffert A, Myers JP.
