These results are important because, to the investigators' knowledge, there have been no other reports of the restoration of coordinated gait components for those with persistent gait deficits (\\> 6 months after stroke). However, a remaining problem was that the restored coordinated gait movements measured in the laboratory did not generalize for many subjects to the everyday environment. The confluence of several factors can cause lack of generalization. First, dual task performance (gait and cognitive attention task) can degrade both gait and attention ability, even in healthy adults. Second, stroke can impair attention. Third, during walking in the everyday environment, attention is required in order to safely process normally occurring stimuli. Therefore, given the success of the new gait training protocol in the lab setting, it is important to address the problems remaining for generalization of the recovered coordinated gait pattern to the everyday environment. The primary hypothesis of this study is that greater gains in gait speed will be produced by combined motor and cognitive training versus motor training alone.","detailedDescription":"Aim 1, Hypothesis Ia: Comparison of combined motor and cognitive training vs motor training alone. For Aim 1, Hypothesis Ia, this will be a randomized, controlled study. For the two groups, 38 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either: A) Motor + Cognitive Training; or B) Motor Training alone. Subjects will first be stratified according to coordination and gait deficit severity, as described below. After stratification, the subject will be randomized to one of the two intervention groups for Hypothesis Ia. All the subjects will receive treatment 5 times/week, 3hrs/session, for 12 weeks or for a total of 60 treatment sessions. Group A will receive combined motor and cognitive training; Table 2 (below) shows the graduated approach to providing combined gait and cognitive training. Data collection will be at weeks 1, 6, 12, and 24 (i.e., before, mid-treatment and after treatment, and then 3 months after the end of the treatment protocol. Comparison will be made between the two groups to determine whether there was any additive effectiveness of the cognitive training.\n\nAim 2, Hypotheses IIa-d: Pre/post-treatment comparisons within Group A, receiving combined motor and cognitive training. For Aim 2, Hypotheses IIa-d, this will be a single cohort pre/post-treatment comparison within Group A receiving combined motor and cognitive training.\n\nAim 3, Hypotheses IIIa-d: Pre/post-treatment comparisons within Group B, receiving motor training alone. For Aim 3, Hypotheses IIIa-d, this will be a single cohort pre/post-treatment comparison within Group B, receiving motor training alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","walking","cognition","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gait plus cognitive training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Rehabilitation of walking/gait, combined with rehabilitation of cognitive function","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Gait training","Behavioral: cognitive training"]},{"label":"Gait plus arm training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Rehabilitation of walking/gait, combined with rehabilitation of arm function","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Gait training","Behavioral: Arm training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Gait training","description":"Treatment will include coordination exercises and over ground gait training for impaired muscle groups and related gait deficits.
