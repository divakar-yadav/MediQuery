This includes the design and planning of appropriate rehabilitation settings, intervention and logistics for organizing space for patients.\n\nThe aims of this study are: (a) to evaluate the feasibility of the bedside use of a novel rehabilitation device for upper limb in patients with stroke; (b) to evaluate the motor and cognitive outcomes of the treatment; (c) to validate the instrumental outcomes provided by the device.","detailedDescription":"This study aims to:\n\n1. evaluate the feasibility of the bedside use of a novel portable rehabilitation device for upper limb in patients with stroke in an inpatient setting;\n2. assess motor and cognitive outcomes of the treatment;\n3. validate the instrumental outcomes provided by the device.\n\nForty subacute stroke patients with upper limb hemiplegia will be enrolled. Patients' upper limb will be treated with a novel portable robotic device (Icone, Heaxel). The robot will be transferred to each patient's room, where the rehabilitation session will be performed, thanks to the portability of the device. During the treatment, patients will execute \"exergames\" involving elbow flexion-extension, shoulder protraction-retraction, internal-external rotation, flexion-extension and abduction-adduction. The exercises will be selected among the available ones to train both motor and cognitive functions. The rehabilitation intervention will include 30 rehabilitation sessions, each lasting 45 minutes, three to five times a week. In addition to the upper limb treatment, patients will receive a rehabilitation treatment for the lower limbs.\n\nFor Aim 1, the usability and the acceptability of the device and the satisfaction with the treatment will be evaluated at the end of the rehabilitation intervention by means of the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Likert scale, respectively.\n\nFor Aim 2, the clinical effect of the treatment with the robot will be investigated by means of the following scales, assessed both at baseline and at discharge: the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremity (FMA-UE), the Motricity Index (MI), the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the Modified Barthel Index (mBI), the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)\n\nFor Aim 3, at baseline, each patient will perform the kinematic and kinetic assessment provided by the robot twice, one day apart, to assess the reliability of the kinematic parameters provided by the robot; moreover, the kinematic and kinetics assessment will be performed every ten rehabilitation sessions, to analyze the responsiveness of the kinematic parameters and possible \"plateau\" in the recovery process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","stroke","upper extremity","robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Upper limb robotic rehabilitation by means of the portable robot Icone.","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic therapy","description":"The treatment with the robot Icone will include 30 sessions, each session lasting 45 minutes, with a frequency from three to five times a week.
