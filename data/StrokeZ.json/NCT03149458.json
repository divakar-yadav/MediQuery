Conventional techniques used in rehabilitation improve balance but have shown no effects on dynamic balance required during walking. Recently dance is proposed to improve dynamic balance in older people and people with Parkinson's disease. Although many studies showed that dance is an effective activity to improve balance in these people, it has never been assessed in hemiparetic patients (except a case report). The aim of this study is to show that a dance program improves the balance of hemiparetic patients, compared to a control group. This randomized controlled study aims to include 40 hemiparetic patients who will perform a dance program (experimental group) or a upper-limb rehabilitation program (control group) for 8 one-hour sessions.","detailedDescription":"Randomized controlled study aims to include 40 hemiparetic patients who will perform a dance program (experimental group) or a upper-limb rehabilitation program (control group) for 8 one-hour sessions. These activities are carried out in the form of a workshop and are already proposed in common practice in the service. They are carried out by the physiotherapists of the service. Patients are assigned in one of two study groups. It is specified that they will be able to carry out the program of the opposing group at the end of the study in order to limit the \"disappointment\" effect. The evaluations will be carried out at 4 and 8 weeks and will mainly rely on data of balance, function, quality of life and satisfaction"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["stroke","balance","dance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dance group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"dance program for 8 one-hour sessions.","interventionNames":["Other: dance"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"upper limb rehabilitation for 8 one-hour sessions.","interventionNames":["Other: control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"dance","description":"dance program","armGroupLabels":["Dance group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"control","description":"upper limb rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed up and Go","description":"get up, walk 3m, turn around and return sit down","timeFrame":"5min"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"clinical scale assessing balance. 14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting.
