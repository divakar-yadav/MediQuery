Reperfusion therapies of the occluded artery remain the only useful approach in acute ischemic stroke. However, the efficacy of these strategies is highly time-dependent and due to the need of neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, impossible to be performed at the pre-hospital level. The investigators aim to set-up a point of-care (POC) device to validate a biomarker panel differentiating ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke at the pre-hospital level using a blood sample and to validate a second biomarker panel for the early identification of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO), which are candidates for mechanical thrombectomy. For that, the investigators will recruit a 300 patients' cohort with pre-hospital blood samples using available POCs for each of those markers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["blood biomarkers","stroke diagnosis","stroke","biomarkers","reperfusion therapies","acute stroke therapy","prehospital stroke management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":176,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke subtype diagnostic accuracy","description":"Stroke subtype diagnostic (% ischemic versus % hemorrhagic and % stroke mimics) will be determined by clinical and neuroimaging criteria at hospital arrival and compared with diagnostic accuracy of a blood biomarkers based test","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 2 years"},{"measure":"Reperfusion rates","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 2 years"},{"measure":"Times to reperfusion","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* I.1: Patients \\> 18 years old.\n* I.2: Stroke code activated by the coordinator centre.\n* I.3: \\< 6 hours from symptoms onset.
