Evidence of neural repair in humans can be gleaned indirectly through functional outcome measures, but we propose that metabolomics may also provide a minimally invasive window into human brain repair. This study will integrate clinical imaging and molecular biomarkers as a diagnostic tool in further understanding stroke recovery mechanisms.","detailedDescription":"Our long-term goal is to improve and hasten recovery following a stroke with translational research, which would combine the use of neuroimaging and identify neural repair metabolites. The objective and sequential step in fulfilling our long-term goal, is to identify differential expression of select stroke plasma biomarkers of neural repair, and image CST integrity in patients with good and poor recovery following an ischemic stroke. Diffusion tension imaging (DTI), will be used to image the neural repair as it occurs, further enhancing our understanding of stroke recovery. There are currently no known plasma biomarkers of neural repair. Identification of such biomarkers would be extremely valuable for designing stroke recovery drugs and timing rehabilitation therapies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DTI Outcomes and Biomarkers","type":"OTHER","description":"Imaging and Lab Collection","interventionNames":["Other: DTI Images and Plasma Biomarkers"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"DTI Images and Plasma Biomarkers","description":"Additional Images added from standard of care MRI, Bio-markers identified","armGroupLabels":["DTI Outcomes and Biomarkers"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Establish plasma metabolite biomarkers that mirror neuronal repair and identify structural changes following ischemic strokes","description":"Identify differential expression of select stroke plasma biomarkers of neural repair through metabolic testing and imaging CST integrity in patients with good and poor recovery following an ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer","description":"The Fugl-Meyer will be used to assess motor function at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers, hip, knee, and foot.
