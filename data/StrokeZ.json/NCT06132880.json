Patients in intervention group will be given 0.15 peptide nucleic acids (PNA) Human Urinary Kallidinogenase concentrated solution for intravenous injection once a day for 10 days continuously, and those in the control group will be given conventional therapy. Both groups of patients will be on standard stroke care. In this study, patients who were eligible to the inclusion criteria and ineligible to the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into two groups by a 1:1 ratio after the informed consent form (ICF) was received. The total sample size will be 540. All patients will be followed up for 90 days. The primary outcome is the proportion of modified Rankin Scale 0-2. Besides, the investigators aimed to use computed tomography perfusion (CTP) evaluate the differences of ischemic penumbra volume and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) before and after treatment between intervention group and control group.\n\nFurthermore, this study adopts adaptive design, prospectively stating interim analyses with specified stopping rules, which allow for the possibility of the study to terminate early based on either determination of study success or of the futility to continue further enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Functional Outcomes"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Functional Outcomes","Early cerebral perfusion","Human Urinary Kallidinogenase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":540,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous injections of urinary kallidinogenase (0.15 peptide nucleic acids (PNA) in 0.9% NaCl) intravenous drip quaquedie (QD) for 10 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Human Urinary Kallidinogenase","Other: Clinical Routine Treatment"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Conventional therapy of acute ischemic stroke after based on Chinese guidelines.","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical Routine Treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Human Urinary Kallidinogenase","description":"Intravenous injections of urinary kallidinogenase (0.15 peptide nucleic acids (PNA) in 0.9% NaCl) intravenous drip QD for 10 days.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical Routine Treatment","description":"Conventional therapy of acute ischemic stroke after based on Chinese guidelines","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2 at day 90","description":"The proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2 at day 90. mRS scores range from 0 to 6. 0=no symptoms,1 = symptoms without clinically significant disability,2 = slight disability,3 = moderate disability,4 = moderately severe disability,5 = severe disability; and 6 = death.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Tmax>6s volume","description":"Change of Tmax\\>6s volume on CTP from baseline to 5 days after treatment","timeFrame":"5 days"},{"measure":"Change of rCBF in Tmax>6s area","description":"Change of rCBF in Tmax\\>6s area on CTP from baseline to 5 days after treatment","timeFrame":"5 days"},{"measure":"Ordinal distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90","description":"Ordinal distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90. mRS scores range from 0 to 6. 0=no symptoms,1 = symptoms without clinically significant disability,2 = slight disability,3 = moderate disability,4 = moderately severe disability,5 = severe disability; and 6 = death.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 at day 90","description":"The proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 at day 90. mRS scores range from 0 to 6. 0=no symptoms,1 = symptoms without clinically significant disability,2 = slight disability,3 = moderate disability,4 = moderately severe disability,5 = severe disability; and 6 = death.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Change of National Institute of Health stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at day 5 after treatment.","description":"Change of National Institute of Health stroke Scale (NIHSS) score from baseline to 5 days after treatment.
