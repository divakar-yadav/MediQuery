Participants will use the HandSOME at home regularly for 8 weeks. Clinical evaluations will measure changes from the intervention after the 8 weeks and also at a 3 month followup.","detailedDescription":"After stroke, individuals often have great difficulty with using the affected hand in functional tasks. The hand frequently suffers from finger flexor hypertonia as well as finger extensor weakness. This leads to increased difficulty in grasp and release of objects. HandSOME is a light weight wearable hand orthosis that increases range of motion and decreases effort during grasping tasks. The goal of this study is to evaluate the HandSOME device's effectiveness in the rehabilitation of stroke patients through an 8 week intervention. Eligible subjects will use the device daily at home for 8 weeks with one visit per week to the clinic to evaluate progress and troubleshoot problems with the device. The hypotheses are that the gains from the 8 weeks of training will be statistically significant and clinically important (defined as gains of greater than 10% of full scale) in the domains of impairment, function and amount of arm use."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HandSOME","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention is given to this group.","interventionNames":["Device: HandSOME"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"HandSOME","description":"Participants use the HandSOME orthosis daily for 8 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["HandSOME"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Test of Arm Function","description":"clinical test of arm motor ability and impairment","timeFrame":"Change from baseline Fugl-Meyer score at 2 months"},{"measure":"Change in Action Research Arm Test","description":"clinical test of the functional limitations of the upper extremities","timeFrame":"Change from baseline Action Research Arm Test score at 2 months"},{"measure":"Change in Motor Activity Log","description":"assess the amount and quality of limb use at home","timeFrame":"Change from baseline Motor Activity Log score at 2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Test of Arm Function at followup","description":"clinical test of arm motor ability and impairment","timeFrame":"Change from baseline Fugl-Meyer score at 5 months"},{"measure":"Change in Action Research Arm Test at followup","description":"clinical test of the functional limitations of the upper extremities","timeFrame":"Change from baseline Action Research Arm Test score at 5 months"},{"measure":"Change in Motor Activity Log at followup","description":"assess the amount and quality of limb use at home","timeFrame":"Change from baseline Motor Activity Log score at 5 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
