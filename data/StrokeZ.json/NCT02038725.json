Rapid assessment and treatment can reduce the risk. Several international guidelines recommend a test, the ABCD2 score, to identify TIA patients with low and high risk for stroke. The main purpose of this study is to investigate stroke risk after TIA in both short (1 week) and long term (3 months/1 year), and to assess whether the ABCD2 score ('Age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA, diabetes score) is an adequate tool for predicting stroke risk. Secondary aims are to explore whether adopting imaging modalities (ultrasound, MRI) and biological markers of blood into a risk score could improve the predictive value of the ABCD2 score and still be feasible in a daily clinical practice. Further on overall risk factors in TIA patients, and the incidence of other vascular events will be studied. A substudy designed as a randomised controlled trial evaluates pharmaceutical counseling in a subset of participants. Cost-benefit analysis, and a long-term follow-up (5 years) is planned."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Attack, Transient","Stroke"],"keywords":["Risks","Risk Factors","ABCD2 score","Predictive Value of Tests","Risk Assessment","Severity of Illness Index","Decision Support Techniques"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":584,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TIA in last 2 weeks"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients presenting with stroke within 1 week after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by using data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry","timeFrame":"1 week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients presenting with stroke within 3 months after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by using data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Correlation between the ABCD2 score and the incidence of stroke within 1 week after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by comparing the ABCD2 score and the incidence of stroke within 1 week after transient ischemic attack based on data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Correlation between the ABCD2 score and the incidence of stroke within 3 months after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by comparing the ABCD2 score and the incidence of stroke within 3 months after transient ischemic attack based on data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of other vascular events within 1 week after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by using data from national health registries","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Cost-benefit analysis","description":"Economic analysis that compares the costs of admission to hospital versus outpatient assessment of patients who have had transient ischemic attacks","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Number of patients presenting with stroke within 1 year after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by using data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Correlation between the ABCD2 score and the incidence of stroke within 1 year after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by comparing the ABCD2 score and the incidence of stroke within 1 year after transient ischemic attack based on data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Incidence of other vascular events within 3 months after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by using data from national health registries","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of other vascular events within 1 year after transient ischemic attack","description":"Measured by using data from national health registries","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Probable or possible transient ischemic attack\n* Residing in Central Norway\n* Examined within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms\n* Modified Rankin Scale 3 or less and living at home\n* Informed consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients referred to a hospital in Central Norway with a recent probable or possible transient ischemic attack","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bent Indredavik, PhD, Prof","affiliation":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kristiansund Sykehus","city":"Kristiansund","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":63.11045,"lon":7.72795}},{"facility":"Levanger Sykehus","city":"Levanger","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":63.74644,"lon":11.29963}},{"facility":"Molde Sykehus","city":"Molde","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":62.73752,"lon":7.15912}},{"facility":"Namsos Sykehus","city":"Namsos","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":64.46624,"lon":11.49572}},{"facility":"Orkdal Sykehus","city":"Orkanger","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":63.30668,"lon":9.85025}},{"facility":"St Olavs Hospital","city":"Trondheim","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":63.43049,"lon":10.39506}},{"facility":"Volda Sykehus","city":"Volda","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":62.146,"lon":6.07108}},{"facility":"Ålesund Sykehus","city":"Ålesund","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":62.47225,"lon":6.15492}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"type":"RESULT","citation":"Ildstad F, Ellekjaer H, Fjaertoft H, Indredavik B.
