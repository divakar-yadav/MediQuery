Optical cerebral blood flow measurements will be correlated with changes in arterial blood pressure to assess how CBF is maintained in response to changes in ABP, and will be compared to transcranial doppler reference measurements."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"We will measure dCA with both TCD and DCS during acute changes in mean arterial pressure using thigh cuff deflation techniques in vascular risk factor subjects.
