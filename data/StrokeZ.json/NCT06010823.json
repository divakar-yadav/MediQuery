Many stroke and TBI patients encounter severe functional impairments of their arm and/or hand. Recent studies have indicated that robotic training can improve upper limb function by enabling repetitive, adaptive, and intensive training.\n\nOne type of robotic training is error enhancement during three-dimensional movements. The goal of this approach is to elicit better accuracy, stability, fluidity and range of motion during reaching.\n\nPrevious research indicated the potential of robotic training with error enhancement as a viable clinical intervention for individuals facing motor deficits.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new robotic system based on error enhancement and intended for rehabilitation of motor hand functions of post-stroke and TBI patients.\n\nMethods: A randomized, multi-center study with an open-label design. The study sample will consist of 96 participants who will be randomized into 2 separate groups. The intervention group consisting of 48 patients will receive training with the new robotic system, while the control group consisting of additional 48 patients will receive only standard practice treatments (with no exposure to the new robotic system). The outcomes of safety (adverse events and treatment tolerability), and efficacy (motor function, speed, tone, and spasticity) will be assessed and compared between the two groups. The assessment of the outcomes will be conducted at four different time points: (1) prior to the initiation of the four-week intervention, (2) after 2 weeks of intervention, (3) at the conclusion of the intervention, and (4) at a three-month follow-up session.","detailedDescription":"Background: Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes for morbidity, hospitalization, and extended injury of motor system as well as movement learning. It has been proven that roughly 85% of stroke survivors suffer from weakness in their upper limbs, and around 40% of stroke survivors will suffer from severe handicap in their paretic arm, negatively affecting their independence and quality of life. Statically, about 50% - 70% of survivors will recover enough to enable daily use of their arm. These numbers indicate that although rehabilitation for stroke patients is evident, there remains a need for more effective methods.\n\nTraditional rehabilitative methods are often time-consuming and labor-intensive. Only a few of these methods induce slightly improved arm function, and a full recovery is often not achieved. Recently, studies have indicated that robotic training has promise for improving functional abilities among stroke survivors by enabling repetitive, adaptive, intensive, and accurate control of task complexity during the rehabilitation period. One type of robotic training that is particularly promising is error enhancement; this utilizes the adaptive capabilities of the nervous system to improve fine motor function of the arm.\n\nStudy Objectives: To evaluate the change in the upper limb function amongst post-stroke and post-TBI patients undergoing error enhancement treatment compared to a control group in the following domains:\n\n1. Motor Function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), pinch and grip tests)\n2. Speed (Box and Blocks Assessment)\n3. Tone and Spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale)\n\nIn addition, this study will examine the safety and patient tolerability of the device.\n\nMethods Population: A total of 96 participants will be recruited within 3 medical centers participating in the study. The recruitment will take place between 14 days and up to 18 months after the onset of the stroke or brain injury.\n\nRecruitment: Electronic medical records of newly hospitalized patients will be screened to identify potential study participants. All eligible patients will be offered to participate. After obtaining informed consent, an intake session will take place for screening and evaluation purposes, conducted by a qualified occupational therapist. Patients successfully passing the screening session will undergo randomization to one of the two study arms with 1:1 ratio in each of the medical centers conducting the study.\n\nAll the treatments will be conducted a separate occupational therapist who will be blinded to the patient allocation group. Patients in the intervention arm will undergo training sessions with the robotic device, 3 times a week for a period up to 4 weeks, while the patients in the control arm will receive standard rehabilitative care.\n\nPatients in both groups will undergo additional evaluation sessions at the following time points: after 2 weeks of intervention, at the conclusion of the intervention (4 weeks), and at a three-month follow-up session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Injuries","Paresis","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases"],"keywords":["Brain plasticity","Upper limb function","Robotic rehabilitation","Error augmentation or enhancement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":96,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All the participants allocated to this group will undergo rehabilitation according to each medical center's standard rehabilitation practice.
