It was recommended that patients be continued on standard care of aspirin mono therapy until their study close-out visit. Also, recommended the continuation and completion of the plood pressure arm following the protocol.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is damage to the brain caused by problems in the blood vessels. Strokes often cause paralysis, loss of sensation and speech, and other problems. A lacunar or small Subcortical stroke affects the inner part of the brain causing small \"pea sized\" areas of damage due to blockage of small blood vessels within the brain.\n\nThis multi-center study will recruit 3000 participants (20 percent of whom will be Hispanic) to find out if using aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than using aspirin alone to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with lacunar stroke confirmed by MRI, and if lowering a patient's blood pressure below the usual limits will also help prevent recurrent stroke and maintain thinking ability. Both aspirin and clopidogrel are widely-used for blood clotting and stroke prevention. Investigators intend to find out if using the drugs together is more effective than using aspirin alone.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 types of treatment: either aspirin alone or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. In addition, participants will be assigned to one of 2 groups of blood pressure control. The difference between the two groups is the target level of systolic blood pressure-either 130-149 or below 130. The goal of the blood pressure aspect of this trial is to find out if lowering blood pressure after stroke helps to prevent recurrent stroke and preserves cognition."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Hypertension"],"keywords":["stroke","hypertension","high blood pressure","lacunar stroke","subcortical stroke","aspirin","clopidogrel"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3020,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Antiplatelet","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants receive aspirin + placebo OR aspirin + clopidogrel","interventionNames":["Drug: aspirin","Drug: clopidogrel","Other: placebo"]},{"label":"Blood pressure","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The goal of the blood pressure aspect of this trial is to find out if lowering blood pressure after stroke helps to prevent recurrent stroke and preserves cognition.","interventionNames":["Other: Target of Blood Pressure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"aspirin","description":"Participants receive aspirin + placebo, specifically: aspirin (325 mg) with placebo (an inactive substance).
