The study will have three arms, with each group receiving one of the following interventions: table-based cognitive training (NeuroAIreh@b), paper-and-pencil cognitive training (Task Generator) or no intervention (waiting-list control group). The latter group will not receive intervention during the study but will be offered the opportunity to participate in one of the cognitive training programs after completing the study. Additionally, the investigators will assess participants at three different time points: before the intervention (pre-intervention), immediately after the intervention (post-intervention), and three months after the intervention (follow-up)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participants won't be aware of which group they are randomized to.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group 1.
