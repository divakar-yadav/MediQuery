Patient must be living in their own home, apartment or seniors lodge where no nursing care is required.\n* Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and referred to interventional neuroradiology center for mechanical thrombectomy with study enrollment time planned within 8 hours from onset of symptoms.\n* Disabling stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS \\> 6.\n* Thrombolytic therapy (IV tPA) received within 4.5 hours of onset/ last known well according to prescribed dosing OR documented ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy.\n* Confirmed symptomatic, large vessel occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, M1, or M2 with mTICI 0-1.\n* The following baseline imaging criteria should be met: MRI criterion- volume of diffusion restriction visually assessed ≤50 mL OR ASPECTs score 5-10 or T criterion- ASPECTS 6-10 on imaging NE-CT, CTA and/or CTP available\n* Signed informed consent from patient or legal representative or if applicable, documented medical necessity for inclusion in a clinical study in an emergency followed by signed informed consent.\n* Patient is affiliated in the social security system.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of recent/ fresh hemorrhage on presentation.\n* Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic.\n* Rapidly improving neurological deficits based on the investigator's clinical judgement.\n* Pregnancy; if a woman is of child-bearing potential and urine or serum beta HCG test is positive.\n* Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.\n* Renal failure (serum creatinine level ≥ 3 mg/dL or on dialysis).\n* Severe, sustained hypertension resistant to treatment (SBP \\>185 mmHg or DBP \\>110 mmHg).\n* Use of warfarin anticoagulation (or other applicable anti-vitamin k anticoagulants) with International Normalized Ratio (INR) \\> 3.0 at the time of the procedure or any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency.\n* Use of a direct thrombin inhibitor within the last 48 hours; partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\> 2.0 times the normal prior to procedure.\n* Cerebral vasculitis or evidence of active systemic infection.\n* Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial endocarditis.\n* Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).\n* Seizure due to stroke.\n* Difficult endovascular access, difficult aortic arch or severe neurovascular tortuosity that will result in an inability to deliver endovascular therapy.\n* Evidence of dissection in the carotid or target artery for treatment.\n* Presence of a carotid artery stenosis or occlusion requiring balloon angioplasty or stenting at time of the procedure.\n* A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.\n* Patient cannot undergo an MRI of the head due to MRI contraindication.\n* Patient is unable or unwilling complete follow up visits.\n* If before the stroke, the patient is under a legal protective measure, they will not be able to participate in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Christophe Cognard, MD, PhD","affiliation":"CHU Toulouse","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Pellegrin","city":"Bordeaux","zip":"33000","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":44.84044,"lon":-0.5805}},{"facility":"CHU Montpellier","city":"Montpellier","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.61092,"lon":3.87723}},{"facility":"CHU Urbains","city":"Nancy","zip":"54035","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.68439,"lon":6.18496}},{"facility":"CHU Bicetre Paris","city":"Paris","zip":"94270","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}},{"facility":"Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere","city":"Paris","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}},{"facility":"Hôpital Purpan","city":"Toulouse","zip":"31059","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.60426,"lon":1.44367}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
