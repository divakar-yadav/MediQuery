The purpose of the 2BE3 trial is to test whether adjunct rescue treatment of persisting distal occlusions after successful proximal recanalization of the large vessel occlusion can be proposed as an additional intervention to restore reperfusion of affected stroke tissue and improve clinical outcomes.\n\nThe rescue therapies will be either mechanical (small stent retrievers and/or small aspiration catheters) or pharmacological (infusion of intra-arterial thrombolytics).\n\nPatients will be randomized to conservative management (mechanical thrombectomy with or without IV thrombolytics of large proximal vessels) or rescue therapy (mechanical or pharmacological interventions in distal vessels in addition to conservative management). Each patient will be followed for 3 months post-intervention.\n\nThe data collected will be clinical assessments and angiographic imaging to evaluate the reperfusion state.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of the 2BE3 trial is to provide a clinical trial context for the use of rescue therapy (mechanical or pharmacological therapies) in patients with persistent distal occlusions after treatment of large vessel occlusions with mechanical thrombectomy and IV thrombolytics. The main hypothesis is that rescue therapy with mechanical or pharmacological therapies, compared with conservative management would result in improved clinical and reperfusion scores at 90 days.\n\nThe extent of reperfusion is an interesting therapeutic target because reperfusion status is a strong indicator of clinical outcome: grades of better reperfusion are incrementally associated with better clinical outcomes. Despite increased expertise of neuro-interventional teams and the evolution in thrombectomy devices, incomplete reperfusion occurs in almost half of patients undergoing treatment of large vessel occlusions. Thus, complementary treatments targeting distal occlusions and known as \"rescue therapy\" have been introduced to reach complete or near complete reperfusion.\n\nThe devices and techniques proposed as rescue therapies include small stent retrievers, small aspiration catheters and intra-arterial thrombolytics. Case studies and registries have shown high reperfusion rates and low rates of periprocedural complications; however, there is lack of randomized data to show the impact of rescue therapies on patient outcomes and safety compared to conservative management (treatment of large vessel occlusions only). A randomized clinical trial is therefore needed.\n\nThe 2BE3 trial is a simple randomized trial designed to be integrated into daily clinical practice. It will address whether rescue therapies truly offer a safe and more effective alternative to conservative management. Selection criteria are loose in order to be of use to most patients. Endpoints are simple, clinical, meaningful, valuable and resistant to bias. It includes no extra risk or cost of visits beyond what is required in routine care.\n\nThe design is multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label study with blinded evaluation (PROBE design). The study population is acute ischemic stroke patients with persistent distal occlusions after treatment of large vessel occlusion with mechanical thrombectomy and/or intravenous thrombolysis. The total number of patients will be 300, 150 in each arm, each followed for 3 months post-intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Thrombotic"],"keywords":["Large vessel occlusion","Persistent distal occlusion","Mechanical thrombectomy","Intra-arterial thrombolytics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conservative management","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy of large vessel occlusions with or without administration of IV thrombolytics","interventionNames":["Device: Mechanical thrombectomy in proximal large vessels"]},{"label":"Rescue therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In addition to conservative management, rescue therapy in distal occlusions consisting of either mechanical thrombectomy with small stent retrievers with or without contact aspiration, or intra-arterial pharmacotherapy with tPA (tissue Plasminogen Activator), uPA (urokinase Plasminogen Activator) or tenecteplase.","interventionNames":["Device: Mechanical thrombectomy in proximal large vessels","Device: Rescue mechanical thrombectomy in distal vessels"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Mechanical thrombectomy in proximal large vessels","description":"mechanical thrombectomy with retrievable stents to remove clots in proximal large vessels, combined or not with distal aspiration, combined or not with IV thrombolytics","armGroupLabels":["Conservative management","Rescue therapy"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Rescue mechanical thrombectomy in distal vessels","description":"In addition to mechanical thrombectomy in proximal large vessels, mechanical thrombectomy in distal vessels with small stent retrievers combined or not with contact aspiration, or intra-arterial perfusion of thrombolytics such as tPA or uPA or tenecpeplase","armGroupLabels":["Rescue therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2.
