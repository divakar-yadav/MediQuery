Eighty-four eligible participants who had suffered from stroke with less than 6 months and could slightly move their arms were randomly allocated to either an experimental, sham, or control group stratified by hemiplegic arm functional levels. Patients in the experimental group were treated by RTM using wearable devices, 3 consecutive hours daily, for 4 weeks. The sham group used sham devices. The control group received the usual care. A masked assessor evaluated the participants at 0, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks. Outcome measures included arm function tests, motor activity log, movement amount and percentage recorded by wearable devices. All patients allocated to treatment were included in intention-to-treat analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive \"Remind-to-move\" by means of vibration emitted through sensory cueing wristwatch devices, 3 consecutive hours daily, for 4 weeks, as well as usual care during the intervention period.They are also encouraged to use their arms as much as possible and the accelerometer built-in the device record the arm movement during daily activities.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Remind-to-move","Other: Control"]},{"label":"Sham treatment","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants wear sham wristwatch devices but without vibration cueing, 3 consecutive hours daily, for 4 weeks, as well as usual care during the intervention period.
