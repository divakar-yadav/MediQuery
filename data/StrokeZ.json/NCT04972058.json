Data will be collected from each patient while admitted in the hospital and until hospital discharge. Data collection for this study will span 3 years from study initiation, after which the utility of an extension or a re-implementation of the study will be assessed.","detailedDescription":"Primary objective is to prospectively collect data on demographics, medical history, in-hospital management, and outcomes among patients with first or recurrent TIA or ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke admitted in accredited adult neurology training institutions in the Philippines.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\n1. To determine the in-patient case load of first and recurrent TIA and stroke.\n2. To determine the profile of patients admitted for first or recurrent TIA or stroke.\n3. To determine the types of diagnostic and therapeutic management received by patients with first or recurrent TIA or stroke.\n4. To determine the outcomes of patients with first or recurrent TIA or stroke at the time of hospital discharge.\n5. To evaluate factors that predict outcome among patients with first or recurrent TIA or stroke.\n6. To assess and audit the overall quality of care received by patients admitted for first or recurrent TIA or stroke.\n7. To perform other future analyses, sanctioned by the Philippine Neurological Association (PNA), that may improve knowledge on the care of patients with first and/or recurrent TIA or stroke.\n\nAll eligible patients will be assigned a study identification (ID) number and included in the site log kept confidentially in each site. Corresponding anonymized data on demographics, medical history, stroke sub-type, in-hospital management and discharge outcomes will be collected from each patient and entered in the database using a secure online data collection tool.\n\nCollective data will be extracted, summarized, and analyzed for the secondary objectives every year with oversight provided by the Philippine Neurological Association."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transient Ischemic Attack","Ischemic Stroke","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Cerebral Venous Thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"In-hospital caseload","description":"Number of TIA and stroke cases admitted in participating sites.","timeFrame":"3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"In-hospital diagnostic procedure (brain scan)","description":"Rate of performance of brain scan.","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital diagnostic procedures (electrocardiogram)","description":"Rate of performance of electrocardiogram.","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital diagnostic procedures (echocardiogram)","description":"Rate of performance of echocardiogram.","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital diagnostic procedures (cerebral vascular studies)","description":"Rate of performance of any cerebral vascular study.","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital therapeutic management (thrombolysis)","description":"Rate of treatment with thrombolysis (intravenous and/or endovascular).","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital therapeutic management (anti-thrombotics)","description":"Rate of treatment with any anti-thrombotic (anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulant).","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital therapeutic management (rehabilitation)","description":"Rate of rehabilitation (physical therapy and/or occupational therapy and or speech therapy).","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"In-hospital complications from TIA or stroke","description":"Rate of complications arising from TIA or stroke.","timeFrame":"From admission to discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"Vital status at hospital discharge","description":"Alive or dead","timeFrame":"At discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"Functional status at hospital discharge","description":"modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"At discharge, may be up to 1 month"},{"measure":"Neurological status at hospital discharge","description":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"At discharge, may be up to 1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
