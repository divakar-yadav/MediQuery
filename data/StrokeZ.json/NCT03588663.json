Patients will be tested during a range of activities (sit-to-stand, walking) with and without the Bionic Leg, and following a 30-min training program.","detailedDescription":"The aim of this study is to investigate the acute effect of wearing a Bionic Leg on:\n\n1. The Physiological Cost Index (PCI) and Biomechanical measures (gait, postural sway) of stroke patients compared to when they do not wear a Bionic Leg.\n2. Whether after wearing a Bionic Leg for 30-minutes during a training session influences the Physiological Cost Index (PCI) and any Biomechanical measures (gait, postural sway) of stroke patients\n\nIndividuals who volunteer to participate in the present study will be asked to engage in 4 sessions in the laboratory. Firstly, participants will be asked to take part in two familiarisation sessions, which will be delivered on two separate occasions. These sessions will last one-hour each and will allow participants (stroke patients) to become accustomed to wearing and using the Bionic Leg. Sessions will consist of sit to stand, walking and stairs exercises, which will allow individuals to become familiarised with the Bionic Leg device. They will then be asked to complete 6x 10m walks to identify their self-selected walking pace. In session 3, individuals will be randomly assigned to either use the Bionic Leg, or not. Participants will initially be asked to stay seated and rested for 5 minutes so a resting heart rate can be taken. If participants are assigned to the Bionic Leg condition first, they will conduct all the following tests with the Bionic leg on, however, if not, they will perform all the tests without wearing the Bionic Leg. They will then partake in a 3-minute walk test, which will include walking at their self-selected pace (found in session 1) for 3 minutes. Following this a 15-minute rest period will be taken, and 3 x timed-up and go tests will be conducted (see outcome measures). Next, participants will be asked to take part in a balance test, and then a 6-minute walk test (see outcome measures). Following a 15-minute rest, participants will complete 10 x sit-to-stands.\n\nDuring the testing session where participants are not wearing the Bionic Leg, once they have finished all of the above testing, participants will engage in further testing during this session. Following a 15-minute recovery period participants will take -part in a 30-minute training session whilst wearing the Bionic Leg. The training programme will ask participants to engage in a variety of walking, balance and stair exercises. Following this, individuals will be given a further 15-min rest period, and the original tests (PCI, TUG, postural sway, 6-min walk, sit-to-stand) which were detailed above, would be re-assessed. These tests will be undertaken whilst not wearing the Bionic Leg. It is anticipated that this session will last approximately 2 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Physical Activity","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["Robotics","Walking","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"A blinded outcomes assessor will analyse all data.

A patient or therapist can programme the BL to provide motor assistance during sit-to-stand exercises, over-ground walking, and stair climbing, with either more or less robotic-assistance, as desired by the therapist. As the BL increases stability and actively engages the affected leg during functional tasks, it enables patients to undertake more repetitions of specific tasks than when not wearing a BL.","armGroupLabels":["Bionic Leg"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Baseline Control Condition Assessment","description":"Participants will complete identical tasks as that undertaken with the Bionic Leg, but will complete the tasks without wearing the Bionic Leg.","armGroupLabels":["Control"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Training","description":"Participants will take -part in a 30-minute training session whilst wearing the Bionic Leg.

The Physiological Cost Index is collected from a 3-min walking test. Prior to the test, participants remain seated for 5-mins so a resting heart rate can be recorded. It is anticipated the resting heart rate will be between 40 and 80 beats per minute. Lower heart rates are considered better than higher heart rates at rest. Thereafter, participants will walk for 3 minutes at a self-selected walking pace. Heart rate will be recorded throughout. It is anticipated that the heart rate at the end of 3 minutes will be between 80 and 120 beats per minute. Lower heart rates will be seen to be better than higher heart rates. Physiological Cost Index is calculated by (Heart rate during steady state exercise - heart rate at rest)/walking speed. The smaller change in heart rate between rest and the end of the 3 minute test, the better the Physiological Cost Index.","timeFrame":"Baseline Bionic Leg Assessment; Baseline Control Condition Assessment; Follow-up Assessment (2 hours post-baseline)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Timed-Up-and-Go between baseline and follow-up","description":"A BTS G-walk system will be used to collect Timed-Up-and-Go data.
