Aphasia treatments include speech and language therapy and pharmacologic therapy, but several studies have found that these treatments are not completely effective for patients with aphasia, leaving them with residual deficits that significantly add to the cost of stroke-related care. Additionally, the amount and frequency of speech and language therapy delivered may have a critical effect on recovery. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments or adjuncts to existing treatments, such as brain stimulation interventions, that have the potential to show greater improvements in patients with aphasia. One such new approach for non-invasive brain stimulation is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\nThis study will examine the effects of tDCS during speech therapy to further examine which method or methods is best for patient recovery. Patients enrolled in the study will undergo language testing that covers a broad range of language functions. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be completed before and after speech therapy intervention arms to investigate the neural processes affected by tDCS and speech therapy.\n\nStudy design:\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 speech therapy groups as well as randomly assigned to one of 2 stimulation groups (active anodal stimulation or sham). Patients will receive one of two different speech therapy treatment interventions to focus on specific processing deficits. Participants will undergo neuropsychological evaluation and fMRI assessment before receiving targeted anodal-tDCS or sham-tDCS for 10 therapy sessions. Participants will then be re-tested using the behavioral assessment measure and fMRI before crossing over to receive the tDCS intervention again, along with the same speech therapy arm. They will complete a behavioral assessment and fMRI at 3 months post Treatment 2 and a final behavioral assessment at 6 months post Treatment 2."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will maintain one of two speech therapy modalities throughout the study and be assigned to either targeted anodal-tDCS or sham-tDCS.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Care provider, participant, and outcome assessor are masked for tDCS status.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HD-tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be randomized to receive either anodal HD-tDCS or sham-tDCS.","interventionNames":["Device: Targeted Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]},{"label":"Speech Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be randomized to receive either phonologic-focused speech therapy or semantic-focused speech therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speech Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Targeted Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","description":"High-Definition-tDCS will be delivered via a battery-driven constant direct current stimulator (Soterix) using a 4x1 montage (1 central anodal electrode and 4 cathodal electrodes) arranged in a HD-cap.
