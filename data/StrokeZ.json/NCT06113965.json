The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Can participants self-regulate reflex excitability\n* Can participants self-regulate reflex, reduce spasticity and improve walking Participants will undergo surface stimulation to evoke spinal reflexes and will be asked to control these reflexes therefore reducing spasticity.\n\nResearchers will compare result to able bodied participants to see if \\[insert effects\\]","detailedDescription":"The study purpose is to investigate the possibility and later effect of spinal reflex self-regulation in post-stroke stiff-knee gait. The intervention will consist of direct current surface stimulation of the peripheral nerves using electrical stimulation. Stimulation will evoke a motor response that will be collected through surface EMG electrodes and processed to depict a measure of the response as feedback to the participant to complete the loop of operant conditioning. The participant will attempt to modulate their responses over multiple sessions to cause this depiction to either increase or decrease its value depending on an established target.\n\n."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Chronic Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic","Gait, Spastic","Walking, Difficulty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: Post-stroke Stiff-Knee Gait Participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Individuals with post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait","interventionNames":["Other: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Peripheral Nerve Stimulation","description":"Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves to measure resulting gait kinematics and surface muscle activity","armGroupLabels":["Experimental: Post-stroke Stiff-Knee Gait Participants"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Surface electromyographic recording of leg muscles","description":"Recording electrical activity of leg muscles during walking in response to peripheral nerve stimulation","timeFrame":"baseline, week 6 -mid-treatment, week 12 - end of treatment, 4-week post treatment, 12 weeks post treatment, 24 weeks post treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meter walk test","description":"10 meter walk test with collection of gait kinematics captured using an inertial motion capture camera system","timeFrame":"baseline, week 6 -mid-treatment, week 12 - end of treatment, 4-week post treatment, 12 weeks post treatment, 24 weeks post treatment"},{"measure":"quadriceps pendulum test","description":"This is a method of evaluating spasticity using gravity to provoke the muscular stretch reflex allowing for the collection of joint angle data.
