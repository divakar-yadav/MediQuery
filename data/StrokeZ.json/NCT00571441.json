This study will collate data that is already being collected by the bedside nurses.","detailedDescription":"Objective: To compare measurement of stroke volume variance with intake/output measurements, weight, BUN/Creatnine values, and central venous pressure.\n\nDesign: Non-experimental, non-randomized observational comparative study.\n\nSetting: The sixteen bed Neurocritical Care Unit at Duke University Hospital.\n\nPatients: 45 adult (over 18 years) subjects with intracranial pathology who require volume resuscitation. Only patients with current LiDCO monitoring will be considered eligible for inclusion in the study.\n\nInterventions: This is an observational study. Subjects will receive standard-of-care treatment without additional intervention.\n\nData Analysis: All data will be collected by the principal investigator / study coordinator. Personal patient information will be removed (deidentified) from the permanent data collection records to protect patient confidentiality. Data collected will be entered into a Microsoft Excel electronic spreadsheet and will be saved on a USB Disk drive to be stored in a locked cabinet in the investigator's office. Statistical analysis using SAS v9.1, (Cary, NC) will be conducted with a level of significance set at .05 (alpha) using standardized comparative analysis techniques."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injury","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Brain injury","nursing","Critical care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Primary","description":"All subjects are included in this group, non-randomized observational study."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke volume variation","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Admitted to the neurocritical care unit have an arterial line in place already connected to LiDCO monitor Physician order for monitoring intake and output\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnant females","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Neurologically injured patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"DaiWai Olson, PhD RN CCRN","affiliation":"Duke University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Duke University","city":"Durham","state":"North Carolina","zip":"27705","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":35.99403,"lon":-78.89862}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"15153237","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Pearse RM, Ikram K, Barry J.
