The investigators' short-term objectives are to test study hypotheses using a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) with an Attention Control (also referred to as the \"Sittercise\" exercise program). The investigators will also explore factors related to exercise adherence in a community program for chronic stroke survivors. The investigators' longer term objective is to disseminate this model to facilitate the development of a network of community-based exercise programs for older adults with chronic stroke. In the RCT the investigators propose to offer courses in Office of Aging (OoA) Senior Centers and National Rehabilitation Hospital. At the conclusion of the research study, the OoA plans to continue offering APA-stroke courses. Through partnership, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the Administration of Aging (AoA) can potentially replicate this model at the community throughout the U.S. using local OoA Senior Centers and other facilities that would increase community access for Veterans."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"APA-Stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The APA-stroke exercise program designed specifically for individuals with hemiparetic gait deficits due to stroke.

It includes 59 items and assesses 8 domains (strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation/role function). The SIS uses a 5-point Likert Scale. Summative scores for each domain range from 0-100. Total scores range from 0 to 800. A higher score reflects better function. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.","populationDescription":"SIS data were incomplete for six sittercise participants, hence the discrepancy between number of participants analyzed and the flow data reported above.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","unitOfMeasure":"units on a scale","timeFrame":"measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"APA-Stroke","description":"The APA-stroke exercise program designed specifically for individuals with hemiparetic gait deficits due to stroke.
