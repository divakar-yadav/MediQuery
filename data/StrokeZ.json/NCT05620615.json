Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly selected.Patients were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin 100 mg per day and clopidogrel 75 mg per day were administered for 90 days, followed by aspirin 100 mg per day for long term) and atorvastatin (40 mg per day for 14 days, followed by 20 mg per day long term) after enrollment. Patients with aspirin resistance (aspirin reaction units \\[ARU\\] ≥550) or clopidogrel resistance (P2Y12 reaction units \\[PRU\\] ≥208) were excluded on the 7th day of therapy.The primary objective is to observe the safety and efficacy of intensive drug therapy for ischemic stroke patients. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study.
