In the literature there are studies that relate the method to postural stabilization, joint rehabilitation, treatment of low back pain, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, studies on the modality\\&#39;s potential for improving isokinetic and antihypertensive strength are scarce, particularly in post-stroke hemiparetic individuals with high blood pressure (BP). The objective of the study is to investigate changes in isokinetic strength and BP, in addition to functional capacity, balance, autonomic modulation, blood biomarkers and endothelial function in hemiparetic individuals due to stroke sequelae and/or with high BP (prehypertensive and hypertensive), after 12 weeks of training with Mat Pilates. Eligible volunteers will be randomly divided into a Mat Pilates group with stroke (GP-AVE), Mat Pilates group with high blood pressure (HA) (GP-HA), control group with stroke (GC-AVE) and control group with HA (GC-HA ). On the first and second visit, measurements of isokinetic strength, functional capacity, static and dynamic balance, heart rate variability, cardiac output, stroke volume, endothelial function, total peripheral vascular resistance and blood biomarkers will be carried out. In addition, 24-hour BP will be measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM). GP-AVE and GP-HA will participate in a 12-week Mat Pilates program, totaling 36 training sessions lasting approximately 60 minutes, with an increasing degree of difficulty and complexity throughout the training period. GC-AVE and GC-HA will be instructed to maintain their daily activities during the intervention period, then they will be invited to participate in the Mat Pilates program. The initial measurements will be repeated at the end of the intervention in the Mat Pilates and control groups. Intra and intergroup comparisons will be carried out for all outcomes, for a significance level set at p ≤ 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","High Blood Pressure"],"keywords":["Autonomy","hemodynamic","balance","muscle strength","chronic reduction in blood pressure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"EXPANDED_ACCESS"},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mat Pilates","description":"Mat Pilates training will last 12 weeks, with three weekly trial sessions being held at 48-72h intervals. Each session will last approximately 60 minutes, including: 5 minutes of warm-up (light calisthenic exercises for the shoulder and pelvic girdles); 50 minutes of Mat Pilates exercises; 5 min back to calm.\n\nUpon arriving at the training site, volunteers will rest for 10 minutes in a sitting position, after which BP measurements will be taken and HR at rest. Throughout consecutive training sessions, participants will perform Pilates method exercises with a progressively greater degree of difficulty and complexity, following the official recommendations for prescription of resistance exercise for individuals with BP elevated and post-stroke. The exercises will be performed in single sets of 10 repetitions.
