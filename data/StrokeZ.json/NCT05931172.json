It will be randomized clinical trial.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. A stroke is defined as an abrupt neurological outburst caused by impaired perfusion through the blood vessels to the brain. Every year the number of patients affected by stroke is rising thereby putting extra pressure on socioeconomic conditions in developing countries. Major complications of stroke include hemiplegia leading to upper limb dysfunction along with gait abnormalities. This study will be conducted to determine the effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises versus dual-task training on balance, cognition, and motor function in chronic stroke patients. The randomized clinical trial will be conducted, participants will be selected through Non-probability convenience sampling technique and then randomly allocated into two treatment groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["chronic stroke","PNF","Dual task","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual tasking","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dual tasking utilizes a task-specific approach to balance training, applying repeated exposure to unpredictable mechanical perturbations that mimic balance disturbances experienced in daily life.","interventionNames":["Other: Dual tasking"]},{"label":"Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a therapeutic approach that uses cutaneous, proprioceptive and auditory input to produce functional improvement in motor output.","interventionNames":["Other: PNF(proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Dual tasking","description":"Dual-task training is an emerging task-specific intervention that aims to improve reactive balance control after destabilizing perturbations in a safe and controlled environment.
