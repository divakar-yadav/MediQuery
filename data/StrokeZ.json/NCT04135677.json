The contemporary strategy for post-implantation antithrombotic medication therapy derived from several initial industrialized authoritative researches, demonstrated as 45 days for anticoagulation and prolonged DOAC for 6 months. In spite of the increasing experience of operators and arrival of new technologies, the rates of DRT still maintained. Therefore, whether altered medication therapy post-implantation attracted overwide attention. Nowadays, new oral anticoagulation such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran has evolved empirically and successively has been applied for days-weeks anticoagulation therapy following LAAO ,yet, the specific recommended dosage remained unclear.\n\nTherefore, the objective of the study is to compare the effects of different dosage of rivaroxaban for short-term(12 weeks) anticoagulation therapy versus DAPT for post-LAAO anti-thrombotic therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Left Atrial Appendage
