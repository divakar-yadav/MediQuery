The primary outcome was 90-day functional independence rate (mRS score ≤2) in all patients included(including EVT patient and medication patients).Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and 90-day mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery Sequence Vascular Hyperintensity-diffusion-weighted Imaging Mismatch(FVH-DWI Mismatch)","Image Evaluation","Endovascular Thrombectomy"],"keywords":["FVH-DWI mismatch;Endovascular Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":309,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MRI group","description":"MRI Images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany).Image sequences and typical parameter ranges were diffusion tensor imaging (repetition time \\[TR\\], 5200ms; echo time \\[TE\\], 80 ms; 4mm slice thickness; 40 slices) by using SE-EPI sequence; T1 imaging (TR, 240 ms; TE, 2.47 ms; 5 mm slice thickness; 17 slices) by using SE sequence;T2 imaging (TR, 4480 ms; TE, 99 ms; 4 mm slice thickness; 24 slices) by using FSE sequence; FLAIR imaging (TR, 8500 ms; TE, 95 ms; 5 mm slice thickness; 21 slices) by using IR sequence; time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images (TR, 20 ms; TE, 3 ms; 0.55 mm slice thickness; 40 slices) by using 3D-TOF sequence;\n\nIn the MRI group, patients with FVH-DWI mismatch were considered to have EVT indications and were treated with EVT, while patients without FVH-DWI mismatch were treated with medication.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Surgical criteria"]},{"label":"Perfusion group","description":"The protocol of CT Perfusion was as follows: 100 mm coverage in the z-axis, tube voltage, 80 kV; tube current, 120 mA; section thickness, 5 mm.
