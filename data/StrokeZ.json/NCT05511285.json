Rehabilitation of movement after stroke depends on motor learning. Motor learning involves not only improvement during practice but also offline improvement, or consolidation, that occurs after practice. Consolidation of learning depends on good sleep quality. However, sleep is disrupted long-term after stroke and patients with poorer sleep show worse rehabilitation outcomes.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT) is the recommended first line treatment for sleep problems. \"Sleepio\" is a digital CBT programme which is effective across a range of clinical populations. This study aims to test the efficacy of digital CBT for reducing insomnia symptoms after stroke, in comparison with usual care alone. To explore the possibility that sleep interventions might enhance rehabilitation outcomes via their impact on consolidation of motor learning, the study will additionally test for differences in consolidation between groups, and explore whether changes in sleep measures are associated with changes in consolidation.\n\nParticipants will be randomised to either receive digital CBT for insomnia (in addition to usual care) or receive treatment as usual alone (2:1 treatment to control ratio). The primary outcome is the score on the 8-item Sleep Condition Indicator, 10 weeks following randomisation. Secondary outcomes include behavioural measures of overnight motor consolidation assessed as the change in motor task performance from training to retest, sleep disruption assessed with actigraphy, and depression and fatigue using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and the Fatigue Severity Scale respectively.\n\nIn addition to this, to explore the feasibility of delivering rehabilitation following the sleep improvement programme, an optional 4 weeks of upper limb motor training at home will be offered to all participants (regardless of group allocation) after follow-up. Outcomes of adherence to the training and upper limb function will be assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Sleep","Rehabilitation","Digital","Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia","Motor consolidation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomised controlled trial with two parallel study arms: (1) digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (experimental condition), and (2) treatment as usual (control condition).
