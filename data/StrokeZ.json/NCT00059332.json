Each year, more than 750,000 Americans suffer a symptomatic stroke.\n\nCurrently, tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke; however, its usefulness is limited because most patients cannot reach medical attention within the necessary 3-hour time window. In addition, rt-PA cannot be given in the field because it is contraindicated for treatment of patients with brain hemorrhage.\n\nThe purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial is to demonstrate that paramedic initiation of the neuroprotective agent magnesium sulfate in the field is an effective and safe treatment for acute stroke. This study will analyze magnesium sulfate, an experimental therapy for stroke, versus placebo among ambulance-transported patients with acute stroke. This trial will also demonstrate that paramedics can safely, effectively, and rapidly start neuroprotective therapies for stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["stroke","brain attack","magnesium sulfate","neuroprotection","prehospital care","emergency medical services"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1700,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Magnesium Sulfate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Magnesium sulfate (Mg) was administered intravenously with a 15 minute bolus load followed by a 24 hour infusion.
