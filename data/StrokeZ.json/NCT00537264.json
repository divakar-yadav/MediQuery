The administration of health-related quality of life questionnaires is the intervention being studied. Health-related quality of life questionnaires measure the physical, mental and social well-being of an individual, are recognised as important patient-reported outcomes and are increasingly being used in clinical trials and routine clinical practice. By asking study participants to complete a questionnaire assessing their physical, mental and social well-being, we are increasing their awareness of these aspects of their health and may directly or indirectly prompt them to take actions and/ or have thoughts that may improve or worsen their health status. Hence, we have considered this an interventional study. This survey will be conducted in Chinese."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Heart Disease","Hypertension","Stroke"],"keywords":["health-related quality of life","primary care","computer-assisted instruction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4800,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Computer","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Health-related quality of life questionnaires will be administered using a computerised multimedia touchscreen system.","interventionNames":["Other: Health-related quality of life assessment"]},{"label":"Interviewer","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Health-related quality of life questionnaire will be administered via face-to-face interviews.","interventionNames":["Other: Health-related quality of life assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Health-related quality of life assessment","description":"Study participants will be asked to complete the following health-related quality of life questionnaires: EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index 3, SF-8 and SF-6D.
