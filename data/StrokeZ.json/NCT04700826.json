The trial will test the hypothesis that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), now commonly used in older patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), are effective and cost-effective at reducing major adverse clinical events in younger patients at low or intermediate risk of stroke, and can reduce the high rate of cognitive decline. The health technology innovations noted above will allow the investigators to answer this important clinical question, as well as demonstrate the capacity and potential of this system for future, large-scale healthcare-embedded clinical trials for patient benefit.","detailedDescription":"Designed with a Patient and Public Involvement Team, DaRe2THINK is an individual-patient, open-label, event-driven randomised trial with 1:1 allocation to DOAC or no additional therapy (usual care). Automated screening will occur of over 12 million patients in England, with targeted recruitment to practices with eligible patients, regular updates to General Practitioners, simple processes for centre inclusion and patient randomisation, remote e-consent and no additional visits for any patient. The primary outcome is a comprehensive composite of any thromboembolic event, ascertained entirely using electronic healthcare records within both primary and secondary NHS care across the nation. All endpoint data will follow a pre-published coding manual for extracted electronic healthcare data. The key secondary outcome is the change in patient-reported cognitive function, using remote technology solutions to save time for clinical staff and patients. DaRe2THINK will carefully assess and validate safety outcomes relating to major and minor bleeding. A systematic health economic analysis will determine NHS and societal cost-effectiveness of DOAC therapy in this younger population of patients with AF. DaRe2THINK will initially run over a 5-year period (outcomes as listed below), with longer-term outcomes (in particular cardiovascular death, cognitive function and vascular dementia) reassessed at 10 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","anticoagulation","stroke","dementia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Individual patient, open-label, event driven RCT with 1:1 allocation to DOAC or no additional therapy (usual care).
