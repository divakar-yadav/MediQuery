Patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravascular thrombolytic therapy, mechanical thrombolysis, angioplasty and so on were treated with Eptifibatide injection on the first day, followed by the second day, the third day, the discharge day and the 90 days.","detailedDescription":"The study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial.A total of 220 patients (Age≥18years) with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravascular thrombolysis, mechanical thrombolysis, angioplasty, etc., were treated with Eptifibatide, providing informed consent and medication.The recommended dose of this study was: first, 135ug / kg was injected intravenously or intraductal (within 5 minutes), followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 0.75 ug / kg / min for 24 h. In special cases, it is up to the operator to decide whether to reinject or increase the dosage according to experience. The maximum dose for the first time was 180ug / kg, if necessary, with a 10-minute interval of intravenously or intraductal injection, and a maximum dose of 180ug / kg, intravenously / intraductal injection of no more than 360ug / kg. Continuous intravenous infusion does not exceed 2ug/kg/ Min. Then the second day, the third day, the discharge and 90 days visit. Follow-up information included vital signs and physical examination, observation of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, NIHSS scale, and recording of current drug use by AE,SAE.The trial is anticipated to last from January 2019 to December 2019 with 220 subjects recruited form 15 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese GCP standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Eptifibatide","Endovascular Treatment","Recovery of Dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Eptifibatide Drug: Eptifibatide Injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Eptifibatide Injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Eptifibatide Injection","description":"Recommendation: first, intravenously or intraductal injection of 135ug / kg (completed in 5 minutes), followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 0.75ug / kg / min for 24 hours.","armGroupLabels":["Eptifibatide Drug: Eptifibatide Injection"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Incidence of symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage within 48 hours after treatment","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage type (PH1) and (PH2)","description":"The incidence of cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage type (PH1) and (PH2) for 48 hours of treatment","timeFrame":"48 hours"},{"measure":"Serious adverse events","description":"Proportion of serious adverse events occurring within 48 hours of treatment","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours"},{"measure":"Total death rate","description":"Total death rate within 48 hours of treatment","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours"},{"measure":"Adverse events","description":"Proportion of adverse events within 48 hours of treatment","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours"},{"measure":"Serious adverse events","description":"Proportion of serious adverse events within 90 days of treatment","timeFrame":"Within 90 days"},{"measure":"Total death rate","description":"Total death rate within 90 days of treatment","timeFrame":"Within 90 days"},{"measure":"Adverse events","description":"Proportion of adverse events treated within 90 days","timeFrame":"Within 90 days"},{"measure":"Vascular recanalization","description":"Proportion of vascular recanalization at the first 24 hours during the therapy","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Favorable clinical outcomes","description":"Proportion of patients achieve favorable clinical outcomes (mRS 0-2) after 90 days of treatment","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Neurological recovery","description":"The recovery of neurological deficits assessed by the difference of the 90 days NIHSS to the baseline NIHSS","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Recurrent ischemic stroke","description":"Proportion of recurrent ischemic stroke after 90 days of treatment","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Combined vascular events","description":"Proportion of combined vascular events (recurrent ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death) at 90 days of treatment","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
