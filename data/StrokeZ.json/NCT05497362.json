For the treatment group, an anodal high-definition tDCS of 2 milliampere (mA) lasting for 15 minutes was delivered to the primary motor cortex (SM1) in 10 daily sessions during a 2-week period. For the sham tDCS group, the same setting of tDCS electrodes was applied on the scalp, but the stimulation only lasted for 30 sec in order to cause similar sensation on the scalp as the other group. Simultaneous to the tDCS stimulation, both groups will receive speech and voice therapy for 30 minutes.\n\nAn array of outcome measures reflecting speech production ability including acoustic, kinematic, perceptual and self-perceptual qualities was obtained before and after stimulation. It was anticipated that post-stroke dysarthric patients will see improvement in speech production after stimulation. The results provided important insights into the effects of tDCS on articulatory movement in individuals with dysarthria post-stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysarthria","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Double-blinded","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group 1 (n = 5) received anodal tDCS stimulation and intensive speech and voice therapy; tDCS and speech therapy was applied in 10 daily sessions during a 2-week period, administered on Monday to Friday.

A professional grade microphone (SM58, Shure, USA) was used to record the speech production. Experienced speech-language pathologists blinded to the neurological condition and history of each participant analyzed the speech samples independently using a perceptual rating scale including 21 speech dimensions covering eight categories, including pitch, loudness, voice quality, resonance, rate, articulation, tone, and general impression. The speech samples were rated using a seven-point equal-appearing interval scale, with a \"1\" indicating within typical limit performance and a \"7\" severely deviated from the normal.","timeFrame":"Change before and after tDCS stimulation at immediately post-treatment"},{"measure":"Acoustic measurement: Fundamental frequency (F0)","description":"Fundamental frequency (F0) was obtained from sustained vowel phonation.","timeFrame":"Change before and after tDCS stimulation at immediately post-treatment"},{"measure":"Acoustic measurement: Frequency perturbation (jitter %)","description":"Frequency perturbation (jitter %) was obtained from sustained vowel phonation.","timeFrame":"Change before and after tDCS stimulation at immediately post-treatment"},{"measure":"Acoustic measurement: Intensity perturbation (shimmer %)","description":"Intensity perturbation (shimmer %) was obtained from sustained vowel phonation.","timeFrame":"Change before and after tDCS stimulation at immediately post-treatment"},{"measure":"Acoustic measurement: Noise to harmonic ratio (NHR)","description":"Noise to harmonic ratio (NHR) was obtained from sustained vowel phonation.","timeFrame":"Change before and after tDCS stimulation at immediately post-treatment"},{"measure":"Acoustic measurement: Harmonic to noise ratio (HNR)","description":"Harmonic to noise ratio (HNR) was obtained from sustained vowel phonation.","timeFrame":"Change before and after tDCS stimulation at immediately post-treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Kinematic measurement: Duration","description":"The lip and tongue function during speech production were traced real time and objectively measured using an electromagnetic articulography.
