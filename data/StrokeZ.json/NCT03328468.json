The experimental sessions were randomized between the slow-breathing condition (6 breaths/min) or the control breathing condition (12 breaths/min). Breathing interventions were 15 minutes in length and completed with the assistance of the breathing app, Breathe Deep (Mineev, Bizi Apps LLC).\n\nThe breathing intervention is currently completed.\n\nThe reliability and validity study of AFAS is ongoing. This is a one-time visit for participants in which participants will undergo screening of sensation and movement as well as fill in some questionnaires.","detailedDescription":"All participants had two visits for the breathing exercise. The only planned intervention was the breathing exercise, which is now concluded.\n\nThe protocol for the breathing intervention was as follows: The breathing protocol lasted 15 minutes. It was a guided breathing awareness session with a registered nurse (PhD student) who is also trained in integrative therapies and yoga instruction.\n\nIn parallel, during one of the visits the reliability and validity of a new scale for stroke to measure quality of movement and body awareness is tested.\n\nThis part is still ongoing and thus this becomes a one-time visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Breathing Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Breathing Exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Breathing Exercise","description":"Breathing exercise for stroke patients","armGroupLabels":["Breathing Exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reliability of a new scale for stroke: Awareness of Functional Tasks with Arm and Hand in Stroke (AFAS scale)","description":"AFAS contains 13 items","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Validity a new motor scale for upper extremity Upper Limb Motor Scale in people with stroke (AFAS scale","description":"Scale using 0-45 for measurement, 0 being low and 45 being high.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Evaluation Scale for Upper Extremity in Stroke Patients (MESUPES)","description":"Scale using 0-58 for measurement, 0 being low and 58 being high.
