At the 1st visit, the patient will provide consent, a complete list of medications, a complete pre-study questionnaire, a copy of their insurance card, and a buccal swab (collected by the pharmacist). The swab will be sent to the testing facility for genotypic testing of CYP2C19. Upon receipt of the results of the results, the pharmacist will propose an intervention to the prescriber based on the patient's indication for clopidogrel and the identification of certain genetic variations atCYP2C19. All patients will be asked to return to the pharmacy for explanation of the results and implementation of any changes approved by the prescriber and to complete a follow-up questionnaire. After the visit to explain the results of testing, the patient's insurance will be billed electronically for a medication therapy management visit; patients without insurance will not be billed. Patients may opt out of billing to insurance at any time.","otherNames":["Personalized medicine","Pharmacogenetics"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of Pharmacogenomics testing in a Community pharmacy","description":"Change in patient perception of testing, reimbursement for pharmacist time, provider acceptance, and amount of pharmacist time required will be measured as part of the provision of this service.","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prescribed clopidogrel (Plavix) by their prescriber\n* Aged 18 or older\n* Currently on clopidogrel therapy for one of the following indicated uses: post-ACS, Recent PCI with stenting, History of TIA or stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Are unable to complete study materials (surveys) with or without assistance, including non-English speaking patients\n* Are taking clopidogrel for a reason other than stated in inclusion criteria\n* Are pregnant or nursing\n* Have an allergy to aspirin","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Stefanie Ferreri, PharmD","affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kerr Drug","city":"Chapel Hill","state":"North Carolina","zip":"27517","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":35.9132,"lon":-79.05584}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"},{"id":"D000009203","term":"Myocardial Infarction"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","asFound":"Myocardial Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000077144","term":"Clopidogrel"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010975","term":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000058921","term":"Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists"},{"id":"D000058919","term":"Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists"},{"id":"D000058914","term":"Purinergic Antagonists"},{"id":"D000058905","term":"Purinergic Agents"},{"id":"D000018377","term":"Neurotransmitter Agents"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M1669","name":"Clopidogrel","asFound":"Results","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13555","name":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M28984","name":"Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20194","name":"Neurotransmitter Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"PlAggInh","name":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
