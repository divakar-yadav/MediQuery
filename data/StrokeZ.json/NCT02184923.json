In healthy human subjects verticality perception is accurate while upright.The strategy of this research is to quantify changes in verticality perception after unilateral lesions along the central graviceptive pathways and to assess the frequency and pattern of abnormal verticality perception in patients with acute stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Our underlying hypothesis is that screening for erroneous verticality perception by use of a mobile device assessing the subjective visual vertical (SVV) during the acute phase (i.e., within 24-48 hours after symptom onset) reliably identifies those patients with defects. Early detection of deficits in verticality perception may help to initiate balance physiotherapy early."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Verticality Perception in Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":130,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"verticality measurements","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: presentation of visual vertical"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"presentation of visual vertical","armGroupLabels":["verticality measurements"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of verticality perception","timeFrame":"during the measurement period (10 minutes)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Test-re-test reliability of verticality perception","timeFrame":"from session 1 (day 0) to session 2 (day 1)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. ages 18-90 years\n2. informed consent\n3. for group 1: acute (i.e. symptom onset \\<3 days ago) lateralized ischemia or hemorrhage as confirmed by clinical examination and / or brain imaging (CT or MRI).\n4. absence of exclusion criteria\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. history of a peripheral-vestibular deficit\n2. disturbed consciousness\n3. severe sensory or motor aphasia\n4. visual field deficits\n5. other neurological or systemic disorder which can cause dementia or cognitive dysfunction\n6. intake of antidepressants, sedatives, or neuroleptics","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Dominik Straumann, MD","affiliation":"University Hospital Zurich, Division of Neurology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Zurich","city":"Zurich","state":"ZH","zip":"8091","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.36667,"lon":8.54999}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19433743","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Zwergal A, Rettinger N, Frenzel C, Dieterich M, Brandt T, Strupp M.
