Inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere has emerged as a potential intervention to enhance effects of other rehabilitation strategies on improvement of motor performance of the paretic upper limb. In this proof-of-concept study we will evaluate the effects of inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere associated with robotic therapy on improvement of motor performance of the paretic upper limb in the early phase post-stroke.","detailedDescription":"The main goal of this study is to test the proof of concept of benefits of inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere on learning evaluated by improvement in kinematics of motor performance, in patients with upper limb paresis in the early phase post-stroke. For this purpose, patients will be randomized to receive real or sham transcranial direct current stimulation before a session of robotic therapy. Data will be collected by kinematic assessment performed automatically by the robot at baseline, immediately after and 24h after the intervention.\n\nThe working hypothesis is that one session of upper limb motor training will lead to improvement of performance in metrics of kinematics, and this improvement will be maintained up to 24h after the end of the training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","robotic therapy","transcranial direct current stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active stimulation + robotic therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Active transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied during 20 minutes prior to robotic training.\n\nNumber of interventions sessions: 1","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic Therapy","Device: Active stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation + robotic therapy","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied during 20 minutes prior to robotic training.\n\nNumber of interventions sessions: 1","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic Therapy","Device: Sham stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic Therapy","description":"Robotic therapy (MIT - Manus, Interactive Motion Technologies) will be administered for 40 minutes to the paretic upper limb.","armGroupLabels":["Active stimulation + robotic therapy","Sham stimulation + robotic therapy"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active stimulation","description":"Active transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied with the cathode positioned over the ipsilesional primary motor cortex and the anode over the contralateral supraorbital region for 20 minutes (1mA).","armGroupLabels":["Active stimulation + robotic therapy"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham stimulation","description":"In sham transcranial direct current stimulation, no current will be delivered through the transcranial direct current stimulation device after the first 30 seconds.","armGroupLabels":["Sham stimulation + robotic therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Movement Smoothness","description":"The speed shape, calculated as mean speed divided by peak speed.","timeFrame":"Kinematic assessment at baseline, immediately after intervention;
