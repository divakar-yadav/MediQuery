The NP only program will provide a 30 day intervention while the NP/HC team will provide 3 months of support via in-home and telephone encounters for patients randomized to one of these groups. In the first 30 days post-enrollment the NP will focus on medical case management and coordination with primary care providers and specialists, provide self-management coaching, and intervene if gaps in care are identified - all with a focus on BP reduction and preparing the patient for ongoing BP maintenance. As applicable, the HC will pick up the case after 30 days and follow up with the plan of care jointly established by the patient, NP and HC. The focus will be on ongoing self-management coaching, providing preparation support for physician visits, and linking patient to additional community resources, as needed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["stroke","transient ischemic attack","High blood pressure","Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":495,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual Home Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Regardless of study arm, all patients will receive usual home health services: a physician-ordered plan of care; skilled nursing and/or therapy services as prescribed by the MD; patient education, monitoring and hands-on care; and home health aide services depending on functional deficits and availability of unpaid caregivers."},{"label":"Nurse Practitioner + Health Coach","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The NP + HC arm will include the same protocol as the NP only arm plus 30 additional days of support.
