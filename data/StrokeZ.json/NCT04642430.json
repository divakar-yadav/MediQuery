Having a stroke can affect a patient's ability to speak, eat, walk, work, care for themselves, and interact with others. Not only can it ruin one's life, but it can also be fatal. A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a clot, depriving brain cells of oxygen. In people with atrial fibrillation, blood flow is sluggish in the top chambers of the heart, and blood clots can form there. When a piece of a clot breaks off, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. That's where blood thinners come in. Blood thinners, or anticoagulants, decrease the chances of blood clots forming in the heart, reducing the risk of stroke. Studies show that blood thinners are highly effective at reducing the risk of stroke by up to 95%.\n\nThe conventional blood thinner is warfarin, taken by mouth. Warfarin requires regular blood tests to make sure a patient getting the correct dose. The patient also may have to avoid certain foods since the medication can interact with them. Newer blood thinners, known as direct-oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are available, which do not require regular blood tests and do not interact with foods. Two of the new blood thinners are called rivaroxaban and apixaban. Like warfarin, they can be taken by mouth, and studies have shown them to be as effective as warfarin.\n\nBoth rivaroxaban and apixaban have been approved for stroke prevention in AF by Health Canada. However, there have been no direct head-to-head comparisons of these two anticoagulants, meaning comparative safety data is not available. Increasing use of DOACs for stroke prevention in AF and patient values around bleeding highlight the need for a comparison trial to ensure patients receive the anticoagulant with the greatest balance of benefit to potential harm.\n\nThe trial is to assess bleeding rates and superiority of using apixaban versus rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.","detailedDescription":"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) affects 200,000 Canadians and increases risk of stroke, morbidity and mortality. Oral anticoagulants such as Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are highly effective at reducing the risk of stroke by up to 95%. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared apixaban and rivaroxaban (both DOACs) to VKAs for stroke prevention in AF, and are approved for this use by Health Canada. However, there have been no direct head-to-head comparisons of these two anticoagulants, meaning comparative safety data is not available. Increasing use of DOACs for stroke prevention in AF, patient values around bleeding, and litigation highlight the need for a comparison trial to ensure patients receive the anticoagulant with the greatest balance of benefit to potential harm.\n\nThe objective of this RCT is to compare the safety of the first 12 months of apixaban twice daily to rivaroxaban once daily in patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF). Patients will be monitored for the primary outcome of clinically relevant bleeding (CRB; a composite of major bleeding (MB) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events during follow-up. This trial will directly inform clinical practice and the choice of first-line therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Stroke Prevention","Bleed"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A pragmatic prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3018,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Apixaban group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"5 mg PO, twice daily for 12 months of treatment.
