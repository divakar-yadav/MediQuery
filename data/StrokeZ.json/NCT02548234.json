Brain imaging research using magnetoencephalography found that mirror therapy combined with bilateral arm training could potentially aid stroke rehabilitation by normalizing an asymmetrical pattern of movement-related beta desynchronization in primary motor cortex. However, different neural mechanisms may cause different effect of motor control recovery after the two different approaches, which have yet to be studied. Study purposeï¼šTo compare the efficacy of mirror therapy and bilateral arm training on movement strategies of the affected upper extremity and functional outcome in chronic stroke patients. Study method: This was a single-blind, randomized, comparative efficacy research. Sixty participants with chronic stroke will be recruited in the occupational therapy clinics at four hospitals and randomly assigned to the mirror therapy and bilateral arm training groups. The intervention will consist of 1.5 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 4 wks, including 3 days of hospital-based therapy and 5 days of home practice. Primary outcomes were muscular properties (grip strength) and sensorimotor measurements. Secondary outcomes included measures of daily functions to gain insight about movement capabilities. The validity and reliability of all measurements have been proposed. Finally, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Fisher exact test will be used to compare the significant differences between the two approaches. The effect size of dependent variables will be reported also."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Randomized control trial","Mirror therapy","Bilateral arm training","Comparative efficacy research","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mirror therapy group received training for 1.5 hours/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks and home programs for 30-40 min/day, 5 days/week.","interventionNames":["Other: Mirror therapy"]},{"label":"Bilateral arm training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Bilateral arm training group received training for 1.5 hours/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks and home programs for 30-40 min/day, 5 days/week.","interventionNames":["Other: Bilateral arm training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mirror therapy","description":"Mirror therapy group received training for 1.5 hours/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks and home programs for 30-40 min/day, 5 days/week.","armGroupLabels":["Mirror therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bilateral arm training","description":"Bilateral arm training group received training for 1.5 hours/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks and home programs for 30-40 min/day, 5 days/week.","armGroupLabels":["Bilateral arm training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The efficacy of mirror therapy versus bilateral arm training on sensorimotor functions","description":"Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment and Fugl-Meyer Assessment will be used to measure sensorimotor functions.
