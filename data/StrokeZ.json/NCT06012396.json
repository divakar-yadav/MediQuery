However, stroke patients have shown a passive attitude in participating in physical education or exercise programs for life, and the local community lacked appropriate guidelines or experience in guiding exercise and physical education for stroke patients, so they had a burden on instructing exercise. In this study, an appropriate complex exercise program was established for patients after discharge through analysis of domestic and foreign research data to provide an environment and opportunity to exercise in the community, and based on the results, stroke patients actively exercise in the community in the future. The goal is to provide a basis for doing so."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"rct","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Stoke complex exercise program"]},{"label":"Daily life group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Stoke complex exercise program","description":"1. warm-up(5min) flexibility exercise - neck, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, forearm, back, quadriceps, biceps femoris, ankle\n2. main exercise(40min) aerobic exercise(20min)- use stepper, treadmill, high intensity HRR60%, RPE 11\\~14 low intensity HRR30%, RPE 9\\~11 repeated interval training strength and balance exercises(20min)- program1. upper(shoulder press, chest press, biceps curl), lower(hip flexion, knee extension), Core(plank exercise, sit up) program2. upper(seated back row, triceps extension), lower(hip extension, hip abduction, knee flexion, Core(superman exercise, bridge exercise) repeated ever other day program1, program2 clean-up(5min) - same as warm-up","armGroupLabels":["Exercise group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6WMT","description":"6-minute walk test practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians","timeFrame":"Baseline and Follow-up evaluation (through study completion, an average of 6 weeks)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MRS","description":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.","timeFrame":"Baseline and Follow-up evaluation (through study completion, an average of 6 weeks)"},{"measure":"BBS","description":"Berg balance scale (0-56, the higher the better) Objectively determine a patient's ability to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks","timeFrame":"Baseline and Follow-up evaluation (through study completion, an average of 6 weeks)"},{"measure":"FAC","description":"Functional ambulation category (0-5, the higher the better) 6-point functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability","timeFrame":"visit 1, visit 23"},{"measure":"MMT","description":"Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) is a technique used in physical therapy and rehabilitation to assess the strength and function of individual muscles or muscle groups.
