The study will also investigate when FAST is used, does it increase the identification of stroke? And if other factors can be identified as \"markers\" for more effective identification of stroke during the emergency call.","detailedDescription":"Transcribed alarm calls are read through and analyzed using a qualitative method. Meaningful units are identified, coded and categorized. A phenomenological analysis is also applied to a separate analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":179,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency of stroke symptoms","description":"A data collection tool assessing the frequency of stroke symptoms will be developed.
