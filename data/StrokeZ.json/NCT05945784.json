By examining various factors such as packaging design, product applicators, and ease of use, this research aims to identify barriers faced by individuals with upper extremity disabilities or visual deficits when using beauty products. The study seeks to provide insights and recommendations for improving the accessibility of beauty products, ultimately promoting inclusivity and enhancing the overall beauty experience for individuals with disabilities.","detailedDescription":"Individuals with upper extremity disabilities face unique challenges when it comes to using beauty products. These disabilities can include conditions such as limb loss, limited mobility, or dexterity impairments, which can significantly impact their ability to engage in self-care and beauty routines. The accessibility of beauty products is crucial to ensure that individuals with upper extremity disabilities have equal opportunities to participate in activities that promote self-expression and confidence.\n\nResearch in the field of accessible design has highlighted the importance of inclusive product development across various industries, including cosmetics and personal care. However, limited attention has been given specifically to beauty products and their usability for individuals with upper extremity disabilities.\n\nTo address this gap, studies are being conducted to assess the accessibility of beauty products and identify potential barriers and solutions. These studies typically examine factors such as packaging design, ergonomics of product applicators, ease of grip, and maneuverability. By understanding the specific challenges faced by individuals with upper extremity disabilities, researchers can propose modifications and design considerations that enhance accessibility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke (CVA) or TIA","Stroke, Acute","Traumatic Brain Injury","SCI - Spinal Cord Injury","Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS)","Lupus Erythematosus","Guillain-Barre Syndrome","Multiple Sclerosis","Myasthenia Gravis","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Graves Disease","Muscular Dystrophies"],"keywords":["upper extremity disabilities","limited mobility","dexterity impairments","muscle weakness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Minimal to moderate upper extremity deficits","description":"* Individuals aged 18 years to 55 years.\n* Minimal to moderate upper extremity deficits, including but not limited to limited mobility or dexterity impairments.\n* Regular users of beauty products.\n* Able to understand and communicate in the language of the study.","interventionNames":["Other: Use of Rare Beauty makeup products"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Use of Rare Beauty makeup products","description":"Participants will be provided with a selection of beauty products items including foundation, concealer, blush, highlighter, and lipstick, specifically chosen for their potential accessibility features.
