It is a fact that the physical activity levels of individuals decrease significantly after stroke. However, there is no study examining to what extent the physical activity is affected and the factors related to the decrease in the level of physical activity. The primary aim of stroke rehabilitation is to recognize and prevent complications, to minimize disturbances, to maximize functions. Secondary objectives; to prevent stroke recurrence. Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, stroke severity and other consequences. The risk of a reduction in physical capacity occurs over time and it is assumed that normal physical activity can prevent recurrent stroke. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously assess physical activity levels after stroke. In order to increase physical activity levels, it is important to identify people with low levels of physical activity and to understand the factors that may be associated. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis by including most of the factors that may be related to physical activity in patients with stroke. In this study, unlike previous studies on physical activity in stroke, the relationships between physical activity and factors such as motor function, quality of life and cognitive skills as well as balance measurements and walking speed parameters which will be obtained from computerised posturography will be examined. In previous studies Physical Activity Scale for Elderly (PASE) questionnaire or the accelerometer device are used for the measurement of physical activity level. In this study, both of these tools will be used and the correlation between these two assessment tools will be demonstrated. In this study, patients with stroke will be evaluated by using PASE scale and accelerometer results (accelerometer will be held from Monday to Friday) for physical activity and Mini Mental test for cognitive function, Fugl Meyer Scale for motor function, Berg Balance Test and computerized posturography analysis for balance, Barthel Index for daily activities, Stroke Impact Scale for quality of life, Brunnstrom stage for motor recovery status. Each of the tests lasts about 5-10 minutes. Healthy control group will also be assessed via accelerometer and PASE questionnaire for physical activity and computerized posturography for balance.\n\nWith this study, physical activity which is protective for recurrent stroke, will be evaluated comprehensively and factors associated with physical activity will be revealed. Thus, in order to increase the physical activity, it will be concluded which factor should be treated or evaluated, and these results will be very helpful for further studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","physical
