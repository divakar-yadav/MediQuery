In order to determine this, a double blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled study design was chosen.","detailedDescription":"Patients are recruited from the Stroke Unit of the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich within seven days of stroke onset. Recruited patients are then randomly assigned to either the Control or Treatment group and subsequently take the commercially available probiotic, or the placebo, twice a day for 3 months. At this point, study participants present themselves for routine clinical examination at the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD). During these examinations, blood and stool samples are collected for metabolomic and metagenomic analysis. Additionally, questionnaires concerning cognitive function (MOCA), depression (BDI) and general gastrointestinal status (GSRS-IBS) are completed.\n\nClinical data from both acute admission and three month follow-up are also collected for the purposes of this study.\n\nFurthermore, members of the same household as the study participants are asked to donate a stool sample. These samples will be used to create a reference cohort for a paired matching approach with the Treatment and Control groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Dysbiosis"],"keywords":["Gut-Brain Axis","Probiotics","Food supplements","Microbiome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":157,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OMNi-BiOTiC SR-9","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment is taken twice a day for 3 months","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: OMNi-BiOTiC SR-9"]},{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo is taken twice a day for 3 months","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"OMNi-BiOTiC SR-9","description":"The Probiotic contains the following ingredients:\n\nMaize Starch, Maltodextrin, Inulin, Potassium Chloride, Hydrolysed rice protein, Magnesium Sulphate, Fructooligosaccharides, Amylase, Manganese Sulphate\n\nAdditionally, the following bacterial strains are included:\n\nLactobacillus Casei W56, Lactobacillus Acidophilus W22, Lactobacillus Paracasei W20, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus salivarius W24, Lactococcus lactis W19, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23","armGroupLabels":["OMNi-BiOTiC SR-9"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Placebo","description":"The Placebo contains no bacterial strains, only the prebiotic ingredients found in OMNi-BiOTiC SR-9.","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Alpha diversity, determined via Shannon index","timeFrame":"3 Months after stroke onset/Begin of diet supplementation"},{"measure":"Alpha diversity, determined via phylogenetic diversity index","timeFrame":"3 Months after stroke onset/Begin of diet supplementation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)","description":"Range of achievable values is 0 -
