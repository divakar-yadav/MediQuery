The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. The control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. Two groups will be followed up for 90 days to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning for patients of acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular thrombectomy due to large vessel occlusion of anterior circulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":498,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC+Standard medical treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"RIC+Standard medical treatment Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is induced by 4 cycles of 5 min of healthy upper limb ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion.
