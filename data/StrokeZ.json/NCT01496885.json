If the participant had an expressive aphasia and was unable to qualify based on the MMSE, the participant may have been evaluated with a language-modified form of the MMSE1 in conjunction with the investigator's clinical assessment that the participant was cognitively able to complete study procedures and stroke scales to determine eligibility. If the aphasia was too severe for the participant to complete the language-modified MMSE, the participant was excluded.\n* Participants had to have a total score between 20 and 85, inclusive, on the S-STREAM administered between 24 and 48 hours after stroke onset\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of previous stroke; uncontrolled severe hypertension; dementia; advanced Parkinson disease or other significant movement disorders; or other clinically significant diseases which, in the opinion of the investigator, would have jeopardized the safety of the participant or impacted the validity of the study results\n* Development of hemodynamic instability following the stroke as manifested by a persistent post stroke systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg (or was dependent on medications to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg) or greater than 190 mm Hg at the time of screening\n* Presence of significant global or receptive aphasia that would have interfered with the participant's ability to understand and comply with study procedures or complete stroke assessments\n* Abnormal clinical laboratory values on routine clinical laboratory test values at screening including alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal, serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL, or hemoglobin less than or equal to 10 g/dL, or any other laboratory investigation deemed by the investigator to be indicative of a clinically significant illness that could have prevented the participant from complying with study procedures or impacted on the outcome of the stroke scales\n* History of drug or alcohol abuse\n* History of any surgery or presence of any medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, may have affected the validity of the study results\n* Current participation in another clinical study involving administration of an investigational product

Limb movements are scored on a 3-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a 4-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). All S-STREAM scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 via Rasch transformation since the S-STREAM has been shown to fit the requirements of the Rasch model. The raw scores were Rasch transformed to get the logits scores and then remapped from the logit score to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates worst outcome and 100 indicate best outcome.\n\nThe mean change from baseline in S-STREAM Rasch-transformed score is being reported; higher S-STREAM scores indicate better outcomes.","populationDescription":"Subgroup analysis of Total Simplified-STroke

Components include level of consciousness (3 evaluations, 2 of which are scored 0 to 2 and 1 of which is scored 0 to 3), best gaze (scored 0 to 2), visual (scored 0 to 3), facial palsy (scored 0 to 3), motor arm (scored 0 to 4 in both arms), motor leg (scored 0 to 4 in both legs), limb ataxia (scored 0 to 2), sensory (scored 0 to 2), best language (scored 0 to 3), dysarthria (scored 0 to 2), and extinction and inattention (scored 0 to 2). The total NIHSS score is calculated by summing individual component scores. The max total score on NIHSS is 42 and the level of stroke severity as measured by the overall NIHSS score ranges from 0 (normal, no stroke) to 42 (severe stroke).\n\nThe mean percent change from baseline is being reported; the greater the negative value, the better the outcome.","populationDescription":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score was assessed in the Primary Analysis population.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","unitOfMeasure":"percent change","timeFrame":"Baseline up to Day 84 post non-hemorrhagic ischemic stroke","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"All Participants","description":"Participants who were obtained within 24 to 48 hours of a nonhemorrhagic ischemic stroke."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"113"}]}],"classes":[{"title":"Day 3","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"113"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-16.8","spread":"30.94"}]}]},{"title":"Day 7","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"113"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-30.3","spread":"40.33"}]}]},{"title":"Day 28","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-52.6","spread":"57.21"}]}]},{"title":"Day 56","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"96"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-63.0","spread":"43.60"}]}]},{"title":"Day 84","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"97"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-73.3","spread":"30.66"}]}]}]}]},"adverseEventsModule":{"frequencyThreshold":"5","timeFrame":"All-cause mortality was assessed from baseline up to Day 84 post non-hemorrhagic ischemic stroke.","description":"This was an observational study and no study drug was administered; therefore, safety events were not assessed in this study.","eventGroups":[{"id":"EG000","title":"All Participants","description":"Participants who were obtained within 24 to 48 hours of a nonhemorrhagic ischemic stroke.","deathsNumAffected":1,"deathsNumAtRisk":120,"seriousNumAffected":0,"seriousNumAtRisk":0,"otherNumAffected":0,"otherNumAtRisk":0}]},"moreInfoModule":{"certainAgreement":{"piSponsorEmployee":false,"restrictiveAgreement":false},"pointOfContact":{"title":"Contact for Clinical Trial Information","organization":"Daiichi Sankyo","email":"CTRinfo@dsi.com","phone":"908-992-6400"}}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":true}
