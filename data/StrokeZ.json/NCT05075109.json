It may provide further knowledge concerning the use of TENS for motor impairments in stroke patients and may clarify ambiguities to some extent.","detailedDescription":"Despite the positive effects of electrical stimulation proved on motor impairments of affected limb, the evidence is still not conclusive. There still remains a question mark regarding the effectiveness and optimal stimulation parameters of TENS. there has been conflict regarding the TENS parameters (frequency, duration, intensity) among different studies. To date TENS parameters used in different studies to reduce spasticity range from frequency of 1.7-100 Hz, duration from 15-60 minutes and sessions from 1-30. The use of different parameters may account for the contradictory results related to effectiveness of TENS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Spasticity","Upper limb","TENS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Frequency TENS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"high frequency TENS (100 Hz, 200 us) over the muscle belly of triceps and wrist extensors, for 5 days per week over 8 weeks combined with task related training.","interventionNames":["Device: High Frequency TENS"]},{"label":"Low Frequency TENS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"low frequency TENS (20 Hz, 0.2 us) over the muscle belly of triceps and wrist extensors, for 5 days per week over 8 weeks with task related training.","interventionNames":["Device: Low Frequency TENS"]},{"label":"Task Related Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"postural control, shoulder mobilization, weight bearing exercises, functional activities that will comprise of simple tasks to more advanced movement patterns","interventionNames":["Other: Task Related Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High Frequency TENS","description":"30 minutes of high frequency TENS (100 Hz, 200 us) over the muscle belly of triceps and wrist extensors, for 5 days per week over 8 weeks combined with task related training.","armGroupLabels":["High Frequency TENS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low Frequency TENS","description":"30 minutes of low frequency TENS (20 Hz, 0.2 us) over the muscle belly of triceps and wrist extensors, for 5 days per week over 8 weeks.

During procedure the therapist observe the muscle's ability to produce movement and respond to manual resistance to assign ordinal scores. 6 point scale is used to grade the muscle strength, (0,1,2,3,4,5) where 0 indicates no perceptible muscle contraction while 5 indicates maximum force generation by muscle against maximum resistance. The MMT has well established validity relative to other measures of muscle strength.","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","description":"The action research arm test has been used to assess the ability of affected limb to perform activities. It consists of 19 items in which subject is asked to grasp, move and release objects of different shape and size. They are also asked to perform gross movements. Each item is scored on 4 point scale with 0 indicating no action can be performed and 3 indicating that action has been performed successfully within time. validity and reliability of ARA has been confirmed with intra-rater reliability ranging from 0.71-0.99.","timeFrame":"8 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Both male and female aged 40-70 years\n* Middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke\n* 6 months after stroke\n* Mini-mental state examination (MMSE)more than 24\n* Modified Ashworth scale score between1 and 2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or with other pre-existing neurological disorders.\n* Patients with orthopedic condition affecting upper extremity\n* Patients with contraindication to TENS, like skin damaged etc.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mirza Obaid Baig, MSPT(NMR)","affiliation":"Riphah International University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chandka Medical College Hospital","city":"Larkana","state":"Sindh","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":27.55898,"lon":68.21204}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009128","term":"Muscle Spasticity"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009135","term":"Muscular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000009122","term":"Muscle Hypertonia"},{"id":"D000020879","term":"Neuromuscular Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","asFound":"Spasticity","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11782","name":"Muscular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11787","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11769","name":"Muscle Hypertonia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22309","name":"Neuromuscular Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
