More than 80% of strokes are the result of ischemia caused by blockage of one or more cerebral arteries. Lack of blood supply starves brain cells of necessary glucose and oxygen, and disturbs cellular homeostasis, eventually resulting in neuronal death.\n\nMitochondria are tiny organelles present in nearly all types of human cells and are vital to our survival. Much like a battery, they generate most of our adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell. Mitochondria are also involved in other tasks, such as signaling between cells and cell death. All these functions can be impaired during ischemia because of the damage caused to mitochondria.\n\nBased on many preclinical studies in animals, damage caused by ischemia can be reversed after infusing healthy mitochondria into injured tissues. An ongoing clinical trial in human hearts at Boston Children's Hospital has also demonstrated that transplanting autologous mitochondria via infusion or direct injection is well-tolerated and safe.\n\nThe investigators at the University of Washington are recruiting subjects for a first-in-human-brain trial to confirm the safety of autologous mitochondrial transplant during brain ischemia. The transplantation will be performed within the same procedure as the clinically indicated reperfusion treatment.\n\nDuring standard-of-care endovascular treatment for cerebral ischemia, the investigators will obtain a very small biopsy from the muscle tissue adjacent to our surgical access site. Muscle tissue will be processed at bedside to extract the autologous mitochondria as performed in prior human cardiac trial and validated in animal studies. The endovascular treatment proceeds without disruption as clinically indicated, and the mitochondria are infused into the brain artery via micro-catheter during reperfusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["autologous mitochondrial transplantation","ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transplantation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Endovascular infusion","interventionNames":["Other: Endovascular autologous mitochondrial transplantation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Endovascular autologous mitochondrial transplantation","description":"During standard-of-care endovascular reperfusion procedure, subjects will have autologous mitochondria infused via microcatheter into ischemic brain.","armGroupLabels":["Transplantation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of severe adverse events during mitochondrial infusion","description":"Cerebral angiography is performed and reviewed in real-time throughout the standard of care reperfusion treatment, including before and after microcatheter infusion of mitochondria.","timeFrame":"Through completion of reperfusion therapy, up to one hour post-infusion"},{"measure":"Incidence of severe adverse vascular events immediately post-mitochondrial infusion","description":"Post-reperfusion therapy, CT scans are performed as part of the standard of care.
