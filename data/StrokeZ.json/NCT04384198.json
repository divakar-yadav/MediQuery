During MitraClip implantation, all patients will receive continuous transcranial Doppler sonography using a 2-MHz diagnostic probe with maximal diagnostic energy administered through either the left or the right transtemporal window (computer-generated 1:1 randomization).\n\nThe primary endpoint is the median ischemic lesion volume detected on diffusion-weighted MRI after MitraClip implantation in the sonolysis group and in the control group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mitral Valve Insufficiency"],"keywords":["MitraClip","Sonolysis","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"PROBE","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sonolysis group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cerebral hemisphere with sonolysis during MitraClip implantation.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Sonolysis"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Cerebral hemisphere without sonolysis during MitraClip implantation."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Sonolysis","description":"Continuous transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) using a 2-MHz diagnostic probe with maximal diagnostic energy","armGroupLabels":["Sonolysis group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke volume","description":"median volume (in ml) of new ischemic lesions detected on diffusion-weighted MRI after MitraClip implantation in the sonolysis and in the control group","timeFrame":"0-5 days after the MitraClip Implantation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"diffusion-weighted MRI lesions","description":"new ischemic lesions (occurrence, number and location) detected on diffusion-weighted MRI after MitraClip implantation","timeFrame":"0-5 days after the MitraClip Implantation"},{"measure":"intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and / or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)","description":"new ICH and / or SAH detected on T2\\*-weighted MRI after MitraClip implantation","timeFrame":"0-5 days after the MitraClip Implantation"},{"measure":"cerebral microbleeds (CMB)","description":"new cerebral microbleeds detected on T2\\*-weighted MRI after MitraClip implantation (occurrence, number and location)","timeFrame":"0-5 days after the MitraClip Implantation"},{"measure":"clinically overt stroke","description":"new clinically overt stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) after MitraClip implantation","timeFrame":"(1) 0-5 days after the MitraClip Implantation and (2) 3 months after MitraClip implantation"},{"measure":"functional outcome","description":"functional outcome will be evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (mRS).
