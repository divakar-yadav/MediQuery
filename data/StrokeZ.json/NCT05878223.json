Extracorporeal shock waves (ESWT) have been proven therapeutic effects on decreasing spasticity and regaining function. Stroke patients often suffer ankle plantar flexor spasticity with poor ankle movement control, leading to abnormal gait patterns and risk of falling; local pain appears as well in the ankle. Research showed application of ESWT to lower extremity spasticity reduced ankle plantar flexor spasticity, ankle pain and increased the range of ankle motion. However, the current study did not investigate the effect of ESWT on different muscles in patients with post-stroke ankle spasticity. Therefore, this study will compare the effect of focused ESWT on combination of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to gastrocnemius muscle alone in the post-stroke ankle plantar flexor spasticity.","detailedDescription":"This study design was a single-blind randomized controlled trial and planned to recruit 40 chronic stroke patients with ankle plantar flexor spasticity. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group received focused ESWT to gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (2000 shots for each muscle, a total of 4000 shots per session), while the control group received focused ESWT to gastrocnemius muscle (2000 shots per session). Patients in both groups underwent a total of 4 sessions ESWT, twice a week for two consecutive weeks. The depths of ESWT to gastrocnemius and soleus muscle were determined by ultrasound. All patients received traditional rehabilitation. The primary outcome was modified Ashworth scale; the secondary outcomes were modified Tardieu scale, passive range of ankle motions and timed up and go test, and ultrasound evaluations (pennation angle and strain elastography of muscles). The outcomes were assessed before ESWT and after ESWT at 1, 4, 12, and 24 week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","spasticity","shock wave","ankle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"participants","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ESWT to gastrocnemius and soleus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ESWT to gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (2000 shots for each muscle, a total of 4000 shots per session)","interventionNames":["Device: Extracorporeal shock waves"]},{"label":"ESWT to gastrocnemius","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"ESWT to gastrocnemius muscle (2000 shots per session)","interventionNames":["Device: Extracorporeal shock waves"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Extracorporeal shock waves","description":"Both group received extracorporeal shock waves therapy","armGroupLabels":["ESWT to gastrocnemius","ESWT to gastrocnemius and soleus"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).
