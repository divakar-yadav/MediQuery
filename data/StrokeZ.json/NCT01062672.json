Subjects with retinal or cortical injury will be studied and compared to appropriate controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging methods are used to monitor cortical topography in time. The main aims of the study are to determine: 1) what are the patterns of cortical reorganization that are seen spontaneously after injury, and 2) whether rehabilitative training can promote adaptive reorganization enhancing recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Blindness","Vision"],"keywords":["plasticity","reorganization","cortical","fMRI","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stable lesion of the visual pathways resulting in a visual field scotoma.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to undergo magnetic resonance imaging,\n* Inability to comply with basic instructions,\n* Inability to perform the behavioral tasks required,\n* Patients with chronic progressive neurological or psychiatric disorders,\n* Patients that are pregnant, or breast feeding.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with lesions of the visual pathway (cortical or retinal)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Baylor College of Medicine","city":"Houston","state":"Texas","zip":"77030","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":29.76328,"lon":-95.36327}},{"facility":"Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics","city":"Tuebingen","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":48.52266,"lon":9.05222}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001766","term":"Blindness"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014786","term":"Vision Disorders"},{"id":"D000012678","term":"Sensation Disorders"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000005128","term":"Eye Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4737","name":"Blindness","asFound":"Blindness","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17220","name":"Vision Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15180","name":"Sensation Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7961","name":"Eye Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC11","name":"Eye Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
