Baseline diet consistency status was selected as a stratification factor because it is expected that patients with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) after stroke that results in need for modifications to food/liquids will have a different weight loss trajectory than patients who are able to safely consume a regular diet. The follow-up duration will be 12 weeks for all subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Obesity","Overweight","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The outcomes assessor is blinded to study group assignment","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diet Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The diet intervention is a partial meal replacement program using the commercially available OPTAVIA® Optimal Weight 4\\&2\\&1 Plan™.
