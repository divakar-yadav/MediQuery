A real-time feedback will control the robotic hand when motor imagery is successfully identified. Finally, the focalized BCI-robot training will be compared in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the training effectiveness and changes in the EEG patterns."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"fBCI-robot","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"focalized BCI-robot hand training","interventionNames":["Procedure: Brain Computer Interface"]},{"label":"gBCI-robot","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"generalized BCI-robot hand training","interventionNames":["Procedure: Brain Computer Interface"]},{"label":"sham-BCI","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham BCI","interventionNames":["Procedure: Brain Computer Interface"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Brain Computer Interface","armGroupLabels":["fBCI-robot","gBCI-robot","sham-BCI"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"FMA-UE","timeFrame":"3-month followup"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ARAT","timeFrame":"3-month followup"},{"measure":"MAS","timeFrame":"3-month followup"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n(1) sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions, as well as understand the content and purpose of the experiment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score\\>25) ; (2) subcortical location of the ischemic lesion within the territory of the middle cerebral artery; (3) have moderate to severe motor disability at the paretic upper limb (assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Ashworth Score of fingers (MAS), and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT))\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n(1) severe hand spasticity, open hand wound or hand deformity; (2) visual field deficits; (3) aphasia, neglect, and apraxia.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Division of Biomedical Engineering, Dept Electronic Engineering","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hong Kong","country":"Hong Kong","contacts":[{"name":"Raymond Tong, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+852 3943 8454"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":22.27832,"lon":114.17469}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
