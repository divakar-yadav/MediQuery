A total of 80 subjects will be randomly assigned to Huatuo Zaizao pill group or the control group.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Eighty patients with phlegm and blood stasis block syndrome of ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to Hua Hua reconstruction group or control group at a ratio of 1:1. The treatment period is 12 weeks. The purpose is to evaluate its efficacy and safety, provide an objective basis for precise treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, and improve clinical efficacy. The main result is the changes of NIHSS, Fugl-Meyer, and MAS 90 days after taking the drug. The secondary result is the change in ADL and TCM symptom scale (CM-SS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participants are randomly and evenly assigned to 2 groups using block randomization.Random numbers are generated by the stratified random method using the Statistical Analysis Software （SAS） statistical software and assigned by an independent statistician at the Good Clinical Practice Institute of XiYuan Hospital.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HuaTuo ZaiZao group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In this arm, patients take 8g of HuatuoZaizao pill three times a day.
