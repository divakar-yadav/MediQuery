A total of 164 participants will be recruited through a district community centre and randomly assigned on 1:1 ratio to the intervention group or the control group.\n\nIntervention: A theory-based mHealth-supported coach programme, including individual consultation sessions and a mobile application with a virtual sharing platform, is developed by a multidisciplinary team for the intervention group over three months, whereas the control group receives usual care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Disease Risk Factors"],"keywords":["Primary Health Care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":164,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Personalised mHeatlh-supported coaching programme","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Three monthly individual consultation session, supported with a specific mobile application.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: mHealth-supported coaching"]},{"label":"Traditional in-person health coaching programme","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Three monthly individual consultation sessions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional Health coaching"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"mHealth-supported coaching","description":"The intervention includes two components.
