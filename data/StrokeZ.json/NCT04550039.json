We will also evaluate the effect of these interventions on functional mobility, strength, balance, and endurance. Furthermore, we intend to measure therapist burden when mobilizing individuals with contraversive pushing behaviors.","detailedDescription":"High-intensity gait training is strongly supported in individuals poststroke to facilitate neuroplastic changes in the brain in order to maximize the recovery of functional independence. Individuals with contraversive pushing behaviors (CPB) poststroke are difficult to mobilize as a result of tilted posture with significant balance impairments, a tendency to push toward their hemiparetic side, and resistance to external correction. CPB has been reported in 12-18% of individuals receiving stroke rehabilitation and often leads to longer lengths of stay, poorer functional outcomes, and institutionalized discharge locations compared to individuals poststroke without CPB.\n\nHigh quality evidence guiding physical therapy intervention, specifically gait training, in individuals with CPB is scarce. Traditional therapeutic interventions in individuals with CPB consists of progressing functional mobility while orienting to midline with various forms of visual and tactile feedback. To further guide best practice in this population, we plan to investigate the effect of two high-intensity gait training interventions on CPB in 10 individuals poststroke in the acute inpatient rehabilitation setting over the course of one year.\n\nIndividuals from the inpatient stroke unit at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab will be recruited and placed into one of two intervention groups. Intervention for group one will consist of body-weight-supported treadmill training + overground gait training. Intervention for group two will consist of gait training in the EksoNR exoskeleton + overground gait training. The commercially available EksoNR is approved by the FDA for use in individuals with stroke diagnoses. We will also evaluate the effect of these interventions on functional outcomes including mobility, strength, balance, walking speed, and walking endurance in addition to measuring therapist burden when mobilizing individuals with CPB.\n\nBoth groups will receive their specified gait training intervention three sessions a week for at least three weeks until they discharge with the goal of maximizing the number of steps within a 60 minute session. Gait training interventions will be progressed to challenge individuals as appropriate in order to reach 70-85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. A fourth session will be utilized to assess weekly outcome measures as part of the standard of care at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. There will be no restrictions set on therapy delivered outside of these intervention training sessions as individuals will be getting other therapies each day as the standard of care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Gait","Exoskeleton","Robotics","Contraversive pushing behaviors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Body-weight-supported treadmill training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants complete prescribed gait training program for at least three weeks or until they discharge.","interventionNames":["Device: Body-weight-supported treadmill"]},{"label":"EksoNR exoskeleton","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants complete prescribed gait training program for at least three weeks or until they discharge.","interventionNames":["Device: Ekso Bionics EksoNR exoskeleton"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Body-weight-supported treadmill","description":"Gait training performed on treadmill with overhead harness providing necessary body-weight-support with assistance from trained physical therapist","armGroupLabels":["Body-weight-supported treadmill training"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Ekso Bionics EksoNR exoskeleton","description":"Gait training performed overground in EksoNR exoskeleton with assistance from trained physical therapist","armGroupLabels":["EksoNR exoskeleton"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Scale for Contraversive Pushing","description":"The Scale for Contraversive Pushing is a three-item test used to measure lateropulsion, scored on a three point ordinal scale.

Participants will be directed to walk at their comfortable, self-selected speed. Participants will be positioned at the start line and instructed to walk the entire 10 meter distance while the therapist times the middle six meters. The distance before and after the timed course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be recorded using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.46 sec). The test will be performed two times at self-selected speed with adequate rest in between. The average of the two times should be recorded. The test will then be repeated with the participants directed to walk at their fast but safe speed. Appropriate assistive devices, bracing, and the minimal amount of physical assistance from the physical therapist will be applied.","timeFrame":"Once weekly, through completion of study up to 8 weeks"},{"measure":"6 Minute Walk Test","description":"The 6 Minute Walk Test measures the distance a participant can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of six minutes. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test is self-paced. Participants are allowed to stop and rest during the test; however, the timer does not stop. If a participant is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.
