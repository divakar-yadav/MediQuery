Objectives: The main objective of this study was to compare the correlation and the agreement of the wave morphology between the ICP (standard ICP monitoring) and a new nICP monitor in patients admitted with stroke. Our secondary objective was to estimate the accuracy of four non-invasive methods to assess intracranial hypertension. Methods: We prospectively collected data of adults admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or ischemic stroke (IS) in whom invasive ICP monitoring placed. Measures had been simultaneously collected from the following non-invasive indices: optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), pulsatility index (PI) using transcranial Doppler (TCD), a 5-point visual scale designed for Computed Tomography (CT) and two parameters (time-to-peak \\[TTP\\] and P2/P1 ratio) of a non-invasive ICP wave morphology monitor (Brain4care\\[B4c\\]). Intracranial hypertension was defined as an invasively measured ICP \\> 20 mmHg for at least five minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Intracranial Hypertension"],"keywords":["non invasive icp monitor","icp wave morphology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ICP wave morphology comparison between a non-invasive (Brain4care) and a invasive method","description":"We prospectively collected data of adults admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or ischemic stroke (IS) in whom invasive ICP monitoring placed.
