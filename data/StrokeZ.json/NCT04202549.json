Although sufficient recanalization after thrombectomy is more than 80%, HERMES study indicated that nearly half of the ischemic stroke patients under thrombectomy suffered obvious disability. Artery reocclusion, hemorrhagic transformation, and no-reflow phenomenon are among the most important reasons of poor prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients. The investigators speculate that a combination of argatroban, edaravone, and glucocorticoid may be helpful in preventing artery reocclusion, hemorrhagic transformation, and no-reflow phenomenon. This study intends to explore the safety, feasibility and efficacy of thrombectomy with sufficient recanalization bridged by intra-arterial cocktail therapy in acute ischemic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intra-arterial cocktail therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intra-arterial administration of argatroban (0.2-0.3 mg/min), dexamethasone (0.1 mg/min) and edaravone (0.3 mg/min) for 30 to 60 minutes after thrombectomy","interventionNames":["Drug: intra-arterial cocktail therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"intra-arterial cocktail therapy","description":"Intra-arterial administration of argatroban (0.2-0.3 mg/min), dexamethasone (0.1 mg/min) and edaravone (0.3 mg/min) for 30 to 60 minutes after thrombectomy.","armGroupLabels":["intra-arterial cocktail therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of favorable outcome","description":"favorable outcome is defined as mRS 0-2","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of excellent outcome","description":"excellent outcome is defined as mRS 0-1","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"proportion of early neurological improvement","description":"early neurological improvement is defined as more than 4 decrease in NIHSS","timeFrame":"48 hours"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"incidence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage","description":"intracranial haemorrhage is defined as more than 4 increase in NIHSS caused by intracranial bleeding","timeFrame":"48 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
