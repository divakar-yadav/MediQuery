This phenomenon is known as remote ischemic preconditioning and may help protect brain cells after a stroke. The investigators are studying a specific stroke type called subcortical stroke that is very common and has a high rate of recurrent stroke and cognition problems despite intensive prevention measures.","detailedDescription":"In this study, the investigators will enroll 60 patients. All patients will receive best standard medical therapy for 2 years. In addition, the investigators will randomly assign 40 patients to undergo daily active remote ischemic preconditioning for 1 year, and 20 patients to 1 year of standard medical therapy followed by 1 year of daily active remote ischemic preconditioning. Patient structured interviews will be performed to assess if the treatment is well tolerated and easy for stroke patients to use. Magnetic resonance (MR) pictures of the brain will be used to determine if the active treatment stops the progression of brain injury. Cognitive tests and wireless sensor technology measures will used to learn what happens to the patient's brain and body during the active treatment.\n\nAfter a subject consents to participate in the study, he/she will first participate in a study screening phase to ensure a basic level of tolerability of Remote Ischemic Conditioning (autoRIC™) device. The subject will undergo one full cycle of treatment under observation of the study team, including 4 cycles of alternating 5 minute inflation and 5 minute off periods\n\nIf the subject indicates willingness to continue receiving such treatment (screening success), she/she will enter the randomized trial phase, and be randomly allocated to the treatment or control group.\n\nIf subject indicates unwillingness to continue receiving such treatment (screening failure), he/she will not advance to the randomized phase of the trial. Screen failure subjects will be followed up with a 3-day post-device screening phone call to ensure safety and obtain information regarding any adverse events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Cerebral Small Vessel Disease","Cognitive Decline"],"keywords":["ischemic preconditioning","remote ischemic preconditioning","ischemic stroke","white matter disease","cerebral small vessel disease","cognitive decline","leukoaraiosis","diffusion tensor imaging","white matter hyper intensity score","European scale of age-related white matter change"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Medical therapy only","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Intensive standard medical secondary prevention stroke treatment as per the recommendations of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association national guidelines."},{"label":"Ischemic Preconditioning + Medical","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive treatment with Cell Aegis remote ischemic preconditioning device once or twice daily for one year.
