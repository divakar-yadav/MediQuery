Non-contrast CT brain on admission\n  2. Day 2 MRI: after 2 days of admission, all the patients in this study will have a brain MRI (stroke protocol; T1W, T2W, FLAIR, DWI, T2 Echo Gradient, MRA of all intra-cerebral vessels).\n  3. CT brain: Any patient with unexplained clinical deterioration at any time throughout his/her hospital stay will be urgently imaged by CT.\n* Primary End Point:\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was the rate of new ischemic stroke at 90 days, and the primary safety outcome was the rate of drug hemorrhagic complications using the PLATO bleeding definition.\n\n• Secondary End Point: The secondary efficacy outcomes were to evaluate the rates of patients who achieved a significant reduction in NIHSS (decrease of four points or more) at the seventh day or discharge compared to baseline, the rates of a favorable outcome with (mRS = 0-2) after one week and after 90 days in a face-to-face interview in the outpatient clinic, rates of a composite of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction and death due to vascular events after 90 days of follow-up, while the secondary safety outcome was the rate of treatment-related adverse effects assessed by a follow-up questionnaire."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ticagrelor","clopidogrel","large-vessel ischemic stroke","Egypt"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The investigators will conduct our single-blinded randomized controlled trial, which will contain 2 arms; the ticagrelor arm will receive (a 180 mg loading dose during the first 24 hours of stroke onset, followed by 90 mg b.i.d from the 2nd to the 90th day).
