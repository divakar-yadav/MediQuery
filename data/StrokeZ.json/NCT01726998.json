The subjects with congestive heart failure, malignancies, cardiopulmonary dysfunctions, and who could not walk independently before stroke attack were excluded.\n\nTwo groups received 30 minutes conventional gait training including Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT) basically. The robotic assisted locomotor training group received additional robotic-assisted gait therapy for 30minutes with Lokomat® (Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland) daily for 4 weeks, and the conventional gait training group received additional daily conventional gait training with NDT for the same periods. The independent walking ability(FAC ≥ 3), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Motricity index (MI), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Medical Research Council (MRC) for each lower extremity muscles were assessed before, during (2weeks) and after training. And the independent walking ability were followed until 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparetic Patients After Subacute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lokomat Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Robot-assisted gait therapy"]},{"label":"conventional gait training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: conventional gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot-assisted gait therapy","description":"Two groups received 30 minutes conventional gait training including Neurodevelopmental Treatment(NDT) basically.
