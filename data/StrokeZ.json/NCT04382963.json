This team will develop a series of Oneida Nation Healthy Living and Stroke Awareness Events (from now on health events) to provide education as to the severity of the problem as well as our standard therapies for lifestyle change and risk factor avoidance. This will include education of the healthy members of the tribe including the children to identify signs of stroke and TIA in their elders as well as to develop healthy lifestyles at the earliest of ages to influence the elders to modify their risks.","detailedDescription":"The study will enroll 100 high risk tribe members and 20 low stroke risk tribe members. Each of these will be further studied for their atherosclerotic load by ultrasound measurements at the carotid bifurcation for presence of plaque as well as its stability or instability during pulsation. Enrolled participants will also receive assessment of biomarkers for stroke risk, including stroke-related vascular cognitive decline, an early and modifiable marker of TIA risk and serum analysis for glucose, cholesterol, microRNA and key proteins felt to be biomarkers of stroke.\n\nThe high risk participants will be randomized into two groups, and data analyzed by gender, age, history of cerebrovascular events, and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis in their carotid bifurcation including equal numbers of participants that in spite of high risk, have not yet deposited plaque.\n\n* One group will receive advice about standard therapy and information concerning risk factor guidelines to improve health awareness.\n* The other group will receive the same plus intensive initiation of the American Heart Association Guidelines for Management of Risk Factors with at least quarterly individual face-to-face coaching meetings on lifestyle change and adherence to treatment.\n\nAt the end of 2-year follow-up, all groups will be reassessed for adherence to the program, atherosclerotic plaque progression or regression and its stability, serum biomarker response to therapy interventions, successful risk factor modification, vascular cognitive decline and incidence of stroke and TIA. Intention to treat analysis will estimate the efficacy of health coaching and will use G-estimation to correct for issues of non-compliance and discontinuation. Groups will be compared for change in both risk factors and outcomes.\n\nVascular cognitive decline is an important symptom of cerebrovascular disease which may precede a physical stroke with devastating results. Extensive preliminary data show that the frequency of this is surprisingly common in high risk patients and may predispose patients to later dementia. Vascular cognitive decline is a risk factor for stroke, but also is modifiable. A prior small study showed that intervention could stop the rate of decline. The study will see if this predicts participants at greatest risk for stroke that would improve with an intensive intervention program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Atherosclerosis","Native American","Risk factor modification","Proteonomics","Genomics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Risk- intense coaching","type":"OTHER","description":"age ≥ 55 with MORE than three of the following risk factors:\n\n* History of TIA/Stroke\n* History of Coronary Artery disease\n* History of Hypertension and/or current elevated blood pressure\n* History of Diabetes\n* Current smoker\n* BMI ≥30","interventionNames":["Other: High Risk -
