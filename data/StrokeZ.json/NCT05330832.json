Thrombodynamics test is a method for blood coagulation and anticoagulation monitoring. It could be a useful tool for predicting thrombohemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19 infection and developing a novel scheme of anticoagulant therapy.\n\nInclusion criteria are the following: patient informed concern, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, state of modern or critical condition.","detailedDescription":"The novel coronavirus viral infection (currently classified as COVID-19) causes a significant increase in death rate worldwide. Most of the patients with COVID-19 develop respiratory failure as well as coagulopathy.\n\nThe International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has recently published guidelines for the treatment of coagulopathies in patients with COVID-19. It suggests using prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in all patients with COVID-19. Numerous studies show a high percentage of thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 as well as its potential association with pulmonary vessels microthrombosis and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is believed that COVID-19-associated coagulopathy could happen presumably due to the systemic inflammation. However, there are still no unified criteria for anticoagulant prophylaxis in such patients.\n\nWhat is more, the severity of COVID-19 infection is also associated with high risk of life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome with massive uncontrolled bleeding.\n\nAccording to the current clinical guidelines, coagulopathy in COVID-19 can be only registered with standard tests (prothrombin time (PT), platelet concentration and D-dimer). However, the lengthening of PT and the drop in platelet concentration are useful for the indication of the consumption stage of DIC. These changes mean that any patient remains already at risk of bleeding and the LMWH is no longer effective. The concentration of D-dimers shows the lysis of clots formed as a result of hypercoagulation, which also makes it a \"delayed\" marker of hypercoagulation. Thus, there are currently no reliable laboratory tools for hypercoagulation diagnostics in patients with COVID-19.\n\nThrombodynamics test is a global hemostasis test that allows to register the dynamics of fibrin clot formation in time and space. This test is highly sensitive to both hyper- and hypocoagulation and, at the same time, it allows to control anticoagulant therapy with heparins. The use of thrombodynamics test for the prediction of thrombohemorrhagic complications in this group of patients could be useful for individual correction of anticoagulant treatment and prevention of coagulopathy in COVID-19.\n\nThe aim of the study is estimating the predictive capability of thrombodynamics for SARS-CoV-2 associated coagulopathy in patients with severe pneumonia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronavirus Disease 2019"],"keywords":["COVID-19","venous thromboembolism","pulmonary embolism","myocardial infarction","ischemic stroke","atherothrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Whole blood (Ailiton, UNIVAC plastic tubes, 4,5 mL with Sodium citrate 3,2%)"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection","description":"Hospitalized patients with modern or critical condition with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
