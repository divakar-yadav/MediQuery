Therefore invasive procedures as Picco2-system, FloTrac and transesophageal echocardiography (tee) have the advantage to measure or calculate stroke volume. Disadvantage of this treatments is the need for a vascular access with all its complications.\n\nIn this study the stroke volume measured by a new noninvasive finger cuff system (NexFin) should be validated in comparison to invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems as Picco2-system, FloTrac and tee."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Volume","Mean Arterial Pressure"],"keywords":["hemodynamic monitoring systems","stroke volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nexfin","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Nexfin is used in all patients","interventionNames":["Device: NexFin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NexFin","description":"noninvasive finger cuff system","armGroupLabels":["Nexfin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke volume","timeFrame":"preinduction, 3 and 15 minutes after induction, before and after a volume challenge, 30 minutes after induction, end of surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mean arterial pressure","timeFrame":"preinduction, 3 and 15 minutes after induction, before and after volume challenge, 30 minutes after induction, end of surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients undergoing orthopedic surgery with need for invasive blood pressure measurements\n* age ≥ 18 years\n* signed informed consent\n* no participation on another interventional study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* refusal of participation\n* patients who are not able to sign informed consent\n* atrial fibrillation with arrhythmia\n* peripheral arterial disease \\> Fontain IIa\n* scleroderma\n* presence of an arterio-venous shunt on upper limb\n* contraindication for femoral arterial vascular access\n* contraindication for transesophageal echocardiography\n* stage III heart valve defects\n* shunt heart defects\n* solitary regional anaesthesia\n* pregnant or breastfeeding women","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Michael Sander, MD","affiliation":"Dept. of Anesthesiology Charité Universitaetsmedizin Berlin","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Claudia Spies, MD","affiliation":"Dept. of Anesthesiology Charité Universitaetsmedizin Berlin","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine Campus Charité Mitte / Campus Virchow-Klinikum","city":"Berlin","zip":"10117","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.52437,"lon":13.41053}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
