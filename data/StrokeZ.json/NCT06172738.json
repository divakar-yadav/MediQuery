The etiology of postoperative stroke is multifactorial and may include carotid artery stenosis, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, aortic atherosclerosis, and transient hypercoagulable state.\n\nMost strokes complicating cardiac surgery occur in patients without significant carotid disease and are acquired after the patient awakens neurologically intact. The high incidence of postoperative AF in these patients suggests a possible embolic cause for some strokes. As such, some postoperative strokes may be preventable.\n\nPrevious studies report incident AF in 10 to 65% of patients after open heart surgery, with the highest incidences after a combination of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve surgery.\n\nIn patients with non-operative AF, the risk of ischemic stroke is markedly reduced by adequate OAC. However, the management of postoperative AF is still a challenge and is, by some, regarded as a transient phenomenon not requiring intervention. The risk of bleeding poses a significant limitation to the use of OAC, which consequently increases focus on left atrial appendage (LAA) closure, as the LAA is a predilection site for thrombus formation during AF.\n\nBased on previous studies, ≥90% of AF-related left atrial thrombi are located in the left atrial appendage (LAA), and therefore, LAA occlusion is a tempting method for AF-related stroke prevention.\n\nCurrent recommendations regarding surgical left atrial appendage (LAA) closure to prevent thromboembolisms lack high-level evidence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Left Atrial Appendage Thrombosis"],"keywords":["surgical closure of the left atrial appendage.","stroke","Post operative atrial fibrillation."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized control trial.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"double blinded.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group A.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"surgical closure of the left atrial appendage.","interventionNames":["Procedure: the left atrial appendage closure through surgery."]},{"label":"group B.","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"There was no surgical closure of the left atrial appendage."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"the left atrial appendage closure through surgery.","description":"Surgical closure of the left atrial appendage during the set of an elective open heart surgery with the inclusion criteria fulfilled.","armGroupLabels":["group A."],"otherNames":["LAACS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke.","description":"the incidence of stroke in patients undergoing open-heart surgery, including transient ischemic attack, as assigned by two independent neurologists blinded to the treatment allocation.","timeFrame":"2 years post operative."},{"measure":"Mortality","description":"post-operative mortality rate.","timeFrame":"2 years post operative."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative arrhythmias.","description":"Incidence of postoperative arrhythmias with special regard to post-operative AF.","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Hospital stay.","description":"Number of inpatient hospital stay days.","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ≥18 years scheduled for first-time planned open-heart surgery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPediatric population \\>18 years.
