A total of 156 patients are planned in this study.","detailedDescription":"This is a two-part, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in acute ischemic stroke patients. In Part A, approximately 36 participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio (investigational drug: placebo) into 1 of 3 planned ascending dose groups to determine the dose levels to be studied in Part B. Two dose levels will be chosen based upon a review of all available data including safety, PK, PD and preliminary efficacy. In Part B, approximately 120 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of two dose levels of study drug or placebo.\n\nAll participants will be screened for participation after confirmed diagnosis of an anterior circulation ischemic stroke by neurovascular imaging. Enrolled participants will be followed for 90 days. Radiological outcomes will be assessed by a central blinded reviewer. A Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review safety and preliminary efficacy data throughout the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Wake-up
