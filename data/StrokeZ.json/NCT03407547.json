New technologies may be able to help these important problems. However, there is currently not enough knowledge about how the brain recovers in people with sensory impairments in their arm and hand. Using a non-invasive technique of recording brain activity, known as electroencephalography (EEG), brain activity in combination with somatosensation of the hand will be measured. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to analyse brain activity in relation to somatosensory impairments after stroke during the first two weeks after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["upper limb","recovery","somatosensory","impairment","electroencephalography","acute phase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Electroencephalography","description":"EEG is a device to measure brain activity via surface electrodes"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sensory Evoked Potential Latency","description":"EEG measurement","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"},{"measure":"Sensory Evoked Potential Amplitude","description":"EEG measurement","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment","description":"Upper limb motor impairment measurement","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"Upper limb activities measurement","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"},{"measure":"Perceptual Threshold of Touch","description":"Light touch of the palmar surface of index finger","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"},{"measure":"Erasmus modified Nottingham Sensory Assessment","description":"Measures somatosensation of the upper limb and hand","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"},{"measure":"Nottingham Sensory Assessment","description":"Measures stereognosis","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment","description":"Measures cognition","timeFrame":"First 2 weeks post-stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Participants will be recruited during the first 2-3 days post-stroke.
