The treatment programme for all groups consisted of 12 sessions (4 per week for 3 weeks) movement practice for the hemiplegic arm involved 5 table-top tasks graded according to the severity of patients' arm impairments. Blinded assessments were administered at baseline, 3-week postintervention, and 3-week follow-up upon completion of training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["The Effects of Mirror Therapy on Patients With Unilateral Neglect After Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke; unilateral neglect; mirror therapy; mirror visual feedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Mirror therapy"]},{"label":"Sham mirror","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sham mirror"]},{"label":"Covered mirror","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Covered mirror"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Mirror therapy","description":"A mirror is placed at the midsagittal plane of the patient.
