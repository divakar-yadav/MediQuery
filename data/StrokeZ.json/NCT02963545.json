Peripheral abnormalities in serotonin parameters were described in depression and tobacco smoking. The investigators hypothesized dysregulations in pathways of serotonin (5-HT), which has notably complex vasomotor effects and of kynurenine which could have cognitive dysfunction effects.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate simultaneously the involvement of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters in patients suffering from a cerebral infarction shortly after the onset (less than 4 hours and a half), within a 2 days follow-up (Day 1 and Day 2) and 3 months after the cerebral infarction.","detailedDescription":"Tryptophan (TRP), an essential aminoacid, is metabolized in the serotonin (5-HT) or in the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Serotonin is catabolized to 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole amino acid) by monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). The TRP to KYN transformation is regulated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).\n\nThe primary objective was the measurements of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters which were performed in blood and urine samples using different HPLC techniques and of serotonin transporters and receptors which were determined in blood platelets. The results in patients were compared to those measured in controls matched for age, gender, tobacco consumption and season of inclusion.\n\nThe secondary objective was to evaluate the potential relationships between these 5-HT and Kyn pathways biomarkers concentrations, MAOA and IDO enzymatic activations and clinical outcome and criteria."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients presenting cerebral infarction","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"no intervention of health product administration,","interventionNames":["Other: Usual care patients in neurology department","Biological: blood and urines sampling","Procedure: Psychiatric evaluation"]},{"label":"Historical controls","type":"OTHER","description":"no intervention of health product administration, patients characteristics, history, matched with patients for age, gender, tobacco consumption and season of inclusion, free of neurologic or psychiatric disease or psychotropic medications or medications known to impact on serotonin","interventionNames":["Biological: blood and urines sampling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual care patients in neurology department","description":"patients characteristics, history, clinical signs chronology and usual medical care by the emergency units, cerebral infarction area","armGroupLabels":["Patients presenting cerebral infarction"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"blood and urines sampling","description":"Collection samples for biochemical determinations of serotonin pathway and kynurenine pathway parameters determinations","armGroupLabels":["Historical controls","Patients presenting cerebral infarction"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Psychiatric evaluation","description":"depression scale, impulsivity scale, hostility scale , tobacco consumption questioning","armGroupLabels":["Patients presenting cerebral infarction"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measure of serotonin pathway parameters concentrations in blood and urine samples","description":"platelet serotonin (nM), plasma serotonin (nM), urine serotonin (nM) , plasma 5-HIAA (nM) , urine 5-HIAA (nM) concentrations using three different HPLC systems and methods.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Measure of serotonin pathway parameters in blood samples","description":"Blood platelets assessements of serotonin (5-HT) transporters using \\[3H\\]paroxetine ligand ( fmol/mg proteins) and 5-HT2A receptors using \\[3H\\]MDL-100,907 ligand ( fmol/mg proteins)","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Measure of serotonin pathway parameters in blood and urine samples","description":"platelet serotonin (nM), plasma serotonin (nM), urine serotonin (nM) , plasma 5-HIAA (nM) , urine 5-HIAA (nM) concentrations using three different HPLC systems and methods","timeFrame":"Day 2"},{"measure":"Measure of serotonin pathway parameters in blood and urine samples","description":"platelet serotonin (nM), plasma serotonin (nM), urine serotonin (nM) , plasma 5-HIAA (nM) , urine 5-HIAA (nM) concentrations using three different HPLC systems and methods","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Measure of kynurenin pathway parameters in blood samples","description":"The first and regulatory enzyme of the kynurenine pathway is the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).
