This project will investigate effects of a novel theory-driven 6-week virtual Personal Resource Building and Inclusive Volunteering Intervention (PVI) on young stroke survivors' work ability, self-efficacy and psychosocial outcomes. A 2-arm, assessor-blind, randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or PVI with usual care and the control group participants will receive usual stroke care services. Outcomes including work ability, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, emotional well-being and social skills will be measured at baseline, immediately post-PVI and 3 months post-PVI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Return to work"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A 2-arm, assessor-blind, randomised controlled trial will be conducted.","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessor-blinded.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Personal Resource Building and Inclusive Volunteering Intervention (PVI)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants in the intervention group will receive the intervention (PVI) in addition to usual care.
