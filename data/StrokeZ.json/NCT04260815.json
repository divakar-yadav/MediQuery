It has been shown that tDCS can improve language performance in healthy and brain-injured individuals such as increased naming accuracy.\n\nHowever, at present, it is not known what effect tDCS has on higher-level language skills like discourse production (i.e. story telling, giving instructions) in healthy, older speakers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate in healthy older adults, the effect of tDCS on discourse production as well as the ideal tDCS electrode placement for improving language at the discourse level. It is hypothesised that tDCS will result in greater language changes and improvements during discourse production compared to no stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Language Disorders","Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"anodal tDCS on the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"anodal tDCS on the right IFG","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)","description":"Transcranial direct-current stimulation is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that can modify spontaneous cortical activity in targeted brain regions.
