All seated exercises sessions and assessments will be conducted virtually.","detailedDescription":"The study will be a virtual 10-week multi-site, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with an embedded qualitative component. The study will be conducted in real time using secure videoconferencing software (Zoom). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to a 10-week Seated Exercise group or a delayed 2-week Seated Exercise Group (Boot Camp). Seated exercise sessions will be delivered and supervised by a trained instructor.\n\nParticipants will use their own computer, laptop, or tablet for the zoom sessions. No Zoom sessions will be recorded. Caregivers will be invited to attend each exercise session to provide support and assistance but are not obliged to attend. A caregiver, friend, or family member will be required for each assessment to participate in the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Chronic Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Stroke","Seated Exercise","Balance","Mobility","Cardiometabolic health","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"10-week group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Will receive a 10-week seated exercise program, occurring 3 times per week.
