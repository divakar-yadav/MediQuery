Anti-platelet aggregation therapy plays important role for secondary prevention of cerebral infarction. G6PD deficiency is a rare genetic disorder, patients with this disorder could suffer hemolysis after eating broad beans. Professor Zeng Jinsheng et al found that the hemolysis risk of G6PD deficiency patients was significantly increased when aspirin was applied in Guangdong Province. However, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in northern China remains unknown, as well as the safety of antiplatelet therapy. To this end, 1000 patients with acute cerebral infarction will be continuously included in 30 second-level and above hospitals in 10 prefectures and cities of Shaanxi Province for observation and follow-up for 12 months, to explore the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in cerebral infarction patients in Shaanxi Province, and to analyze the relationship between G6PD deficiency and the clinical characteristics and prognosis of cerebral infarction. To clarify the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet therapy for G6PD patients with cerebral infarction is of great significance for guiding the individualized treatment of cerebral infarction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction","G6PD Deficiency"],"keywords":["Cerebral Infarction","G6PD Deficiency","Hemorrhagic transformation","Antiplatelet therapy","Antioxidant therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"G6PD Deficiency","description":"In the laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi 'an Jiaotong University, tetrazolazole-blue quantitative method will be used to detect G6PD.
