The performance setting of the valve can be set preoperatively and can also be noninvasively changed post-implantation.\n\nThis clinical investigation will maintain data for each patient from the date of implant through 3 years post-implantation.\n\nData collection for each patient will occur per standard of care.\n\nHowever, the clinical investigation specifically aims to collect and analyze data from the day of procedure, and post-operatively at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months.\n\nData from follow-up visits will be analyzed according to pre-defined time-intervals referring to these follow-up moments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hydrocephalus","Hydrocephalus in Children","NPH (Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus)","IIH - Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension","Brain Tumor","Post-Traumatic Hydrocephalus","Hemorrhagic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":158,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CODMAN CERTAS Programmable Valves","description":"CODMAN CERTAS Plus Programmable Valve, CODMAN CERTAS Plus Small Inline Programmable Valve, and CODMAN CERTAS Plus Right Angle Programmable Valve.","interventionNames":["Device: CODMAN CERTAS Plus Programmable Valve"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"CODMAN CERTAS Plus Programmable Valve","description":"Patients will undergo implantation of the CODMAN CERTAS Plus Programmable Valve according to the device label.","armGroupLabels":["CODMAN CERTAS Programmable Valves"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Device success - Time Frame: Days","description":"Device Success is defined as:\n\n1.
