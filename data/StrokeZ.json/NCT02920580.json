It will directly compare (1) prompt extubation vs. (2) usual care, with extubation or tracheostomy timed according to physicians' discretion. The primary outcome will be ICU free days (days spent alive and outside an ICU).","detailedDescription":"Thousands of patients suffer severe brain injuries every year, from causes such as trauma, stroke, and infection. Extensive clinical research in weaning from mechanical ventilation has led to recommendations for prompt extubation following a successful trial of spontaneous breathing in general intensive care unit (ICU). However, little evidence exists to guide decisions about when to remove the breathing tube in patients with severe brain injury. It is unclear which of the following strategies would optimize important patient outcomes: prompt extubation vs. waiting and extubating or performing a tracheostomy, timed according to physicians' discretion. Each strategy has associated risks: prompt extubation may lead to higher rates of extubation failure and reintubation, whereas waiting longer may expose patients to complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy may lead to procedural complications (or unnecessary procedures, if prompt extubation would be successful). This trial in brain-injured patients will test which of the following will lead to better patient outcomes: (1) removing the endotracheal tube promptly once a spontaneous breathing trial is passed; or (2) usual care, with the airway management strategy selected according to the preference of the treating physician."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Subarachnoid hemorrhage","Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage","Global cerebral anoxia/cardiac arrest","Meningitis/Encephalitis/Cerebral abscess","Seizure","Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)","Ischemic Stroke","Brain tumor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Extubation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Extubation by removal of endotracheal tube.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Extubation"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The usual clinical practice is removal of the endotracheal tube (extubation), or insertion of tracheostomy, timed according to physicians' discretion","interventionNames":["Procedure: Usual Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Extubation","description":"This is an extubation by removal of endotracheal tube which must be done on the day of randomization or the following day.

Similarly, if a tracheostomy is deemed necessary in a patient who fails the extubation attempt, this will be managed at the discretion of the treating team. If for any reason the patient is not extubated according to the randomized schedule, the reason(s) will be recorded on a protocol violation form and the site investigator will be notified.
