In the present study, a new cross-modal, visuo-motor PAS protocol - called \"mirror-PAS\"- will be tested as a possible non-invasive brain stimulation treatment in neurological rehabilitation to promote motor recovery and pain reduction.\n\nParticipants will perform the standard PAS targeting the motor system and the recently developed mirror-PAS in two separate sessions. The investigators will compare the possible effect of the protocols in terms of neurophysiological and behavioral outcomes to identify the optimal PAS method to enhance plasticity and promote sensory-motor function.","detailedDescription":"The motor recovery of the upper limb function, particularly of the hand, is challenging in neurological rehabilitation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that can enhance motor recovery, though promoting brain plasticity of the brain.\n\nIn this study, researchers will use a TMS protocol called Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS), in which two stimuli (e.g., a cortical stimulus - delivered with TMS - and a peripheral stimulus) are repeatedly associated to promote associative plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1).\n\nThe objective is to explore the clinical efficacy of a newly developed cross-modal PAS protocol -the so-called \"mirror-PAS\"- as a possible motor rehabilitation treatment in patients with upper limb motor disorders, investigating its neurophysiological and behavioural effects. The innovative aspect of mirror-PAS is to act on a more extended visuomotor network, featured by the functional properties of the mirror neuron system (MNS). Indeed, in the mirror-PAS, a visual stimulus depicting a hand movement is repeatedly paired with a TMS pulse over M1. In the healthy, this protocol was found effective in modulating neurophysiological responses of the motor cortex (i..e, MEPs), hence inducing these effects bypassing the afferent somatosensory pathway exploited by the standard PAS protocols. This may represent a clinical advantage allowing the promotion of motor recovery through the induction of a plastic reorganization in the damaged motor system by gaining access through a potentially spared MNS.\n\nThe project's first phase aims to assess the motor and neurophysiological effects of mirror-PAS in stroke patients with upper-limb hemiparesis, compared to the standard excitatory M1-PAS (whose effects are well known in the literature, even if still debated).\n\nIn the second phase, we will test the efficacy of the mirror-PAS in a population of amputated patients affected by phantom limb pain (PLP)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Phantom Limb Pain"],"keywords":["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Paired Associative Stimulation","Stroke","Motor cortex","Phantom limb pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"In a first phase \\[Phase 1\\], the study aims to assess the motor and neurophysiological effects of a cross-modal 'mirror-PAS' protocol in stroke patients with upper-limb hemiparesis, compared to the standard excitatory M1-PAS.\n\nIn a second phase of the study \\[Phase 2\\], we will test the efficacy of the aforementioned cross-modal PAS in a population of amputated patients affected by phantom limb pain (PLP).","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"[Phase 1] Stroke patients with upper-limb hemiparesis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},{"label":"[Phase 2] Patients with phantom limb pain (PLP)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","description":"The standard PAS protocol will be compared with the mirrorPAS protocol.","armGroupLabels":["[Phase 1] Stroke patients with upper-limb hemiparesis","[Phase 2] Patients with phantom limb pain (PLP)"],"otherNames":["TMS","Paired associative stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in motor-evoked potentials (MEP)","description":"\\[Phase 1, only in stroke patients\\] peak-to-peak MEP amplitude","timeFrame":"At baseline and after the administration of the PAS protocols"},{"measure":"Change in functional mapping of phantom limb cortical areas","description":"\\[Phase 2, only in PLP patients\\]","timeFrame":"At baseline and after the administration of the PAS protocols"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria for stroke patients:\n\n* age from 18 to 85 years\n* single, unilateral, hemispheric stroke (cortical or sub-cortical areas)\n* stroke confirmed by neuroimaging (CT or MRI)\n* stroke at least 4 months before enrollment\n* hemiparesis of the upper limb resulting from stroke or hemianesthesia clinically documented\n\nExclusion criteria for stroke patients:\n\n* contraindications to TMS (Rossi et all, 2021)\n* other neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS)\n* other orthopedic condition that affected the hand (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome)\n\nInclusion criteria for PLP patients:\n\n* age from 18 to 90 years\n* amputation of one part of the upper limb at least 2 months before enrollment\n* presence of stable phantom limb pain at least 2 months prior to enrollment\n\nExclusion criteria for PLP patients:\n\n* contraindications to TMS (Rossi et all, 2021)\n* other neurological, orthopedical or psychiatric conditions","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Nadia Bolognini, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+390261911","phoneExt":"6127","email":"n.bolognini@auxologico.it"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nadia Bolognini, PhD","affiliation":"Laboratorio di Neuropsicologia, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Milan","state":"Lombardia","zip":"20122","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Nadia Bolognini, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+390261911","phoneExt":"6127","email":"n.bolognini@auxologico.it"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.46427,"lon":9.18951}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34302877","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Guidali G, Roncoroni C, Bolognini N.
