The target population is a stroke cohort with a known infarct volume who presents within 8 hours from symptom onset with a NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score \\>10. Functional outcome as defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of all enrolled patients will be followed for 90 days after the index event. This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center trial. Up to 200 patients at up to 30 centers will be enrolled in the study. It is anticipated that up to 150 evaluable patients will be needed for analysis. The sample size estimate is based on the primary study functional outcome at 90 days as defined by a mRS of 0-2. Assuming that this observational study will have as outcome of 25% (37/150) mRS 0-2 at day 90, the expected two-sided exact binomial confidence interval is (18%, 32%). This sample size is adequate to estimate the mRS outcome of 0-2 at day 90 for the natural history of acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":142,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of Care","description":"Standard of Care for stroke except mechanical therapy"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with a modified Rankin score of 2 or less","timeFrame":"90 days after the procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS score of 0-1 or a 10 or more points improvement","timeFrame":"Discharge"},{"measure":"All cause mortality","timeFrame":"90 days post-procedure"},{"measure":"Incidents of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","timeFrame":"90 days post-procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* From 18 to 85 years of age\n* Evidence of proximal anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (TIMI 0-1/TICI 0-1)from CT Angiography.
