The most recent report from the National Diabetes Audit showed that only one in three people with diabetes are achieving recommended standards for controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels; and only three in five received basic care processes to reduce their risk of diabetes-related complications such as blindness, amputation and kidney disease. Women did 15% worse than men, which may explain some of the reported higher excess risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, consequent to diabetes in women than men. More efficient and equitable care in people with diabetes could lead to substantial cost savings, and would improve the lives of women and men currently living with diabetes.\n\nThe objective of this research isto evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with medication use for controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels in men and women with diabetes treated in primary care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Diabetes mellitus","Stroke","Myocardial infarction","Stable angina pectoris","Heart failure","Quality of care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention is given.","description":"This study is based on the analysis of linked electronic health records (CALIBER dataset)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"First occurrence of cardiovascular disease","description":"First recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease during follow-up: stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, unheralded coronary death, heart failure, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death","timeFrame":"10 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular mortality","description":"Composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality","timeFrame":"10 years"},{"measure":"All cause mortality","description":"Composite endpoint of all cause mortality","timeFrame":"10 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with diabetes at or before study entry, and participants who develop new-onset diabetes during follow-up.\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Data collected in the period 1997-2010\n* Minimum time since registration of 1 year\n* Minimum of 1 year of up to standard data (CPRD quality standard)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n• None","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients in the CALIBER database who have diabetes, are included in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and consented to data linkage.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sanne Peters","affiliation":"The George Institute","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"The George Institute for Global Health, Nuffield Department for Population Health, University of Oxford","city":"Oxford","zip":"OX1 3BD","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.75222,"lon":-1.25596}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9111","name":"Heart Failure","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6805","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3807","name":"Angina Pectoris","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M29265","name":"Angina, Stable","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25093","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7552","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
