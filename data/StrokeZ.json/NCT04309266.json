The hope is to help participants make gains in both hand/arm skills and progress in everyday activities such as self-care, play, school and work. Participation will look like regular therapy with sessions 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. Each visit will include time for games on the Amadeo and time spent problem solving current activity challenges for each child. Families are encouraged to participate.","detailedDescription":"Robot assisted therapy and Active Learning Program for Stroke (ALPS) are unique interventions that are feasible and effective for individuals with neuromotor impairments. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel intervention approach and thus there are no preliminary studies to acknowledge that reference this combined technique. There have been studies which evaluated the Amadeo and metacognitive approaches in isolation, but not combined.\n\nThe goal of this pilot study is to better understand the impact of a combined approach using both robot assisted therapy and metacognitive skills training through ALPS on the functional performance outcomes of children with hemiparesis. Our primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of this pilot study intervention as measured by adequate recruitment of necessary population, participant attendance to scheduled sessions, participant adherence to home program and clinician competence/adherence with protocol administration. Our secondary aim is to understand the preliminary impact of a combined approach to intervention involving robot-assisted therapy and a metacognitive strategy training ALPS on upper limb motor skills and function of children with hemiparesis. It is hypothesized that utilizing this combined bottom-up and top-down approach will be a feasible option for intervention and that preliminary outcomes will be promising. If successful, this project has the potential to improve rehabilitation and habilitation outcomes of children with hemiparesis.\n\nThis study will be set as a prospective pilot study with pre- and post-intervention and one month follow-up evaluation. Study procedures will occur within Boston Children's Hospital's Department of Physical and Occupational Therapy Service. For the duration of this trial, participants will not be allowed to participate in additional occupational therapy intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis","Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy","Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA"],"keywords":["arm weakness","cerebral palsy","stroke","in utero","cognition","occupational therapy","robot therapy","robot assisted therapy","metacognition","children","pediatric","Amadeo","arm","upper extremity","Tyromotion","ALPS","motor learning","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot Assisted Therapy with Metacognitive Skills Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will be enrolled in the single arm of this study, where they will receive robot assisted therapy combined with metacognitive skills training.","interventionNames":["Device: Amadeo by Tyromotion","Behavioral: Active Learning Protocol for Stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Amadeo by Tyromotion","description":"Distal upper extremity/hand robot for robot-assisted therapy","armGroupLabels":["Robot Assisted Therapy with Metacognitive Skills Training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Active Learning Protocol for Stroke","description":"Metacognitive approach involving active problem solving for using the affected upper extremity in motoric activities.
