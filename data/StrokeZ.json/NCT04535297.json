These are important aspects of self-management. However, this was challenged by the social distancing due to COVID-19, which limited participation in regular routines.\n\nThe study objectives were: To (1) describe the effects of the COVID-19 social distancing on function, health and well-being of patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke, and (2) test the association between the patient activation level and these effects.\n\nCommunity-living patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke were invited to answer an anonymous survey through social media and patient associations. Part 1 included 27 multiple-choice questions regarding current status and changes in function, health, medical care and well-being. Part 2 consisted of the Patient Activation Measure, describing people's knowledge, skill, and confidence in managing their own health."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":198,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"exposure","description":"Exposure to social distancing due to COVID-19"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient Activation Measure (PAMÂ®)","description":"The PAM is a self-reported validated, licensed tool to measure a patient's knowledge, skills and confidence for self-management. The overall score captures the extent to which people feel engaged and confident in taking care of their health condition. It consists of 13 statements rated on a Likert scale according to agreement. Scores are divided into 4 levels, where 1 represents patients who tend to be passive and feel overwhelmed managing their own health, and 4 represents patients who have effectively adopted self-management behaviors.
