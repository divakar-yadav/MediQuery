Group 1 (control) - treatment as usual (TAU). Group 2 - Self-monitoring only (Se-MO). Group 3 - Self-monitoring and self-management (Se-Man).\n\nPrimary outcome: Number reaching target Ambulatory BP levels at follow-up and change in mean Ambulatory BP levels between baseline and follow-up at 6 months.\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNumber of changes in anti-hypertensive treatment during study Side-effects profiles and adverse events BP variability Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) changes All cause and cause-specific mortality outcome at six month Recurrent TIA or stroke Incident CVD- stroke, TIA and myocardial infarction Costs Health related quality of life assessed Quality Adjusted Life Years (EQ-5D based) Patient satisfaction and experience of the process (qualitative data)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Blood pressure monitoring","self BP monitoring","self BP management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":165,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard BP management","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will continue to receive routine measurement of BP and management of treatment from their General Practitioner (GP).","interventionNames":["Other: Standard BP management"]},{"label":"Self BP measurement and standard care","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group (Se-Mo) will be taught to use a validated British Hypertension Society (BHS) approved home BP monitor (with built in memory/printer) by the study nurse along with written information on the procedure and a copy of the BHS Home BP Monitoring DVD.
