Patients will be explored with the multi-b diffusion sequence on a new 3T research magnet equipped with high gradient system. In this project the investigators hypothesize that diffusion MRI at high and ultra-high b-values could be sensitive enough to quantify selective neuronal loss in the rescued penumbra and to study its relationship with the initial hypoperfusion and its impact in terms of clinical recovery.","detailedDescription":"Thrombectomy has significantly improved the outcome of stroke patients. However, even after successful recanalization residual handicap including post-stroke cognitive and mood disorders impact the quality of life of patients. These symptoms correlate only moderately with the final stroke volume suggesting more widespread dysfunction than what is apparent on standard follow-up MRI. One hypothesis is that the rescued penumbra (i.e.; the tissue showing significant hypoperfusion at the acute stage but that appears normal on conventional imaging at follow up) could exhibit incomplete ischemic injury also known under the term of selective neuronal loss. The concept of selective neuronal loss in the rescued penumbra is admitted based on histological, animal and PET studies but the identification of such a graduation between pan-necrosis and normal tissue is very challenging to capture in vivo with MRI and is typically missed.\n\nThis study will prospectively include 100 stroke patients. Patients admitted with significant penumbra at the acute stage and successfully recanalized thanks to thrombectomy thrombolysis or spontaneously will be explored at 24h-to-72h and then at 3 months with the multi-b diffusion sequence. The investigators expect to be able to measure significant modifications within the rescued penumbra as compared to contralateral normal brain by using the advanced but also the simplified diffusion metrics. Investigators will test the impact of duration/severity of the initial hypoperfusion and they will explore the clinical relevance especially in terms of cognitive and mood disorders as measured at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","High b-value diffusion MRI","Rescued penumbra","Selective neuronal loss."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MRI protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For stroke patients, the follow-up MRI (named MRI-2) after successfully recanalized thanks to thrombectomy, intravenous thrombolysis or spontaneously, will be performed between 24h and 72h after recanalization on our new Canon 3T research magnet with high gradient system.
