Both macroscopic and microscopic changes of the brain and the spinal cord will be examined in stroke patients and compared to healthy controls. In terms of structural plasticity, we aim to identify MR biomarkers that allow predicting the course of the patient's neurological status and accurately describe the course of the disease and the recovery. Importantly, we aim to investigate which factors scale the patients' symptoms.\n\nIn terms of functional plasticity, we will combine fMRI with behavioural motor and sensory testing to understand i) the structural and functional interplay between spinal and supraspinal neural circuits after stroke possibly driven by beneficial plasticity/regeneration vs. maladaptive plasticity/degeneration and ii) which clinical and behavioural determinants drive functional hand representations in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices to be maintained and which determinants drive reorganisation of functional representations following sensory input loss. We will further investigate the contribution of brainstem reorganisation to plasticity observed at the cortical level and, by doing so, aim to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of functional reorganisation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: MRI"]},{"label":"Healthy subjects","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"MRI","description":"We will examine chronic (\\>3 months post stroke) patients using functional, structural, and metabolic MRI in both the brain and the spinal cord.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with stroke"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"MRI","description":"We will examine healthy control participants using functional, structural, and metabolic MRI in both the brain and the spinal cord.","armGroupLabels":["Healthy subjects"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameter","description":"Structural characteristics in the brain and spinal cord are assessed in chronic stroke patients using conventional MRI and compared to healthy controls","timeFrame":"Up to 50 weeks]"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) parameter","description":"Metabolic parameter are assessed in chronic stroke patients using MRS in the brain and spinal cord and compared to healthy controls","timeFrame":"Up to 50 weeks"},{"measure":"Functional MRI (fMRI) parameter","description":"Brain activity or change of brain activities between 2 to 5 time points is assessed using fMRI during resting-state or a specific task in chronic stroke patients and compared to healthy controls","timeFrame":"Up to 50 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria - Patients:\n\n* Age 18-80\n* Stroke (\\> 3months)\n* Signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria - Patients:\n\n* Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging\n* Neurological impairment of body function impairments not induced by stroke\n* BMI \\> 40\n* Pregnancy\n* Claustrophobia\n\nInclusion Criteria - Healthy subjects:\n\n* Age 18-80\n* Signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria - Healthy subjects:\n\n* Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging\n* Pregnancy\n* Neurological illness\n* Impairment of body function induced by stroke\n* Claustrophobia\n* BMI \\>40","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with stroke and healthy subjects.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Simon Schading, MMed","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+41 44 510 72 08","email":"simon.schading@balgrist.ch"},{"name":"Sanne Kikkert","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+41 44 633 27 15","email":"sanne.kikkert@balgrist.ch"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Armin Curt, Dr.","affiliation":"University of Zurich","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universitätsklinik Balgrist","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Zürich","zip":"8008","country":"Switzerland","contacts":[{"name":"Simon Schading, MMed","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+41 44 510 72 08","email":"simon.schading@balgrist.ch"},{"name":"Sanne Kikkert","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+41 44 633 27 15","email":"sanne.kikkert@balgrist.ch"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.36667,"lon":8.54999}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
