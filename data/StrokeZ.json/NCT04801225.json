The purpose of the EFS is to evaluate initial clinical safety and device functionality in the clinical workflow setting for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients that will inform design modifications and/or user interface in preparation for next steps consisting of (1) a full safety/feasibility clinical study and (2) randomized controlled pivotal trial with a surrogate endpoint (expedited Premarket Approval (PMA) pathway)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VItalFlow Stimulation Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Enrolled subjects shall receive a VitalFlow stimulation after other standard-of-care treatments are initiated. VitalFlow treatment is initiated by powering on the System and positioning the two (Left and Right) VItalFlow coils on each side of the head (by the ear).\n\nThe operator controls the VItalFlow Stimulation through the accompanying console with simple button operation. Once treatment is initiated, the VitalFlow provides continuous, biphasic pulses at a preset power cycle with the total treatment time under 5 min (fixed time). After treatment is completed, the coils are removed and replaced on the VitalFlow System.","interventionNames":["Device: Non-invasive electromagnetic stimulation for acute stroke treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Non-invasive electromagnetic stimulation for acute stroke treatment","description":"Bilateral electromagnetic stimulation to improve blood flow in ischemic regions of acute stroke as an adjunct to current standard-of-care","armGroupLabels":["VItalFlow Stimulation Treatment"],"otherNames":["Nervive VitalFlow Stimulator","VitalFlow"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of device-related adverse events","description":"Rate of device-related adverse events","timeFrame":"90 days post-procedure"},{"measure":"Feasibility of device use in the Clinical Environment as assessed by User Survey","description":"To demonstrate feasibility, device must have been able to be setup, deployed, and administer treatment without significant difficulty for each study subject, as recorded by the Investigator on the User Survey.","timeFrame":"1-7 days post-procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Exploratory - Rate of change in core volume as measured by Computed Tomography Perfusion","description":"Change in core volumes as measured by CTP at pre-stimulation vs 2-4 hours post-stimulation.
