This deficit can severely restrict functional ability and independence. Recovery of hand function following stroke is highly variable. In this study, the investigators will use brain imaging to predict individual response to treatment. Survivors of stroke will receive upper extremity therapy while they concurrently receive imperceptible vibration to the wrist aimed to enhance therapy outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The ability to predict individuals' responses to treatment can enable effective allocation of a treatment to likely responders. The long-term goal is to determine whether acute changes in brain functional connectivity immediately after one treatment session can predict ultimate gains in motor function after completing multiple treatment sessions. The objective of this study is to determine feasibility and to examine association between change in brain functional connectivity after one session and motor gains after completion of all treatment sessions. This study is a prospective single-cohort longitudinal study. The treatment is task-practice therapy (3d/wk, 18-session) accompanied with concurrent imperceptible wrist vibration that is intended to prime the cortical sensorimotor network and enhance hand functional recovery in chronic stroke survivors. Hand function will be assessed before/after therapy and at 1-month follow-up. Connectivity will be assessed using fMRI and EEG before and after a treatment session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand Function","Occupational Therapy","Physical Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"therapy + vibration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Imperceptible vibration applied to the wrist during a standardized hand task practice therapy program.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: task-practice therapy","Other: Vibration"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"task-practice therapy","description":"Standardized hand therapy program","armGroupLabels":["therapy + vibration"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Vibration","description":"Peripheral vibration applied to the wrist skin at an imperceptible level","armGroupLabels":["therapy + vibration"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Change in Hand Motor Function","description":"Change in hand motor function as measured by the Box and Block Test.
