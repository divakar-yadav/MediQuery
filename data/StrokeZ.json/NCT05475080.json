The factors associated with recurrences and the appropriate treatment to prevent them are currently unknown.\n\nMain objective:\n\nTo compare recurrences of ischemic stroke (cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack) in patients with CW according to the preventive treatment.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* To describe the frequency of recurrences in patients with stroke and CW.\n* To compare the risk of complications, especially hemorrhagic complications, in patients with stroke and CW according to the type of preventive treatment given.\n* To describe the clinical and radiological characteristics of CW and identify which are associated with recurrences.\n* To detect genetic polymorphisms associated with the presence of CW in stroke patients.\n\nStudy design:\n\nMulticenter, prospective registry of consecutive cases with ischemic stroke in which a Carotid Web is detected between 2022 and 2024.\n\nAll patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and age \\> or = 18 years, in whom a Carotid Web is diagnosed, will be included. Demographic and clinical variables, genetic study (not mandatory), diagnostic methods of CW, reperfusion treatment and secondary prevention will be collected. During a minimum follow-up of six months, vascular events (stroke, transient ischemic accidents, cerebral hemorrhages) and treatments (antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, endarterectomy, endovascular therapy) will be collected.\n\nOnce the registry has been completed, the frequency of recurrences and the factors associated with them will be analyzed.\n\nStudy population:\n\nPatients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in whom a Carotid Web is detected. It is estimated to obtain data from approximately 100 patients.\n\nVariables:\n\nDemographic, clinical (past medical history, stroke characteristics), radiological (diagnostic method of CW, morphological characteristics of CW), therapeutic (preventive treatment initiated) and prognostic variables will be collected. Recurrences in the form of stroke or transient ischemic attack (main variable) will be collected during a minimum follow-up of six months. Cerebral hemorrhages, mortality and therapeutic changes during follow-up will also be collected.\n\nEthical considerations:\n\nThis is an observational registry, with no changes in the management or treatment of the patients included, and with an anonymized data registry. Written informed consent will be requested from the patient or his/her representative for participation in the registry and for obtaining a blood sample for the genetic study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Carotid Web"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Antiplatelet","interventionNames":["Drug: Antiplatelet Drug"]},{"label":"Anticoagulant","interventionNames":["Drug: Anticoagulant"]},{"label":"Endovascular","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular"]},{"label":"Surgical (endarterectomy)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Surgery"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Antiplatelet Drug","description":"Any antiplatelet drug or combination","armGroupLabels":["Antiplatelet"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anticoagulant","description":"Any anticoagulante","armGroupLabels":["Anticoagulant"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular","description":"Angioplasty +- stent","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Surgery","description":"Endarterectomy","armGroupLabels":["Surgical (endarterectomy)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ischemic Recurrences","description":"Stroke or TIA","timeFrame":"At least 6 months of follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and\n* Age \\> or = 18 years.\n* Carotid Web diagnosed by angioCT, angioMRI or arteriography.\n* Consent to participate from patient or representative\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No informed consent obtained","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and an age \\> or = 18 years, in whom a CW is diagnosed during the etiological study, will be included.\n\nA CW will be defined by the presence of a focal and homogeneous intraluminal protrusion (shelf-like), without calcific component, located in the posterior or postero-lateral wall of the proximal internal carotid artery or carotid bulb.
