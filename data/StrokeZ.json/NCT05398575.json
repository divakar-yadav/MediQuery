During the past two decades, music interventions have increasingly shown effectiveness in several motor tasks in stroke rehabilitation. Additionally, music has been found effective in increasing exercise performance in athletes and other clinical populations. Based on a meta-theoretical review paper by Clark, Baker \\& Taylor (2016), it was hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of music in physical exercise is modulated by the preference and task-specificity of the music. We will test this hypothesis using a three-armed randomized cross-over design comprised of the following auditory conditions: 1) a group-tailored playlist 2) radio as active control and 3) a non-music control condition during cycle ergometry cardiorespiratory exercise sessions. Participants are inpatient stroke survivors undergoing rehabilitation between 2-12 weeks post infarct."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard treatment with tailored music playlist","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Music playlist tailored for a group of 5-8 individuals.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Music"]},{"label":"Standard treatment with radio music","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Listening to local radio channel with music","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Music"]},{"label":"Standard treatment without music","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard physiotherapy with no audio intervention"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Music","description":"Participants listen to music during physiotherapy rehabilitation (tailored or radio music)","armGroupLabels":["Standard treatment with radio music","Standard treatment with tailored music playlist"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Heart rate reserve","description":"Time spent in therapeutic heart rate zone","timeFrame":"Proportion of time during the 30 minutes session"},{"measure":"Exercise time","description":"Time spent actively participating in the physiotherapy session","timeFrame":"Proportion of time during the 30 minutes session"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feeling scale","description":"11 point Likert scale rating affective valence (current feeling state)","timeFrame":"Immediately before and after the intervention."},{"measure":"Evaluation of condition","description":"Rating of preferred audio condition on a 10 point Likert scale","timeFrame":"Immediately after the intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* between 2-12 weeks post ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke\n* assessed eligible to participate in cardiorespiratory exercise by the patient's primary physiotherapist and interdisciplinary team -â‰¥18 years old\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* uncontrolled medical contraindications for physical activity\n* severe hearing deficit or cochlear implants\n* severe deficit of both auditory and visual communication not allowing for guiding the patient in the exercise task","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Daniel S Mazhari-Jensen, MA","affiliation":"Aalborg University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"North Denmark Region","city":"Aalborg","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":57.048,"lon":9.9187}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
