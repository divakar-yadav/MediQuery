In the first 2 weeks of SAH, angiographic vasospasm is seen up to 40-70% of patients and causes ischemic deficits in 15-36% of patients.\n\nThe best clinical indicator of significantly reduced brain perfusion (cerebral blood flow (CBF)\\<20 ml per 100 g/min) is the presence of new neurologic deficits. However, clinical symptoms may be vague and mimic other conditions in patients with SAH.\n\nCT Perfusion can be used in the evaluation of patients with possible vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It can thus be used to assess cerebral ischemia and infarction as a result of vasospasm after SAH.\n\nThe presence of cerebral vasospasm identified with transcranial Doppler, digital subtraction angiography, or CT angiography (CTA) is frequently used to confirm DCI. Presence of vasospasm, however, does not prove the presence of ischemia and absence of vasospasm does not rule out. Better diagnostic tests in the acute stage of deterioration, possibly caused by DCI, are therefore needed. In patients with SAH, CTP has recently been shown to be promising for detection of early ischemia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Cerebral Vasospasm","Delayed Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["CT perfusion","Subarachnoid hemorrhage","Vasospasm","Delayed cerebral ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"21 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with poor outcome","description":"Follow up of patients is done for 21 days by combined clinical and radiological examination.
