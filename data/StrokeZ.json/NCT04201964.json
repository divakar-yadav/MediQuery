However, sufficient recanalization (mTICI2b-3) can 't be acquired in all patients under thrombectomy. There is a lack of evidence that whether salvage intra-arterial thrombolysis is beneficial for patients with insufficient recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy. The EXTEND-IA TNK study indicated that tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and better functional outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. This study intends to explore the proportion of sufficient recanalization (2b/3) after intra-arterial tenecteplase administration in patients undergoing thrombectomy with insufficient recanalization (1/2a)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase (0.2-0.4 mg/min) immediately after thrombectomy device pass for 30-40 minutes.","interventionNames":["Drug: Intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase","description":"Intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase (0.2-0.4 mg/min) immediately after thrombectomy device pass for 30-40 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of sufficient recanalization","description":"sufficient recanalization is defined as TICI 2b-3","timeFrame":"immediately after local TNK treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of favorable outcome","description":"favorable outcome is defined as mRS 0-2","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"proportion of early neurological improvement","description":"early neurological improvement is defined as more than 4 decrease in NIHSS","timeFrame":"48 hours"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"incidence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage","description":"intracranial haemorrhage is defined as more than 4 increase in NIHSS caused by intracranial bleeding","timeFrame":"48 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
