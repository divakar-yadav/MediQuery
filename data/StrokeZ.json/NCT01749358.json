The investigators are testing the dosage of therapy that is needed for meaningful recovery of arm and hand function. Dosage of therapy refers to the amount of time (in this case, the total number of hours) that a person participates in treatment. The investigators hope to learn how much therapy time is needed in order for change to occur in arm and hand function after a person has had a stroke. Eligible candidates must have had a stroke affecting the use of an arm or hand at least 6 months ago."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Ischemia","Infarction"],"keywords":["stroke","hemiparesis","physical therapy","occupational therapy","neurorehabilitation","patient focused","motor learning","motor control","skill acquisition","skill training","motor recovery","task oriented training","task specific training","arm function","hand function","upper extremity","arm therapy","physical rehabilitation","arm rehabilitation","motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Therapy Dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sixty total hours of ASAP therapy--challenging, intensive and meaningful practice of tasks of your choice in a collaborative partnership with your personal trainer (therapist).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP)"]},{"label":"Moderate Therapy Dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Thirty total hours of ASAP therapy--challenging, intensive and meaningful practice of tasks of your choice in a collaborative partnership with your personal trainer (therapist).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP)"]},{"label":"Low Therapy Dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fifteen total hours of ASAP therapy--challenging, intensive and meaningful practice of tasks of your choice in a collaborative partnership with your personal trainer (therapist).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP)"]},{"label":"Active Monitoring","type":"OTHER","description":"This is an observation only group.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Active Monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP)","description":"A focused, intense, evidence-based, upper extremity rehabilitation program.
