As the golden standard, aspirin effect modestly on acute ischemic stroke, and slightly increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Recently, edoxaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants, while carrying significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nThis trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial in China. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that a 30-days edoxaban regimen is superior to aspirin alone for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular event."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemia","Stroke","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["edoxaban","aspirin","new oral anticoagulant","TIA","acute minor ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3700,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Receiving a 100-mg dose of aspirin and placebo edoxaban from day 1 to day 30","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin","Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"edoxaban 30mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving a 30-mg dose of edoxaban and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 30","interventionNames":["Drug: edoxaban","Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"edoxaban 60mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving a 60-mg dose of edoxaban and placebo aspirin from day 1 to day 30","interventionNames":["Drug: edoxaban","Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","armGroupLabels":["aspirin"],"otherNames":["Acetylsalicylic acid"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"edoxaban","description":"orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["edoxaban 30mg","edoxaban 60mg"],"otherNames":["DU176b","LIXIANA TABLETS"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","armGroupLabels":["aspirin","edoxaban 30mg","edoxaban 60mg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage)","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of patients with new clinical vascular events (ischemic stroke/hemorrhagic stroke/TIA/myocardial infarction/vascular death)","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"mRS score changes (continuous) and dichotomized at percentage with score 0 to 2 versus 3 to 6","timeFrame":"30 days and 90 days"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS scores","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"moderate to severe bleeding events","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Total mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Adverse events/severe adverse events reported by the investigators","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult subjects (male or female ≥18 years old)\n* Acute nondisabling ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤3 at the time of randomization) that can be treated with study drug within 24 hours of symptoms onset.
