Patients will be screened and evaluated on Visits 1 to assess their eligibility prior to randomization. The treatment period (Visit 1-6) will last 12 months and the patient will receive initial and follow-up evaluation (section 4.5) including history and physical examinations, and baseline and end of treatment ABI and carotid IMT assessments. Vascular events and death as well as adverse events including bleeding complications will also be recorded at intervals as detailed in section 4.5."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":801,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cilostazol","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pletaal® (Cilostazol) 100 mg, bid p.o.","interventionNames":["Drug: Cilostazol"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo\n\n1 tablet, bid p.o.","interventionNames":["Other: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cilostazol","description":"100 mg, bid p.o.","armGroupLabels":["Cilostazol"],"otherNames":["Pletaal®"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"placebo","description":"1 tablet, bid","armGroupLabels":["placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary endpoint for this study is slowdown of PAD progression based on ABI.","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Carotid intima-media thickness","description":"1.
