The safety and efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in ABAO remains uncertain due to inconsistent evidence from random controlled trials (RCTs).\n\nRecent studies have explored the use of MRI in ABAO, this study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of EVT and standard medical therapy (SMT) in the treatment of ABAO within 24 hours of onset. It also aims to explore the feasibility and prognostic value of MRI-based assessment of ABAO infarction using AI image analysis software."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["MRI","Endovascular Thrombectomy","Standard Medical Therapy","Large Vessel Occlusion","Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular Thrombectomy","description":"For patients who onset within 4.5 hours and meet the criteria for intravenous thrombolysis treatment, they could receive intravenous thrombolysis treatment beforehand and bridging to endovascular therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Standard Medical Therapy","description":"For patients who onset within 4.5 hours and met the criteria for intravenous thrombolysis treatment, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or urokinase, and other intravenous thrombolysis therapies should be pre-administrated."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Mechanical Thrombectomy","description":"The endovascular mechanical thrombectomy methods mainly include stent retriever thrombectomy, ADAPT thrombus aspiration technique, or their combination.","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular Thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-3 at 90 days","description":"The mRS score range from 0 (no disability) to 6 (death)","timeFrame":"90 days after EVT or SMT"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality","description":"Death defined as a mRS score of 6","timeFrame":"90 days after EVT or SMT"},{"measure":"Rate of mRS score of 0-2","description":"The mRS score range from 0 (no disability) to 6 (death)","timeFrame":"90 days after EVT or SMT"},{"measure":"Improvement of mRS score","description":"The mRS score range from 0 (no disability) to 6 (death)\n\nThe mRS score range from 0 (no disability) to 6 (death)","timeFrame":"90 days after EVT or SMT"},{"measure":"Change of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score comparing to baseline","description":"The NIHSS score range from 0 (no deficit) to 42 (maximum deficit).","timeFrame":"24 hours and 5-7 days (or at discharge) after EVT"},{"measure":"Rate of successful revascularization (mTICI 2b-3) in target blood vessels of EVT group","timeFrame":"Immediately after the completion of endovascular therapy."},{"measure":"Rate of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)","timeFrame":"Within 72 hours after EVT or SMT"},{"measure":"Rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"The sICH was assessed based on the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification, defined as 1) ≥4 points total NIHSS at the time of diagnosis compared to immediately before worsening; 2) ≥2 point in one NIHSS category.
