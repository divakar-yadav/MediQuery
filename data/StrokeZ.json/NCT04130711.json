Electroencephalogram (EEG) Neurofeedback is a re-education technique that improves cerebral plasticity and motor gain in these people during the chronic phase of stroke. The visual feedback usually used tends to diminish the subject's attentional resources, while the proprioceptive feedbacks appear to be more effective on cortical excitability. Vibration feedback inducing movement illusion has been shown to be effective in healthy subjects, but has not been tested in people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","neurofeedback","tendon vibration","virtual reality","haptic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TEST 1: Visual virtual Conditions","type":"OTHER","description":"* 50 subjects (30 healthy volunteers and 20 patients after stroke)\n* 3 different situations of vibration applications, without EGG neurofeedback session","interventionNames":["Other: Visual virtual Conditions"]},{"label":"TEST 2: Standard EEG","type":"OTHER","description":"* 20 subjects (healthy volunteers)\n* 3 separate electroencephalographic recording conditions without Neurofeedback","interventionNames":["Other: Standard EEG"]},{"label":"TEST 3: Neurofeedback Training Stroke Patients","type":"OTHER","description":"* 26 patients after stroke\n* 12 neurofeedback sessions spread over 6 weeks according to the feedback modality that will be drawn (visual or visuo-vibratory)","interventionNames":["Other: Neurofeedback Training Stroke Patients"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Visual virtual Conditions","description":"The objective is to evaluate if certain virtual visual conditions can increase the illusion of movement induced by the tendon vibration of the upper limb.\n\nThirty healthy volunteers and 20 post-stroke subjects will test 3 different situations of vibration applications, with no EEG Neurofeedback session.
