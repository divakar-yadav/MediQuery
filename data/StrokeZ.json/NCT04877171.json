Several studies had demonstrated that patients benefit by implementing telestroke, for instance, providing timely and appropriate neurological consultation, diminishing accessible barriers, improving medication adherence for secondary prevention and facilitating linkages between patient and physician, especially for those in rural or neurologically underserved areas.\n\nHypothesis: The use of Telemedicine improves medication adherence in Post-ischemic Stroke.\n\nStudy Design: This is a randomized, single-blind, clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Telemedicine, over medication adherence in Post-ischemic Stroke subjects from Colombia.\n\nPopulation: Eighty-four Post-ischemic Stroke subjects, subjects of both genders, over 18 years old, with a first stroke will be included.\n\nEthical Aspects: The study will be conducted according to the Helsinki declaration, the good clinical practices guidelines and the Colombian legislation. Prior to entering the study, patients must sign a written or oral informed consent that has been approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia.\n\nOverall objective: this study aims to determine the efficacy of telemedicine on pharmacological adherence in post-ischemic Stroke Participants.\n\nFocus of study: Adherence to secondary stroke prevention medication."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Compliance, Patient","Compliance, Treatment","Compliance, Medication"],"keywords":["Stroke consultation","Telemedicine","Recovery","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"telemedicine neurology consultation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Starting on day 12-14 post-discharge, participants will receive a phone call for a drug conciliation.
