The registry was used to document global baseline characteristics, current treatment strategies and outcome measures. Characterisation of a number of AF sub-populations was also completed. GARFIELD-AF is an independent academic research initiative sponsored by the Thrombosis Research Institute (London, UK) and supported by an unrestricted research grant from Bayer AG (Berlin, Germany).","detailedDescription":"Using data from more than 1000 randomly selected centres across 35 countries, representing all possible care settings, the registry will help to characterize real-life anticoagulant treatment patterns and outcomes, including rates of stroke and bleeding complications, as well as provide data on other important issues, such as physicians' compliance with guidelines and patients' adherence to therapy. This is particularly timely as standard practice moves away from vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-dominated therapy and towards a new era of novel oral anticoagulants (OACs), i.e. direct Factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nTo ensure a dataset that truly reflects current practice, the investigators are requested to prospectively enrol all newly diagnosed patients with non-valvular AF who have at least one additional investigator-determined risk factor for stroke. Patients are consecutively recruited into one of five cohorts and followed up for at least 2 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial
