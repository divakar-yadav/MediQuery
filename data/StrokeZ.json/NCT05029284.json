Few interventions are designed to reduce post-stroke sedentary time.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to test whether the teleABLE (Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement) Intervention is feasible and acceptable to adults within the first 12 months post-stroke. The hypothesis is that teleABLE can be feasibly delivered using videoconferencing within the first 12 months post-stroke. 10 participants will complete assessments and activity monitoring (activPAL micro3) at 0 (baseline) and 8 (post-intervention)-weeks. Participants will complete 12 sessions of the teleABLE intervention.\n\nFindings from this study will be used to guide the intervention protocol in the planned next phase of this research."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"teleABLE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will complete 12 teleABLE sessions via videoconferencing, guided by an intervention therapist and participant workbook.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: teleABLE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"teleABLE","description":"Participants will be guided to self-monitor their daily activities, schedule personally meaningful non-sedentary activities, collaboratively problem solve to overcome barriers to the activity, and self-assess their progress.
