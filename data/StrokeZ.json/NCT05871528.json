Multicenter observational studies suggest that amyloid angiopathy may be one of the main risk factors for remote hemorrhage. Currently, it is unknown what happens to those patients with remote hemorrhage beyond 3 months of follow-up in terms of risk/benefit balance when receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, as well as from a cognitive point of view. Considering an analogy with amyloid angiopathy, the hypothesis is that those patients with remote hemorrhage have a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage during follow-up when receiving stroke secondary prevention, and will also present greater cognitive deterioration during long-term follow-up.\n\nMain Objectives\n\n* To explore the frequency and risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage during follow-up of patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage.\n* To explore the frequency and progression of cognitive deterioration during follow-up in patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nMethodology Observational, prospective, multicenter registry with a population-based case-control design of consecutive patients with remote hemorrhage following reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke. Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of ischemic stroke with age greater than or equal to 18 years who has remote cerebral hemorrhage after receiving reperfusion therapy in the acute phase. Exclusion criteria: Lack of basic data (age, sex, neuroimaging data) or telephone for follow-up. The cases will be those patients with remote hemorrhage. For each case included, 4 consecutive controls will be included (2 with local parenchymal hemorrhagic transformation and 2 without hemorrhagic transformation). The data will be filled out within the (Codi Ictus de CATalunya) CICAT registry form (currently mandatory in all stroke centers in Catalonia) to which additional variables will be added. Telephone follow-up will be conducted at 3, 12, and 24 months.\n\nMain study variable:\n\n* Any type of spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage during a 24-month follow-up.\n* Score on the \"Short Informant Questionnaire\" scale (a validated 17-question questionnaire to be conducted over the phone, where a score higher than 57 points indicates cognitive impairment).\n\nExpected sample size during a 2-year recruitment period: 105-300 patients (considering the participating centers to date).\n\nAdditional information. This study is endorsed by the \"Pla Director de la Malaltia Vascular Cerebral\" in Catalonia.\n\nParticipating Centers. Participation offers have been sent to the 28 hospitals in the hospital network of Catalonia with the capacity to administer intravenous fibrinolysis. Positive responses have been received from 13 of them so far. In case the project is accepted by the (Comité Ético de Investigación Clínica) CEIC Sant Pau, the centers that have not responded will be contacted again to obtain their participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Intracranial Hemorrhages","Hemorrhagic Transformation Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Thrombolysis","Hemorrhagic transformation stroke","Secondary prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No hemorrhagic transformation","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis and no hemorrhagic transformation (IH1 or IH2 are allowed)"},{"label":"Local hemorragic transformation","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis and hemorrhagic transformation PH1 or PH2"},{"label":"Remote hemorrhage","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis and remote hemorrhage in areas without evident ischemia (rPH)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Explore the frequency and risk factors of intracranial hemorrhage during follow-up in patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage","description":"Describe the frequency, rate and adjusted hazard ratio","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Explore the frequency of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, and any cerebrovascular event in patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage.","description":"Describe the frequency, rate and adjusted hazard ratio","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Investigate the net benefit of preventive treatment in patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage (composite of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage).","description":"Evaluate the rate and adjusted hazard ratio of ischemic and hemorrhagic events","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Explore the socio-functional status of patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage using the modified Rankin Scale during follow-up.","description":"Describe the proportion of patients with favorable functional outcome measured with modified Rankin Scale (favorable is the score is 0-2)","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Explore vascular mortality and overall mortality in patients with remote cerebral hemorrhage during follow-up.","description":"Describe the frequency, rate and adjusted hazard ratio","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Explore cognitive impairment follow-up","description":"IQCODE brief test \\>56 points","timeFrame":"24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

The first step is to identify cases by evaluating control neuroimaging, and if there are doubts, investigators can seek consensus decision-making. The second step is to select four controls for each case, two without hemorrhagic transformation and two with type 2 hemorrhagic transformation. The third step involves completing the CICAT registry form and additional variables, some of which are optional. The fourth and final step is to conduct telephone follow-up at 3, 12, and 24 months to collect variables of interest in relation to the study's objectives.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Luis Prats Sanchez, MD PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34935565986","email":"lpratss@santpau.cat"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Luis Prats Sanchez, MD PhD","affiliation":"Fundació Institut de Recerca de l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Barcelona","state":"Cataluña","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Luis Prats-Sanchez, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34935565986","email":"lpratss@santpau.cat"},{"role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34935565986"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000020300","term":"Intracranial Hemorrhages"},{"id":"D000002543","term":"Cerebral Hemorrhage"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000006470","term":"Hemorrhage"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11997","name":"Neoplasm Metastasis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9246","name":"Hemorrhage","asFound":"Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5482","name":"Cerebral Hemorrhage","asFound":"Cerebral Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21803","name":"Intracranial Hemorrhages","asFound":"Intracranial Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
