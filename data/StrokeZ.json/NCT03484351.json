Falls not only lead to injuries such as broken hips, but they may also lead to fear of falling. As a consequence people can get fearful to walk, keep up their household tasks and their social activities such as visiting friends and family.\n\nResearch has shown that exercises for strength and balance can help both older people and patients after stroke to get fitter and healthier and help to prevent them from having a fall. People also have less falls if they have learned about falls facts and home safety precautions. Research has further suggested that people have less fear of falling and less injuries from a fall if they have learned how to fall ('safe landing' strategies). Based on these research findings the researchers have developed a new falls prevention programme called the Fall Monty Activity Programme (FallMAP). This programme aims to aid in functional recovery and reduce falls by combining a mix of activities such as falls education, strength and balance exercises, and activities that teach people how to get up from the floor and how to fall safely.\n\nEspecially because people with residual impairments following a stroke have an increased risk of a fall, the feasibility of this programme will be tested in a small group of people after stroke first. This study is a first step in establishing whether the different components of the FallMAP are acceptable and practical for both patients after stroke and staff who deliver the program. In particular, it is important to evaluate if it is feasible to provide the seven combined components as one comprehensive programme. Secondly, the question whether participating in the programme can positively influence the participants' fear of falling, quality of life, leg strength, balance and mobility will be explored. If this feasibility study suggests the programme can work in the clinical setting, then a definitive randomised controlled trial will be proposed in order to look at whether the full programme is effective at reducing falls in patients after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Falls"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fall Monty Activity Programme (FallMAP)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A multifactorial falls prevention activity programme","interventionNames":["Other: Fall Monty Activity Programme (FallMAP)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Fall Monty Activity Programme (FallMAP)","description":"The programme delivered during this feasibility study will consist of a total of 12 multifactorial falls prevention group exercise sessions of 90-100 minutes in duration, followed by a 20-30 minute social activity.
