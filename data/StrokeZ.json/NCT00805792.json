The hypothesis is that taking donepezil (FDA-approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease) for the first 90 days following a stroke enhances recovery.","detailedDescription":"We hypothesize that donepezil (5 mg per day, titrated up to 10 mg per day as tolerated) will enhance recovery following stroke by improving attention, learning and memory thereby enhancing rehabilitation. The null hypothesis is that the probability of a favorable outcome among post-stroke donepezil users is equal to that observed among similar participants in an existing National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) resource, the Phase III clinical trial of Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke. The NINDS tPA stroke trial has been used as historical control data in pilot trials of reperfusion and neuroprotection.\n\nThe MASTER trial will be a multicenter, single-arm NINDS Recominant tPA trial-controlled, modified 2-stage adaptive clinical trial set in 2 tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Participants will be men and women with acute (\\< 24 hours of onset of symptoms) ischemic stroke. A favorable outcome will be defined as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) values of 0 or 1 at 90 days post-stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","treatment","recovery","donepezil","Aricept"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Donepezil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants received treatment with donepezil within 24 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms.
