This study will collect normal values of leg muscle peak force production, cumulative peak force production, and sustained peak force production in patients with chronic stroke.","detailedDescription":"The Activbody Activ5 device will be used for data collection with all information logged and stored through the device's app and transferred to secure files. Assessment of isometric muscle strength and power will be performed as follows:\n\n* Hip flexors with the participant seated and hips and knees flexed at 90 degrees\n* Knee extensors with the participant seated and hips and knees flexed at 90 degrees\n* Knee flexors with the participant seated and hips and knees flexed at 90 degrees\n* Ankle plantarflexors with the participant lying supine with the ankle in plantargrade and hips and knees extended\n* Ankle dorsiflexors with the participant lying supine with the ankle relaxed and hips and knees extended\n* Hip abductors with the participant lying supine and hips and knees extended\n* Hip adductors with the participant lying supine and hips and knees extended\n* Hip extensors with the participant lying prone and hips and knees extended 1 session, two trials per side"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke","Weakness, Muscle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Average Force Production","description":"Average force production of bilateral lower extremities will be collected using the handheld dynamometer, Activbody Activ5."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hand-held Dynamometry Measurement of Average Force Production","description":"Average force production of lower extremity isometric strength measured in pounds (lb)","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hand-held Dynamometry Measurement of Peak Force Production","description":"Peak force production of lower extremity isometric strength measured in pounds (lb)","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hand-held Dynamometry Measurement of Time to Peak Force","description":"Time required to reach peak force production of lower extremity isometric strength measured in seconds (sec)","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 years or older\n* Stroke \\> 3 months\n* Ability to follow two-step commands\n* Ability to assume all test positions and maintain for duration of testing (i.e. upright seated, prone, side lying, supine)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Lower extremity contractures preventing full passive range of motion (ROM)\n* Vital signs contraindicated for exercise (i.e. resting heart rate \\> 100 bpm \\< 50 bpm, resting systolic blood pressure \\> 200 mmHg or \\< 90 mmHg, resting diastolic blood pressure \\> 110 mmHg, oxygen saturation \\< 90%)\n* Symptoms contraindicated for testing (i.e. shortness of breath, angina, dizziness, severe headache, sudden onset of numbness or weakness, painful calf suggestive of deep vein thrombosis)\n* Active infection and/or injury at location of testing site\n* Other diagnosed co-morbidities that would impact physical participation","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Age 18 years or older\n\n- Stroke \\> 3 months","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Cathey Norton","role":"CONTACT","phone":"615-460-6715","email":"cathey.norton@belmont.edu"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Nashville","state":"Tennessee","zip":"37209-2069","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Cathey Norton, PT, DPT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"615-460-6715","email":"cathey.norton@vumc.org"},{"name":"Cathey Norton","role":"CONTACT","phone":"615-460-6715","email":"cathey.norton@belmont.edu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":36.16589,"lon":-86.78444}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"12589633","type":"RESULT","citation":"Andrews AW, Bohannon RW.
