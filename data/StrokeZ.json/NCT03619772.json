This impairment is due mainly to the decreased ability to modulate appropriate muscle activation patterns. Issues with appropriately modifying activation patterns can profoundly affect tasks of daily living. This study is evaluating a novel software focusing on retraining hand muscle activation patterns through an Electromyographic (EMG) controlled game. Stroke survivors with chronic, severe hemiparesis of the hand will participate in a longitudinal study consisting of 3 weeks of training. We hypothesize that stroke survivors will experience a decrease in time to complete a test of EMG control, as well as improvement in hand motor control."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Weakness, Muscle","Coordination Lack"],"keywords":["hand","stroke","therapy","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bilateral","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will control game using EMG from both upper limbs.","interventionNames":["Other: Bilateral"]},{"label":"Unilateral","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will control game using the more impaired upper limb.","interventionNames":["Other: Unilateral"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bilateral","description":"Participants will control game using EMG from both upper limbs.","armGroupLabels":["Bilateral"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Unilateral","description":"Participants will control game using EMG from the more impaired upper limb.","armGroupLabels":["Unilateral"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in mean completion time for timed test","description":"Time to complete movement to 16 randomized targets","timeFrame":"Baseline and 3 weeks (immediately post intervention)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Single, unilateral stroke at least 6 months prior to enrollment\n* Moderate hand impairment defined by Stage 4 or Stage 5 on the Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment Scale\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Visual neglect or deficits (with inability to compensate)\n* Upper extremity orthopedic conditions that interfere with movement\n* Cerebellar stroke\n\nChildren, prisoners, or adult unable to provide consent will not be recruited.
