However, an optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen following successful LAAC remains an unresolved issue and may significantly contribute to long-term safety and efficacy. Nowadays LAAC is mainly performed in patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulation due to high bleeding risk. Dialyzed patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation have simultaneously high thromboembolic and bleeding risk. Such patients were excluded from randomized trials and data on the LAAC efficacy in this population is limited thus prospective studies are warranted.\n\nObjective:\n\nSAFE-LAAC CKD Trial has been designed as a comparative health effectiveness study with the following aims:\n\n1. compare the safety and efficacy of 30 days vs. 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy following LAAC with Amplatzer or WATCHMAN device (randomized comparison)\n2. compare the safety and efficacy of stopping all antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents 6 months after LAAC vs. long-term treatment with a single antiplatelet agent (nonrandomized comparison)\n\nPatient population:\n\nPatients (n=80) with the end-stage renal disease treated with chronic haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, after successful LAAC with Amplatzer or WATCHMAN device\n\nPerspective:\n\nResults of this pilot trial will provide: 1. data to aid practitioners and guideline writers recommend the most optimal antithrombotic treatment after LAAC, 2. data on the safety and efficacy of LAAC in dialyzed patients, and 3. data to support power calculations for designing future randomized trials.\n\nMethodology:\n\nSAFE LAAC CKD has been designed as a multicenter (planned contribution of 7 centers in Poland), open-label, comparative health effectiveness trial with central, independent adjudication of events comprising the primary end-point. The first part of the trial is randomized and after 6 months of follow-up continues for another 12 months as a non-randomized study.\n\nTimeline:\n\nThe duration of the trial has been planned for 5 years. The enrollment phase has been planned for 3 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","stroke","bleeding","left atrial
