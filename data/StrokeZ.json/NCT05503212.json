If the two recent ATTENTION and BAOCHE randomized clinical trials have proven the superiority of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in basilar artery occlusions, data on the effectiveness and harm of acute revascularization treatment on isolated VAO is scarce. We aim to investigate the impact of acute recanalisation treatments in acute ischemic stroke patients with isolated VAO.\n\nIn the absence of RCT, observational data with appropriate statistical methods may give indications on benefits and harms of treating neglected stroke situations like acute vertebral occlusion. Results may also lay the basis for prospective studies, such as randomized clinical trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Vertebral Artery Ischemia","Arterial Occlusive Diseases","Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency"],"keywords":["Prognosis","Revascularization","Treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":682,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AIS and isolated VAO","description":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and concomitant isolated intracranial and/or extracranial vertebral artery occlusion (VAO)","interventionNames":["Other: Conservative treatment (CT)","Other: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)","Other: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) ± intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conservative treatment (CT)","description":"Best medical treatment without intravenous thrombolysis nor endovascular thrombectomy","armGroupLabels":["AIS and isolated VAO"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)","description":"Best medical treatment with intravenous thrombolysis but without endovascular thrombectomy","armGroupLabels":["AIS and isolated VAO"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) ± intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)","description":"Best medical treatment with endovascular thrombectomy with or without intravenous thrombolysis","armGroupLabels":["AIS and isolated VAO"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"3-month modified Rankin scale","description":"3-month functional outcome, \\[range: 0-6, 0= no symptoms, 6=death\\]","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH)","description":"Any hemorrhagic transformation temporally related to any worsening in neurological condition. \\[yes/no\\]","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"EVT procedural complications","description":"Any complication attributed to the procedure (vessel perforation, vasospasm, dissection, Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)/Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), device detachment/misplacement, embolization to new territory, access-site complications, early reocclusion, other)","timeFrame":"During EVT procedure or peri-procedural"},{"measure":"24-hour NIHSS","description":"NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).
