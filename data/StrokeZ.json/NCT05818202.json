The insights of stroke patients and physiotherapists were assessed with the quantitative questionnaires. The results were provided as number, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. The results of the insights of the current sapmle were given and compared the previous studies. The authors though that the results of the study can fill the gaps in robotic rehabilitation and support a better robotic rehabilitation experience.","detailedDescription":"Fifty stroke patients and fifty seven physiotherapists included the study. A seventeen-item and eight-item questionnaire s were created for stroke patients and physiotherapists, respectively. The descriptive data of the stroke patients and physiotherapists were presented.
