The investigators have adopted a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach to provide a more integrative perspective using cognitive, social-psychological, biochemical, and neuroimaging measurements.","detailedDescription":"The MindFit Project is a multicentric, prospective, parallel, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a sample of 141 participants at 3 to 60 months after stroke. Participants are randomly allocated to one of three arms (through a simple randomizing procedure with a 1:1:1 ratio created with a random sequence generator software).\n\nThe first group (n=47) receives computer-based cognitive training (CCT) combined with a multicomponent physical exercise program. The second group (n=47) receives CCT combined with mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy. Finally, the third group (n=47), as an active control group, receives only CCT. All interventions last 12 weeks.\n\nWithin two weeks before the start of the interventions, and again at 3 months after completing the interventions, medical, cognitive, and physical assessments, neuroimaging, and biological samples collection are performed.\n\nThe objectives of this project are:\n\n1. To examine the effects of multimodal interventions in a population of chronic stroke patients on various domains: cognition, emotion, physical health, and quality of life.\n2. To examine specific plasticity effects of each of the three interventions regarding structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and how these changes may contribute to cognitive and emotional benefits.\n3. To study the molecular mechanisms by which the different types of interventions influence cognitive, emotional and brain benefits.\n4. To study interventions-induced microbiome changes and to explain how these changes may induce inflammatory and immune responses that may contribute to cognitive, emotional and brain benefits.\n5. To determine the demographic, clinical and genetic factors that may modulate cognitive, emotional and brain changes: baseline cognitive status; baseline cerebral status (atrophy, total intracranial volume); sex; age, educational level, intelligence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Neuroplasticity","stroke","neuroprotection","physical exercise","cognitive training","mindfulness","neuroimaging","intervention","randomization","blind"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"141 participants at 3 to 60 months after stroke are randomly allocated to one of three arms: The first group (n=47) receives computer-based cognitive training (CCT) combined with a multicomponent physical exercise program.

The supervised sessions include exercises to work aerobic capacity, muscle strength and endurance, flexibility, agility, and balance. The intensity of these exercises is prescribed individually according to each participant's initial level and are gradually increased as the program progresses. Participants are encouraged to walk at a similar intensity on autonomous physical exercise days as performed in the guided sessions (moderate intensity), based on the Borg scale of perceived exertion (Borg, 1982).","armGroupLabels":["Physical exercise & cognitive training group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program","description":"This intervention follows an adaptation of the scheme and instructions of the official Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program designed by Jon Kabat-Zinn.
