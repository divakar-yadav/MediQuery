However, the pathophysiology of this treatment remains unknown. Some authors assert that it is effective on spasticity itself, while others suggest that it acts more on fibrosis.\n\nMethod: this study will assess the effectiveness of radial SWT to treat wrist and finger flexors stiffness in stroke patients, comparing subacute spastic patients (\\< 12 months) with chronic patients presenting muscle contractures (\\> 12 months). Forty-eight stroke patients (24 in the subacute phase and 24 in the chronic phase) will be included. One real and one sham sessions of SWT will be performed with a 2-week interval. The order of the sessions will be randomized. Motor control, stiffness and spasticity will be assessed with clinical and objective measures, just after and just before each session, by a blind assessor. The targeted muscles will be flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus, and will be the same for the two session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"interventional group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"group receiving shock wave therapy","interventionNames":["Device: shock wave therapy"]},{"label":"control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham shock wave therapy","interventionNames":["Device: shock wave therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"shock wave therapy","description":"Shockwave therapy is a non-invasive treatment creating a series of low energy acoustic wave pulsations that are directly applied through the skin via a gel medium","armGroupLabels":["control group","interventional group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Clinical assessment of spasticity for wrist and fingers flexors, score from 0 to 4 (a higher score representing a greater spasticity)","timeFrame":"Before (baseline) and 5 minutes (post-treatment) after each of the two sessions (sham or real SWT)"},{"measure":"Tardieu scale","description":"Clinical assessment of spasticity for wrist and fingers flexors;
