While these conditions affect about 25% of stroke patients at 3 months, they are under-reported spontaneously by patients and are under-evaluated and treated by clinicians. Other than stroke severity and psychiatric history, risk factors for post-stroke depression remain a matter of debate, thus preventing identification of high-risk patients. Moreover, to date, neither pharmacological nor nonpharmacological treatments have demonstrated a significant benefit in the prevention of this disorder, thereby also impeding the development of early treatment strategies. Yet,the early management of post-stroke depression is critical given its negative influence on long-term functional outcomes, medication adherence, efficient use of rehabilitation services and the risk of stroke recurrence or vascular events. There is a pressing need to develop new tools allowing for the early detection of post-stroke neuropsychiatric complications for each individual patient. The rapid expansion of ambulatory monitoring techniques, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), allows daily evaluations of mood symptoms in real time and in the natural contexts of daily life. The investigators have previously validated the feasibility and validity of EMA to assess daily life emotional symptoms after stroke, demonstrating its utility to investigate their evolution during the 3 months following stroke and to identify early predictors of post-stroke depression such as stress reactivity and social support, suggesting that EMA could be used in the early personalized care management of these neuropsychiatric complications. Recently, preliminary data have also emphasized the potential of EMA interventions to improve the outcome of psychiatric disorders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression"],"keywords":["Stroke","e-health","Depression","Anxiety","Prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":452,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment As Usual (TAU)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Evaluation of depression and anxiety disorders at 3 and 6 months post-stroke using psychological and functional examination","interventionNames":["Other: Psychological evaluation","Other: Functional evaluation","Biological: Biological assessment"]},{"label":"EMA intervention assocuated to Treatment As Usual (EMA-TAU)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Evaluation of depression and anxiety disorders at 3 and 6 months post-stroke using psychological and functional examination in addition with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) evaluation.","interventionNames":["Other: Psychological evaluation","Other: Functional evaluation","Biological: Biological assessment","Other: Ecological Momentary Assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Psychological evaluation","description":"Psychological evaluation including: MINI (current diagnosis) ; HDRS ; MDQ ; GAD-7 ; PC-PTSD-5 ; Quality of Sleep (item 6 of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) ; CES-D ; BAI ; RRS-short form ; IES-R ; mYFAS2.0;","armGroupLabels":["EMA intervention assocuated to Treatment As Usual (EMA-TAU)","Treatment As Usual (TAU)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Functional evaluation","description":"Functional evaluation including : EQ5-D ; MFI ; LUNS ; SSQ ; Physical activity (IPAQ)","armGroupLabels":["EMA intervention assocuated to Treatment As Usual (EMA-TAU)","Treatment As Usual (TAU)"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Biological assessment","description":"Biological assessment : White and red blood cells count ; platelets count ; Haemoglobin ; CRPus ; Glycaemia ; Plasmatic HbA1c ; Plasmatic LDLc ; HDLc and triglyceride ; Creatinin clearance, Transaminases.","armGroupLabels":["EMA intervention assocuated to Treatment As Usual (EMA-TAU)","Treatment As Usual (TAU)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ecological Momentary Assessment","description":"During 3 months after inclusion, a 3 to 5 minutes daily interview will administer questions concerning mood symptoms, activities, stress experience, substance use, social relationships and medication intake, activities, social interaction, environmental conditions, experience of depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in weight, appetite, sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, concentration or decision-making difficulty","armGroupLabels":["EMA intervention assocuated to Treatment As Usual (EMA-TAU)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (HDRS)","description":"Semi-structured interview questionnaire designed to be used by a health care professional to investigate depressive symptomatology. 17 items are used to provide a score.","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (HDRS)","description":"Semi-structured interview questionnaire designed to be used by a health care professional to investigate depressive symptomatology. 17 items are used to provide a score.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (HDRS)","description":"Semi-structured interview questionnaire designed to be used by a health care professional to investigate depressive symptomatology. 17 items are used to provide a score.","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)","description":"13 questions on mood symptoms and 2 additional questions on the co-occurrence and psychosocial impact of these symptoms.
