Phase 1 involves initial item development and measurement validation of a new tool for identifying hospitalized patients at high risk for preventable readmission. Primary tasks include item construction and content validation, data collection, analysis, and instrument refinement. Phase 2 involves administering the refined instrument to a new group of patients to determine final item content for the instrument, its factor structure, and its predictive validity.","detailedDescription":"Participants will complete the instrument on an electronic device provided by research staff in the hospital room. If an individual is unable to complete the instrument, the participant may have another individual input answers on the electronic device. Hospitalized patients (n = 1240: 620 in Phase 1 and 620 in Phase 2) with a variety of chronic diseases will be recruited into the study. Study coordinators will recruit participants with the following diagnoses: heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, pneumonia, total knee or hip replacement, and stroke. These diagnoses were chosen because of the frequency with which patients are readmitted after discharge."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure","COPD","Myocardial Infarction","Coronary Artery Bypass Graft","Pneumonia","Total Knee Replacement","Total Hip Replacement","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1218,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase I","description":"Participants will complete an intake form and assessment tool survey on an electronic device provided by research staff in their hospital room.
