Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) monitor via Near-infrared spectometry (NIRS) is recommended for early detection and correction. The standard site of NIRS sensor is forehead area which is impractical in operation with incision at forehead area. The investigators suggest an alternative sensor site at temporal area. The objective of this study is to assess the correlation of rScO2 measured from sensor attached at forehead vs. temporal area.","detailedDescription":"Cardiac surgery and neurosurgery may decrease cerebral blood flow leading to neurologic morbidity, e.g., postoperative stroke, delirium, or postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) monitor via Near-infrared spectometry (NIRS) is thus recommended for early detection and correction. Murkin et al.(2007) conducted a randomized controlled trial in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with NIRS monitoring showed that patients who received intervention to avoid rScO2 \\< 75% of baseline had less major organ morbidity including stroke, and mortality. Senanayake et al.(2012) revealed that NIRS could decrease neurologic complication in patients undergoing ascending aortic replacement with moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest.\n\nThe standard site of NIRS sensor is forehead area. There are some types of surgery involving incision at forehead area which makes it not possible to attach sensor at this site. The investigators propose an alternative sensor site at temporal area to be used in such situation.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the correlation of rScO2 measured from sensor attached at forehead vs. temporal area."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["NIRS","Regional cerebral oxygen saturation","sensor","forehead","temporal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient undergoing cardiac surgery","description":"Each patient will has 2 sets of sensors attached at forehead and temporal area.","interventionNames":["Device: Sensor at forehead area","Device: Sensor at temporal area"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sensor at forehead area","description":"NIRS sensor attached at forehead area.","armGroupLabels":["Patient undergoing cardiac surgery"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sensor at temporal area","description":"NIRS sensor attached at temporal area.","armGroupLabels":["Patient undergoing cardiac surgery"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"rScO2","description":"Regional cerebral oxygen saturation","timeFrame":"intraoperatively"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age =/\\> 18 y\n* undergoing elective cardiac surgery\n* American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification II-III\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* history of intracranial or carotid vascular disease\n* previous surgery at face or brain\n* abnormal anatomy of face\n* re-do surgery","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thepakorn Sathitkarnmanee, MD","affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon kaen, Thailand","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University","city":"Khon Kaen","zip":"40002","country":"Thailand","geoPoint":{"lat":16.44671,"lon":102.833}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21388077","type":"RESULT","citation":"Moerman A, Wouters P.
