The Primary endpoint is the instant recanalization rate of target vessel after operation. Secondary efficacy endpoints will include: 1) immediate recanalization rate of the first pass of aspiration; 2) the recanalization time of the target vessel blood flow; 3) the improvement of the postoperative NIHSS score; 4) the ratio of good neurological function (mRS 0-2 points) at 90 days; 5) the success rate of device; 6) the success rate of operation; 7) The proportion of rescue therapy. Safety endpoints will include: 1) the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours after operation; 2) all-cause death and stroke-related mortality at 90 days; 3) stroke recurrence rate within 90 days after operation; 4) surgery-related complications; 5) adverse events; 6) serious adverse events; 7) Device defection rate"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aspiration","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Large-vessel Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, multicenter, single-arm objective performance criteria","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intracranial Thrombosis Aspiration Catheter","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intracranial Thrombosis Aspiration Catheter, product of Sinomed Neurovita Technology Inc.","interventionNames":["Device: Intracranial Thrombosis Aspiration Catheter"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intracranial Thrombosis Aspiration Catheter","description":"Direct Aspiration","armGroupLabels":["Intracranial Thrombosis Aspiration Catheter"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Instant recanalization rate of target vessel after operation","description":"Instant recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) of target vessel after operation","timeFrame":"Last aspiration"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Instant recanalization rate of target vessel after the first aspiration","description":"Instant recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) of target vessel after the first aspiration","timeFrame":"First aspiration"},{"measure":"The recanalization time of the target vessel blood flow","description":"The recanalization (mTICI 2b-3) time of the target vessel blood flow","timeFrame":"Procedure time (femoral artery puncture to recanalization)"},{"measure":"The improvement of the postoperative NIHSS score the improvement of the postoperative NIHSS score","description":"NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS)：Calculates the NIH Stroke Scale for quantifying stroke severity.","timeFrame":"Change in NIHSS score at preoperative、24(-6/+24) hours、7±2 days or discharge"},{"measure":"Proportion of good neurological function (mRS 0-2)","description":"The modified Rankin Scale/Score (mRS) : scores of 0 to 2 were defined as good neurological function (treatment success)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The success rate of device","description":"The intracranial thrombus aspiration catheter was successfully delivered to the occluded segment of the blood vessel and then successfully released, and suction was performed, and the delivery system was successfully withdrawn.","timeFrame":"Intraoperative"},{"measure":"The success rate of operation","description":"The success of recanalization after the final treatment (mTICI 2b-3, allowing the use of rescue therapy)","timeFrame":"End of Procedure"},{"measure":"The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Through Heidelberg Bleeding Classification to evaluate the intracranial hemorrhage (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥4 points)","timeFrame":"24(-6/+24) hours"},{"measure":"All-cause death and stroke-related mortality","description":"All-cause death and stroke-related mortality","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"The rate of Stroke recurrence","description":"The existence of clear imaging evidence to confirm that the target vessel is occluded again, which leads to an ischemic stroke event.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Procedure-related complications","description":"Procedure-related complications: including arterial rupture, arterial dissection, distal thromboembolism, vascular puncture site complications, etc","timeFrame":"Intraoperative"},{"measure":"Adverse events and serious adverse events","description":"Any adverse events and serious adverse events are associated with clinical trials in human","timeFrame":"During the clinical trials"},{"measure":"The rate of device defection","description":"Device defection","timeFrame":"Intraoperative"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
