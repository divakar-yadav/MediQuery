Furthermore, the investigators aim to determine whether certain subgroups of patients with large baseline infarcts will have a greater treatment benefit. Finally, the investigators will assess the agreement of ASPECTS scores between site investigators, the core imaging lab, and automated software.","detailedDescription":"Prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study. Patients presenting with symptoms of AIS who have evidence of a moderate-large infarct volume (Non-contrast CT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score \\[NCCT ASPECTS\\] 2-5 in the anterior circulation will be assigned to either best medical management alone (including IV rtPA) or intra-arterial treatment (IAT) with mechanical thrombectomy added to best medical management.
