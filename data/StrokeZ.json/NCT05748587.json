And to see expressions of iron, alpha-synuclein, and lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the brain tissue of ischemic rats. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is there an association between iron and alpha-synuclein accumulation in ischemic stroke?\n* Is there any change in soluble lymphocyte activation gene levels in ischemic stroke and if these levels are related to stroke severity and infarction size? . Can soluble lymphocyte activation gene levels be used as an early biomarker to diagnose ischemic stroke?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","description":"24 healthy age and sex-matched controls","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Serum Iron","Diagnostic Test: RBCs Alpha-synuclein","Diagnostic Test: Serum Soluble lymphocyte activation gene","Radiation: Brain computed tomography"]},{"label":"Patients with acute Ischemic stroke","description":"24 patients between 50-70 years having neurological symptoms of acute ischemic stroke will be included.\n\nPatients with acute hemorrhagic stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, malignancy, and central nervous system infection will be excluded.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Serum Iron","Diagnostic Test: RBCs Alpha-synuclein","Diagnostic Test: Serum Soluble lymphocyte activation gene","Radiation: Brain computed tomography"]},{"label":"Control rats","description":"8 rats will be subjected to a Sham operation and will be injected intramuscularly immediately after the operation with an equivalent 0.9% saline solution.
