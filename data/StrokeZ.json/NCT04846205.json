OSAS generates a pressure increase in the right cavity during inspiratory efforts, which increases the number of right-left shunt embolus and therefore the risk of stroke. OSA and FOP are often thought as two separate entities, however, due to their high frequencies, they sometimes coexist and can influence the pathophysiology of each other. More researches are needed in this area to confirm this complex association and its role in triggering stroke.","detailedDescription":"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) are considered as risk factors for stroke. In most cases, the presence of FOP has no clinical impact. Certain hemodynamic conditions inducing a right-left pressure gradient can promote the reopening of a FOP and allow the passage of blood, presenting micro or macro-thrombi, from the venous system to the arterial system, explaining the mechanism of paradoxical embolism. OSAS generates a pressure increase in the right cavity during inspiratory efforts, which increases the number of right-left shunt embolus and therefore the risk of stroke. OSA and FOP are often thought as two separate entities, however, due to their high frequencies, they sometimes coexist and can influence the pathophysiology of each other. Evidence of a clinically significant interaction and causation in the genesis of stroke remains limited. More researches are needed in this area to confirm this complex association and its role in triggering stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Apnea Syndrome","Stroke"],"keywords":["obstructive sleep apnea syndrome","permeable foramen oval"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients who underwent a systematic etiological","description":"Patients who underwent a systematic etiological assessment in the context of their cryptogenic ischemic stroke between 2015 and 2020.
