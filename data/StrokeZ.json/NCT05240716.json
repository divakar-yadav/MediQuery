This impairment has a detrimental effects on the patients lies, limiting their social participation. Previous studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between triceps surae activation and gait speed in stroke patients, that is, higher triceps surae muscle activation are correspond to greater gait speed. Then, it can be hypothesized that therapies focused in strengthening the triceps surae also improves the patient gait. It has been shown that Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) can improve triceps surae activation when applied on healthy subjects. However, it has not been yet explored in chronic stroke patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess whether a FES program over tibial nerve contributes to the rehabilitation of the gait in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients. This study present a prospective interventional design, based on non-probabilistic sampling for convenience, and comprising a total of 15 volunteers with ischemic stroke of both genders and aged between 18 and 70 years old. Volunteers will be recruited from hospitals and private rehabilitation centres, and must be currently engaged in a conventional rehabilitation program. The study will consist of twenty-four sessions, with a frequency of three sessions per week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Functional electrical stimulation","Tibial Nerve stimulation","Chronic stroke","Hemiparetic gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FES program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: FES program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"FES program","description":"8 weeks intervention. 3 sessions per week. Previous to the intervention, volunteers will familiarize with the electrical stimulation by receiving three trials of the stimuli. Electrical current intensity will be set for each volunteers, with the capacity of generating a muscle contraction without inducing discomfort in the volunteer. During the FES program, patient in standing position will perform a step, while electrical current stimulation will be applied to the skin over the tibial nerve on the contralateral of the stimulation side. The FES will be delivered during the paretic plantarflexor activation according to the gait cycle. The FES session will consist of 5-minutes stimulation blocks with breaks between blocks (total session time: 30 minutes). For safety reasons, a physical therapist will supervise all the FES intervention sessions.","armGroupLabels":["FES program"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in gait velocity","description":"A 10 metres walk test will be performed to asses gait velocity.","timeFrame":"Baseline and week 8 (after 24 sessions of intervention)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in maximal isometric strength","description":"To assess maximal isometric strength of dorsiflexor muscles, volunteers will performed 3 maximum repetitions of 6 seconds of isometric dorsiflexion.

A reference electrode will be placed on the lateral malleolus. Prior to electrode placement, the skin will be shaved and cleaned with cotton and 70% alcohol, in order to minimize skin impedance.
