Traditionally, the effectiveness of rehabilitation in improving functioning for stroke patients more than 6 months has not been proven. However, spontaneous neurological recovery reaches the plateau at 3\\~6 months later.\n\nHand of Hope is a virtual reality (VR)-based, electromyography (EMG)-driven, and task-oriented hand robot. Otherwise, it needs patients to have active participation during the intervention which is critical for motor recovery after stroke. Robotic rehabilitation devices have the potential to deliver high-intensity, reproducible therapy. Robot-assisted task-oriented training had been proposed by several researchers, but the evidence of clinical effectiveness in highly functional chronic stroke patients is still lack.\n\nSpasticity is a common disorder which occurs following stroke. The prevalence of post-stroke spasticity can be as high as 46% in the chronic phase (over 3 months). Spasticity impacted activities of daily living, quality of life, pain, and functional impairments. Long-term spasticity may lead to tendon contracture and limb deformities. Botulinum toxin injection, which mostly used in chronic phase (over 6 months), had been proved to be a safe agent representing the gold standard treatment for focal spasticity, while avoiding systemic effects. But the effects of botulism toxin on functional ability are still unclear. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence on adjunctive therapies following botulism toxin.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine the effects of botulinum toxin injection combined with Hand of Hope and standard occupational therapy on upper extremity function, and compares the findings to those of amount-matched chronic stroke survivors who received only Botulinum toxin injection and standard occupational therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke","Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke","Robotic Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Hand of hope","hand robot","Botulinum toxin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botulinum toxin, hand robot training, occupational therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient would receive Botulinum toxin (Injections of 100\\~400U of Botox in the upper limb muscle with a 2ml/100U dilution), robot-assisted therapy (Hand of Hope training), and standard occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Hand of Hope","Drug: Botulinum toxin type A injection"]},{"label":"Botulinum toxin, occupational therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient would receive Botulinum toxin (Injections of 100\\~400U of Botox in the upper limb muscle with a 2ml/100U dilution) and standard occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin type A injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hand of Hope","description":"A virtual reality (VR)-based, electromyography (EMG)-driven, and task-oriented hand robot.","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum toxin, hand robot training, occupational therapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum toxin type A injection","description":"A safe agent representing the gold standard treatment for focal spasticity.","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum toxin, hand robot training, occupational therapy","Botulinum toxin, occupational therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Ashworth scale","description":"Modified Ashworth scale is a scale for spasticity evaluation, while 0 means no spasticity, 1 means slight increase in muscle tone, 1+ means more muscle tone than score equels 1, 2 means more marked muscle tone, 3 means passive movement is difficult, and 4 means rigidity.
