Up to our knowledge and search history, this is the first-ever study conducted by us which list out the challenges faced by neuro physiotherapist while teleconsultation mode among Indian population.","detailedDescription":"During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic many Neurophysiotherapist opted for telerehabilitation to provide rehabilitation to the patients. This study aims to find out challenges faced by Neurophysiotherapist (NeuroPT) for consultation through telerehabilitation within Maharashtra provenance. A total of 103 NeuroPT within Maharashtra provenance were contacted through this online survey. A brief, structured and validated questionnaire was constructed as there is no gold standard questionnaire developed to obtain responses from the neuro physiotherapists opting for telerehabilitation mode for their consultations with their clients. The questionnaire was sent by What's app and email to gather basic information to describe the various challenges in consultation through telerehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Parkinson' s Disease, Neurological Impairments, Tele-rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":103,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Opinions about tele-rehabilitation for consulting a clients with neurological impairments","description":"Opinions about telerehabilitation for consultation purpose"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Consultation Questionnaire","description":"A structured Questionnaire for Assessing a Challenges while consulting their clients through Tele-rehabilitation mode","timeFrame":"1 Week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:- A cross-sectional study was carried out to obtain the responses from the neuro physiotherapist practicing within Maharashtra provenance.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neurophysiotherapist practicing outside of Maharashtra provenance","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Neurophysiotherapist practicing within Maharashtra provenance","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nawaj M Pathan, MPT","affiliation":"MGM School Of Physiotherapy, Aurangabad","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"MGM School Of Physiotherapy","city":"Aurangabad","state":"Maharashtra","zip":"431003","country":"India","geoPoint":{"lat":19.87757,"lon":75.34226}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"The data will be shared on ethical and valid requests by genuine researchers.","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL","ICF"],"timeFrame":"For Next 1 Year","accessCriteria":"Request through the registered Email on Mahatma Gandhi Health Sciences official email id or to principal investigator","url":"http://mgmsop.edu.in"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010300","term":"Parkinson Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020734","term":"Parkinsonian Disorders"},{"id":"D000001480","term":"Basal Ganglia Diseases"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009069","term":"Movement Disorders"},{"id":"D000080874","term":"Synucleinopathies"},{"id":"D000019636","term":"Neurodegenerative Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12903","name":"Parkinson Disease","asFound":"Parkinson s Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M22184","name":"Parkinsonian Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25293","name":"Ganglion Cysts","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16048","name":"Synovial Cyst","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4464","name":"Basal Ganglia Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11719","name":"Movement Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2217","name":"Synucleinopathies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21248","name":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4202","name":"Oculocerebral Syndrome With Hypopigmentation","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
