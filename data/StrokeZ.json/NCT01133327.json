Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Predominant mechanism responsible for stroke is embolism from proximal rupture of atherosclerotic plaque and thrombus. 25-30% of stroke deaths related to the carotid stenosis. The primary therapy for carotid occlusive disease is the surgical removal of this atherosclerotic plaque from inside the artery. Another treatment option for subjects with significant surgical risk factors has been found: the carotid artery stenting is a non-surgical procedure which unblocks narrowing of the carotid artery lumen by inserting a small metal tube (stent) to keep the plaque against the wall of the artery to improve blood flow."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Disease","Carotid Stenosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Carotid Artery Stenting","High Risk patient","Carotid artery stenosis","stroke","Carotid artery disease","ASTI study","Adapt Carotid Stent system","FilterWire EZ Embolic Protection System"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adapt Carotid Stent System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention with Adapt Carotid Stent System with the FilterWire EZ System","interventionNames":["Device: Carotid Artery Stenting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Carotid Artery Stenting","description":"The Adapt Carotid Stent System is intended to deliver a self-expanding Stent to the extra-cranial carotid arteries via a sheathed percutaneous Monorail delivery system.
