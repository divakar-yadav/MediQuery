Determine individual and interindividual variations in recovery in the different domains.\n\nInformed consent Written informed consent will be obtained from all willing participants or their next-of-kin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke, Ischemic","Risk Factor, Cardiovascular","Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["recovery","rehabilitation","stroke severity","plasticity","modified Rankin Scale","National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale","Fugl-Meyer assessment","blood sampling","stroke subtype"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Protocol At admission participants undergo adequate neuroimaging and additional work-up according to clinical routine and answer questionaries on medical history, education, occupancy, pre-stroke functionality and donate blood samples.
