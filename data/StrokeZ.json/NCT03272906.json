Subjects will participate in the procedures twice, once under each condition (active vs. sham stimulation). The order of conditions will be counter-balanced across subjects. Stimulation will target ventral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and will be paired with standard speech-language therapy. Outcome measures will be acquired at the beginning and end of a semester of standard speech-language therapy, and at follow-up.","detailedDescription":"Baseline Behavioral Assessment: Medical and neurological history will be taken. Western Aphasia Battery-Revised, Communication Activities of Daily Living-2, and Philadelphia Naming Test (short form) will be administered. Narrative will be elicited (Cinderella story). Some of these procedures will be videorecorded for later transcription. Subjects will also complete a pre-tDCS safety screening questionnaire.\n\ntDCS: Participants will undergo placement of 2 tDCS electrodes. For all subjects, the anodal electrode will be placed at the following locations (EEG 10-20 system):\n\n(i) over the left inferior frontal gyrus (crossing point between T3-Fz and F7-Cz)\n\nThe cathodal electrode will be placed at the second site:\n\n(ii) over right frontal pole (Fp2)\n\nTwo types of stimulation will be given, an active condition and a sham condition. In the sham condition, stimulation is ramped up over the first 30 seconds (as in the active condition), but then discontinued. This gives the physical perception of stimulation without the modulatory effects.\n\nStimulation will be delivered by a tDCS device with the following parameters for intensity and duration:\n\n* Intensity: 2 mA\n* Duration: 20 minutes\n\ntDCS will be provided for the first 20 minutes of each aphasia therapy session provided at the LSU Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic. The therapy sessions last for one hour and are provided twice weekly for 12 weeks over the course of an academic semester (fall and spring).\n\nPost-Therapy/Stimulation Assessment: Western Aphasia Battery-Revised, Communication Activities of Daily Living-2, and Philadelphia Naming Test (short form) will be administered as before therapy. Cinderella narrative will again be elicited. Some of these procedures will again be videorecorded for later transcription. A tDCS sensations survey will also be completed at the final assessment to determine the effectiveness of blinding."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["aphasia","stroke","tDCS","language","stimulation","brain","speech therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A-tDCS & speech-language therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (2 mA) plus speech-language therapy for 24 sessions (20-minutes per each 60-minute treatment session) over the course of 12 weeks.
