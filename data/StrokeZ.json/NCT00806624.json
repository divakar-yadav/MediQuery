Subjects will be treated on an outpatient basis. The subjects will be allocated randomly to the open-label warfarin or any double-blind DU-176b dosages. DU-176b will be administered orally for 12 weeks at two fixed doses. Warfarin will be used as active control. Warfarin dosing will be managed and monitored by the Investigator with the dose adjusted to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, inclusive. The primary endpoints are incidence of major, clinically relevant non-major and minor bleeding events (all bleeding)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":234,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"DU-176b tablets: high-dose","interventionNames":["Drug: DU-176b tablets"]},{"label":"3","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Warfarin tablets","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin tablets"]},{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"DU-176b tablets: low-dose","interventionNames":["Drug: DU-176b tablets"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"DU-176b tablets","description":"DU-176b tablets taken once daily for up to 3 months","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"DU-176b tablets","description":"DU-176b tablets taken once daily for up to 3 months","armGroupLabels":["2"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin tablets","description":"Warfarin tablets taken once daily for up to 3 months","armGroupLabels":["3"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of All Bleeding","description":"Incidence of all bleeding (major, clinically relevant non-major and minor) in two fixed dosage of DU-176b in comparison with warfarin as active control in subjects with non-valvular AF.","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of Incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events: Stroke, Systemic Embolic Event, Myocardial Infarction, Cardiovascular Death, and Hospitalization for Any Cardiac Condition","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of Effects on Biomarkers of Thrombus Formation","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of Plasma Concentration of DU-176","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of Effects on Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of All Clinical and Laboratory Safety Data.","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or female subjects 18 to 80 years of age\n* Non-valvular AF supported by abnormal ECG documented for two times (interval of more than 1 week) within 6 months prior to randomization.\n* CHADS2 Score of at least 1.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects with mitral valve disease\n* Subjects with previous valvular heart surgery\n* Contraindication for anticoagulants\n* Conditions associated with high risk of bleeding\n* Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MI, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or coronary artery/cardiac/other major surgery within the previous 30 days\n* Active infective endocarditis or life-expectancy \\< 12 months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"city":"Hong-Kong","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":22.39407,"lon":114.13737}},{"city":"Seoul","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}},{"city":"Singapore","country":"Singapore","geoPoint":{"lat":1.28967,"lon":103.85007}},{"city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"De-identified individual participant data (IPD) and applicable supporting clinical trial documents may be available upon request at https://vivli.org/.
