The MRMI is highly reliable between raters (ICC= 0.98) and has high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93) to early stage patients with stroke. The MRMI consists of eight test items, including turning over, changing from lying to sitting, maintaining sitting balance, going from sitting to standing, standing, transferring, walking indoors, and climbing stairs. The score of MRMI range from 0 to 40. One main characteristic of the MRMI is that participants are scored by observation of their performance on the items directly. Change in MRMI i.e. MRMI gain is the difference between pre-discharge MRMI and admission MRMI.","timeFrame":"baseline and 1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Modified Barthel Index (MBI) Gain","description":"MBI was used to assess subjects' basic activities of daily living (ADL) in this study. MBI measures the subject's performance on ten functional items including self-care, continence, and locomotion. The values assigned to each item are based on the amount of physical assistance required to perform the task and added to give a total score ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = fully dependent, 100 = fully independent) with higher score indicating higher levels of physical function. There are no subtotal score because there are no sub-scales. The internal consistency reliability coefficient for MBI is 0.90. Change in MBI i.e. MBI gain is the difference between pre- discharge MBI and admission MBI.","timeFrame":"baseline and 1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with principal diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident, stroke, or hemiplegia and has received and completed stroke rehabilitation program in a hospital in Hong Kong between the periods of 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2015.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with principal diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident, stroke, or hemiplegia and has received but cannot completed stroke rehabilitation program in a hospital in Hong Kong between the periods of 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2015.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with principal diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident, stroke, or hemiplegia.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
