The main recognized risk factors for delayed cardiotoxicity are cumulative anthracycline dose, female gender, association with mediastinal radiotherapy and young age at administration. Prediction of delayed cardiotoxicity in children population is still challenging.\n\nThe \"Speckle Tracking Echocardiography\" (STE) method, an innovative echocardiographic technique, analyses the myocardial displacement of natural acoustic markers via a software. The objective of the study is to analyze, in young patients who received anthracycline therapy in childhood, 5-years after their inclusion in the \"Speckle Anthra\" study and first STE results, the evolution of myocardial function using STE method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiotoxicity","Childhood Cancer"],"keywords":["Echocardiography","Ventricular function","Stroke Volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anthra2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient will have an echocardiography with speckle tracking analysis 5 years after the end of their participation to \"SpeckleAnthra\" study (NCT02893787)","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: cardiac ultrasound with speckle tracking analysis"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cardiac ultrasound analysis with speckle tracking of age- and sex-matched healthy patients in the Anthra2 group","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: cardiac ultrasound with speckle tracking analysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"cardiac ultrasound with speckle tracking analysis","description":"Experimental group: cardiac ultrasound with speckle tracking analysis done during a regular cardiac visit planned after receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy in childhood.\n\nControl group: cardiac ultrasound with speckle tracking analysis done during a cardiac visit for minor symptoms (murmur, physical aptitude).\n\nAdvocated Tomtec software will be used to make post-processing speckle tracking analysis based on 2D ultrasound cineloop acquired during a standard echocardiography.","armGroupLabels":["Anthra2","Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Left Ventricle Global Longitudinal 2D strain (LVGLS) expressed in percentage and obtained from cardiac ultrasound cineloop of 2D 4,3 and 2 apical views analyzed by the Tomtec STE Software.","description":"To compare the evolution at 5 years (\"Anthra2\" study timeframe) of LVGLS obtained by STE analysis on patients treated with anthracyclines in childhood and previously included in first \"Speckle Anthra\" study, with the normal evolution of this parameter with age in healthy matched volunteers.","timeFrame":"5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Left Ventricle Ejection fraction (LVEF) by Simpson method (%)","description":"Compare the standard ultrasound parameter LVEF and the LVGLS obtained in \"Speckle Anthra 2\" on patients treated with anthracyclines in childhood and in the group of healthy volunteers.","timeFrame":"The day of inclusion"},{"measure":"Left ventricular myocardial dysfunction defined by LVEF < 55%","description":"Correlation between the left ventricular myocardial dysfunction is defined by FeVG \\< 55% and the left global longitudinal 2D strain expressed in percentage and measured during the previous SpeckleAnthra study","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Death secondary to toxic cardiomyopathy","description":"Correlation between the rate of patients died with a toxic cardiomyopathy and the left global longitudinal 2D strain expressed in percentage and measured during the previous SpeckleAnthra study","timeFrame":"5 years"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Known risk factors for cardiotoxicity","description":"To assess the effect of known risk factors for anthracycline cardiotoxicity, the anthracycline cumulative dose will be collected","timeFrame":"the day of inclusion"},{"measure":"Troponin T on the experimental group","description":"Troponin T is a biological markers of cardiotoxicity obtained in a standard blood test analysis and expressed in ng/ml. normal troponin value is between 0 and 0.04 ng/mL","timeFrame":"The day of inclusion"},{"measure":"NT-pro-BNP on the experimental group","description":"NT-pro-BNP (N terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptides) is a biological markers of cardiotoxicity obtained in a standard blood test analysis and expressed in pg/ml.
