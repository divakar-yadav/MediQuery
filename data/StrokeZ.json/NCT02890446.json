Participants were randomly assigned to either the internal or external focus treatment groups and received 12 sessions of arm training.","detailedDescription":"Participants were randomized to one of two treatment groups and received upper arm reaching training on the InMotion 2 shoulder robot (12 hourly sessions over four weeks). The external focus group received instructions specifically to pay attention to the task goal--hitting targets on the video game, while the internal focus group was instructed to pay attention to the movement of their arm motions (video game monitor was turned off). Both groups practiced the same arm reaching pattern and were matched for level of arm impairment and training dosage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["attentional focus","upper extremity","hemiparesis","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"External Focus (EF)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants received arm training using the InMotion2 robot under external focus practice conditions and instructions.
