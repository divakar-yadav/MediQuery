The traditional therapy includes drugs and physical rehabilitation, without systematization, with complicates its replication. The transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation might promote an increase in the motor function of the hands, when compared with placebo stimulation.\n\nIn fact, some clinical trials point positive effects of transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) as a post-stroke intervention, however, in general, they only include patients in the chronic stage, with cerebral damage in different areas and diverse disabilities, most being assisted by non-standardized physical therapy treatments. tDCS combined with a standardized physiotherapy program, noted as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), could be able to modulate the cortical excitability and promote better functional recovery.\n\nHowever, no relate of longitudinal studies assessing patients in the acute stage submitted to tDCS and physiotherapy for more than 6 months have been found. Studies like this would help us elucidate the action mechanisms of this treatment in the early stages of stroke.\n\nWith this in mind, START - tDCS, a phase II/III clinical trial, will be developed to assess the therapeutic effects of the tDCS in early stage enrolling 40 post-stroke patients. They will be allocated in 2 groups at random to receive active tDCS or sham, associate to CIMT. The protocol will be applied in a daily basis for 10 consecutive working days (2 weeks), after that, the patients will be followed for 1 month. By the end of the study, the participants that receive tDCS and show better clinical condition will be invited to participate in bimonthly stimulation for 12 months, as part of a longitudinal study regarding tDCS for stroke. An increase in the clinical condition will be considered as a final score higher than 10 points in the Barthel Index, our primary outcome, when compared with baseline, before the treatment protocol."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Direct Current Stimulation","Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active tdcs / CIMT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the acute post-stroke stage will receive active tDCS associate to rehabilitation (CIMT)","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation / CIMT","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in the acute post-stroke stage will receive sham stimulation associate to rehabilitation (CIMT)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy","Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial direct current stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Active tdcs / CIMT"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Active tdcs / CIMT","Sham stimulation / CIMT"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Sham stimulation / CIMT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Independence measured by Barthel Index","timeFrame":"Change for functional independence at 4 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cognitive dysfunction (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 1) and Endpoint (week 4)"},{"measure":"Executive functions (Victoria version of the Stroop Color and Word Test)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 1) and Endpoint (week 4)"},{"measure":"Attention and Working Memory (Digit span subtest)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 1) and Endpoint (week 4)"},{"measure":"Spasticity","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Muscle strength","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Balance","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Posture","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Fear of falling during daily life activities","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Upper limb function","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Quality of life","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"},{"measure":"Lower limb function","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischaemic acute stroke\n* Informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 25 ≤ National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ≤ 32\n* Rankim ≥ 5\n* Mini Mental State Examination ≤ 24\n* tDCS criteria: use of modulators of the Central Nervous System drugs; patients with implanted metallic or electronic devices; pacemaker; seizures; pregnancy;any other condition that might limit or interfere in the sensorimotor system CIMT criteria: inability to actively execute the movements of wrist flexion, metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal active extension of 10º and wrist extension of 20º","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Suellen Andrade","role":"CONTACT","email":"suellenandrade@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Federal University of Paraíba,Department of Psychology","city":"João Pessoa","state":"Paraíba","zip":"58051-900","country":"Brazil","contacts":[{"name":"Suellen Andrade","role":"CONTACT","email":"suellenandrade@gmail.com"},{"name":"Suellen Andrade","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-7.115,"lon":-34.86306}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33175411","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Elsner B, Kugler J, Pohl M, Mehrholz J.
