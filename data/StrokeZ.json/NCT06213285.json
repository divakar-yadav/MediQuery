The derived studies should support therapeutic decision-making, improve risk-stratification in LAAC and help generate hypotheses for potential future clinical intervention trials.","detailedDescription":"An investigator-driven multicenter retrospective observational database enrolling patients from high-volume North American and European centers. The database will include Watchman FLX implanted patients with a minimum of one follow-up cardiac CT performed within 45-120 days post-procedure. Additional timepoints may be entered. Cardiac CT scans are to be uploaded and will be analyzed by the core-lab at Aarhus University Hospital.\n\nInvestigator-reported findings will be systematically reported to the database. This includes information on baseline characteristics, preprocedural planning, implantation details, discharge medication, follow-up imaging and clinical endpoints of interest.\n\nAs a minimum, investigator-reported endpoints will be collected from patient registries at one-year follow-up by site-investigators. Endpoints of interest include ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, mortality, device-related thrombosis, pericardial effusion, vascular complications, and device migration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Device Related Thrombosis","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion","Cardiac Computed Tomography","Watchman FLX"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Watchman FLX left atrial appendage occlusion","description":"Early (30-120 days) CT follow-up after Watchman FLX LAAO","otherNames":["left atrial appendage closure","LAAO","LAAC"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ischemic stroke","description":"Clinically affirmed ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"Minimum 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Device-related thrombosis","description":"High-grade hypoattenuated thickening as seen on cardiac CT","timeFrame":"Minimum 12 months"},{"measure":"Major bleeding","description":"BARC \\>=2","timeFrame":"Minimum 12 months"},{"measure":"All-cause and cardiovascular mortality","description":"As defined in the Munich consensus","timeFrame":"Minimum 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Watchman FLX LAAO\n* A minimum of one follow-up cardiac CT performed within 30-120 days post-procedure.\n* A minimum of one year clinical follow-up data","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Watchman FLX implanted patients with a minimum of one early follow-up cardiac CT.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Anders Kramer, MD","affiliation":"Aarhus University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Mayo Clinic","city":"Rochester","state":"Minnesota","zip":"55901","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":44.02163,"lon":-92.4699}},{"facility":"Aarhus University Hospital","city":"Aarhus","zip":"8200","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":56.15674,"lon":10.21076}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"Patient data will be registered under a pseudonymous registry-ID and will not be personally identifiable."}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"},{"id":"D000013927","term":"Thrombosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000016769","term":"Embolism and Thrombosis"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16376","name":"Thrombosis","asFound":"Thrombosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7474","name":"Embolism","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18818","name":"Embolism and Thrombosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
