Stimulation site (perilesional or contralesional) and frequency (excitatory high or inhibitory low) will be determined by activation pattern from the fNIRS with language task in individual patients.\n\nThe patient who shows a dominant neural activity at perilesional Broca's area on fNIRS scanning will be randomly allocated into two groups: high frequency stimulation group and sham stimulation group. If a patient shows a dominant neural activity at contralesional homologs of Broca's area on fNIRS scanning, the patient will be allocated to a low frequency stimulation group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"],"keywords":["Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy","Stroke","Aphasia","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MagPro magnetic stimulator (HF rTMS)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Most activated area from fNIRS with language task: Perilesional Broca's area","interventionNames":["Device: MagPro magnetic stimulator (HF rTMS)"]},{"label":"MagPro magnetic stimulator (sham)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Most activated area from fNIRS with language task: Perilesional Broca's area","interventionNames":["Device: MagPro magnetic stimulator (sham)"]},{"label":"MagPro magnetic stimulator (LF rTMS)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Most activated area from fNIRS with language task: Contralesional homologs of Broca's area","interventionNames":["Device: MagPro magnetic stimulator (LF rTMS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MagPro magnetic stimulator (HF rTMS)","description":"Most activated area from fNIRS findings: Perilesional Broca's area.
