The focus is on diseases that are associated with dementia: Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and vascular cognitive impairment (resulting from stroke).\n\nONDRI is a province-wide collaboration between more than 50 of Ontario's world-class neurodegenerative disease researchers and clinicians, four patient advocacy groups, the industrial sector, and more than 20 clinical, academic and research centres carried out in partnership with the Ontario Brain Institute (OBI).\n\nInstead of only studying what's unique, our long-term observational study is seeking out the common early indicators and risk factors of the five diseases.\n\nOur mandate is to ensure that the findings from the data collected are transformed into new diagnostic methods that will help detect diseases earlier, improved clinical practice that puts patients first, and eventually new effective treatments that will slow the diseases from progressing or even prevent the disease so people can continue to enjoy the later years of their lives.\n\nMore than 600 participants will be followed for up to three years and will complete assessments for genomics, gait and balance, eye measurements, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging and will donate their data to a comprehensive integrated data management system called Brain-CODE."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alzheimer Disease","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Frontotemporal Dementia","Parkinson Disease","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood for genomic analysis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) for rare variant genes potentially predictive of dementias."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":522,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Observational Cohort"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Eye Tracking - Pro Saccade and Anti Saccade","description":"Pro-saccade task assesses simple sensory-motor function by following eye movement for specific tasks.\n\n• Anti-saccade task is identical to the pro-saccade task, except the instruction, indicated by fixation point (FP) colour,and is a sensitive indicator of cognitive disturbances.","timeFrame":"5 Years"},{"measure":"Retinal Nerve Imaging","description":"Institutions with the Heidelberg Spectralis with Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) Blue Peak Instrumentation will participate in this assessment.\n\nBoth eyes of all participants will undergo:\n\n* Assessment of best corrected visual acuity\n* Digital colour fundus photography.\n* Retinal nerve imaging","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Gait and Balance","description":"All participants will perform walks along a 6 metre path while wearing hip and ankle accelerometers.
