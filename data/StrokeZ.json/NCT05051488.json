The plates allow for rigid and semi-rigid bone flap fixation dependent on the implantation technique. A dynamic craniotomy involves bone flap fixation wherein a limited transient outward bone flap movement is allowed by the plates to compensate for an increase in intracranial pressure from brain swelling. The plates also prevent the craniotomy bone flap from sinking inside the skull and compressing on the brain. Cerebral decompression surgery is undertaken for patients with cerebral swelling from malignant strokes, medically intractable intracranial pressure elevation in traumatic brain injuries and brain tumors. The dynamic craniotomy technique eliminates or reduces the need for a cranioplasty surgery with a potentially significant improvement in outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Edema","TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury)","Stroke, Acute","Cerebral Hemorrhage","Brain Tumor"],"keywords":["decompressive craniotomy","dynamic craniotomy","craniectomy","cranial fixation plate","cerebral swelling","intracranial hypertension","cranioplasty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Dynamic craniotomy","description":"Dynamic decompressive craniotomy with semi-rigid bone flap fixation"},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Dynamic craniotomy","description":"Dynamic decompressive craniotomy with semi-rigid bone flap fixation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical outcome","description":"Modified Rankin Scale and Glasgow Outcome Score","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Craniotomy bone flap healing","description":"CT scan to assess rate of normal bone flap position","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients undergoing craniotomy who are at an increased risk for developing post- operative brain swelling or increased intracranial pressure from a malignant stroke\n* Patients undergoing craniotomy who are at an increased risk for developing post- operative brain swelling or increased intracranial pressure from traumatic brain injury\n* Patients undergoing craniotomy who are at an increased risk for developing post- operative brain swelling or increased intracranial pressure from brain tumors.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with blown pupil (cerebral herniation),\n* Massive brain swelling\n* Dismal outcome not expected to survive more than 1-2 weeks.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult patients undergoing craniotomy who are at an increased risk for developing post- operative brain swelling or increased intracranial pressure from malignant strokes, traumatic brain injury, and/or brain tumors.
