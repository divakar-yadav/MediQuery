S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is still being tested in research studies. Currently commercially available PEGJ tubes are long tubes which are placed into the part of the small intestine that connects to the stomach (duodenum) under endoscopic guidance. The tip of these PEGJ tubes usually have some built-in extra weight (several grams), which theoretically should prevent slippage of the tube back into the stomach. However, these tubes usually cannot be placed very far into the duodenum and the build-in weight is usually not sufficient to keep the tube in place.\n\nThe tip of the currently commercially available PEGJ tubes often (usually within 1-2 weeks) migrates back into the stomach and at that point the tube needs to be replaced. The investigational PEGJ feeding tube used in this study is self-propelled and has a balloon on its tip. The tip of this tube is directed endoscopically through the part of the stomach that connects to the duodenum (pylorus), then the balloon is filled with 5 cc of water and the endoscope is removed. The water filled balloon then is carried by the movement of the intestinal muscles through the duodenum into the middle section of the small intestine (jejunum). It is hoped that such a deep position of the tip of the self-propelled PEGJ tube and presence of the water-filled balloon on its tip will prevent migration of the tube back into the stomach and therefore eliminates the need for tube replacement.\n\nThe only difference between the currently approved PEGJ feeding tube and the investigational one being used in this study is the addition of the balloon to the tip of the J port. People who come to Johns Hopkins Hospital for PEGJ placement as part of standard clinical care and who are not pregnant may join the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["GERD"],"keywords":["PEGJ","PEG-J","percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy","feeding tube","gastroparesis","acute pancreatitis","stroke","respiratory failure","GERD","balloon","self-propelled"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PEGJ","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this arm will receive self-propelled balloon PEGJ tube.","interventionNames":["Device: PEGJ tube"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"PEGJ tube","description":"The self-propelled PEGJ feeding tube","armGroupLabels":["PEGJ"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety: Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"One week after the procedure patients were called by one of the study investigators and were asked whether or not they had Abdominal pain, Nausea or Vomiting after the procedure.","timeFrame":"From date of PEGJ placement up to 3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Retrograde Migration of PEGJ Feeding Tube Within 3 Weeks of Placement","description":"An Abdominal X-ray was obtained 3 weeks after the procedure to check whether or not there was any PEGJ feeding tube migration.","timeFrame":"From date of PEGJ placement up to 3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age 18-90 years\n* need for post-pyloric feeding (patients unable to eat due to stroke, intubated patients with respiratory failure, patients with acute pancreatitis, etc)\n* ability to give informed consent for the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with uncorrectable bleeding disorders (INR more than 1.5, platelet count less than 50,000)\n* inability to get informed consent for the study from patients or their families\n* pregnancy (all women of child-bearing age will undergo urine pregnancy testing)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mouen Khashab, MD","affiliation":"Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Gastroenterology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Johns Hopkins Hospital","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21205","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23622977","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Kim KJ, Victor D, Stein E, Valeshabad AK, Saxena P, Singh VK, Lennon AM, Clarke JO, Khashab MA.
