There are ocassions where it is not possible to have a long corridor to measure gait speed. It is necessary to have a tool to evaluate gait speed in a small space as 4-meter walk test.","detailedDescription":"Walking speed is an important aspect of gait and is commonly used as an objective measure of functional mobility in both clinical and research settings. The majority who have suffered a stroke tend to have gait disturbances. Regaining locomotor ability is one of the primary goals in stroke rehabilitation, and it is most commonly measured using changes in self-selected walking speed. Although many of them can walk independently, they do not do so with enough speed and endurance to allow them to perform their activities of daily living prior to stroke. Not only is self-selected walking speed simple, cost effective, reliable, valid, sensitive, and specific, but it is also highly related to the severity of impairment and predicts functional walking status. It is recommended as a \"vital sign\" of health. Improvements in walking speed of 0.1 m/s or more have been shown to be a predictor of good health. However, decreased walking speed has been related to worse health outcomes and frailty in older people.\n\nThe 4-meter walk test (4 MWT) and 10-meter walk test (10 MWT) is currently applied using various timing protocols and distance covered that may affect data interpretation with a standard value, and comparisons among the studies. There are two protocols to measure walking speed, static and flying start. A static start (i.e., record the time used to cover a total walkway or from the start to stop walking) or a flying start (i.e., measured the time while walking in the middle of the walkway).\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the test-retest reliability of the 4 MWT and 10 MWT and their correlation with 5-repetition sit-to-stand in chronic stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["walking speed","gait","sit-to-stand","reliability","validity","correlation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke survivors","description":"Chronic stroke, generally speaking chronic stroke refers to the period of recovery that takes place at least six months after the initial stroke event","interventionNames":["Other: Assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Assessment","description":"The participants walk 4-meter and 10-meter and 5-repetition sit-to-stand twice.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke survivors"],"otherNames":["Evaluation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reliability of 4-meter walking test","description":"Reliability is the overall consistency of a measure.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Reliability of 4-meter walking test","description":"Reliability is the overall consistency of a measure.","timeFrame":"1 hour later from baseline"},{"measure":"Validity of 4-meter walking test","description":"Validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Validity of 4-meter walking test","description":"Validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world","timeFrame":"1 hour later from baseline"},{"measure":"Reliability of 10-meter walking test","description":"Reliability is the overall consistency of a measure.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Reliability of 10-meter walking test","description":"Reliability is the overall consistency of a measure.","timeFrame":"1 hour later from baseline"},{"measure":"Validity of 10-meter walking test","description":"Validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Validity of 10-meter walking test","description":"Validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world","timeFrame":"1 hour later from baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation of 5-repetition sit-to-stand with 4-meter walking test","description":"A rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two rankings, and can be used to assess the significance of the relation between them.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Correlation of 5-repetition sit-to-stand with 10-meter walking test","description":"A rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two rankings, and can be used to assess the significance of the relation between them.","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All study participants are clinically diagnosed with stroke\n* Adult participants, defined as \\>18 years of age\n* Have preserved cognitive ability: Achieve a score equal to or greater than 25 points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test.\n* Have the ability to walk on a flat surface of at least 20 meters, with or without aid.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A history of lower extremities injury or surgery\n* A history of botulinum injection within 3 months\n* A history of inflammatory arthritis\n* A history of inflammatory myopathy or peripheral nervous disease\n* A history of other neurological disease as a Parkinson, spinal cord etc.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke survivors in chronic phase \\> 6 months","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Laura García-Rueda, MsC","affiliation":"Universitat Internacional de Catalunya","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universitat Internacional de Catalunya","city":"Barcelona","zip":"08195","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19856632","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Bohannon RW.
