Patients will be observed after their Emergency Department (ED) disposition to determine clinical outcomes (length of stay in the hospital, the development of any organ dysfunction, mortality and need for unscheduled medical care within the ensuing 30 days). It is anticipated that specific ED hemodynamic profiles will be predictive of better clinical outcomes than others. This information will provide the outcome data needed to design future therapeutic trials that will evaluate the effect of ED hemodynamic manipulations on overall patient management and outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The PREMIUM Registry is a multinational, prospective, observational convenience study of the ED hemodynamic profiles of patients presenting with acute CHF, stroke and systemic infections and their potential relationship with patient outcomes. Continuous hemodynamics will be measured by noninvasive means using the Nexfin device and outcomes (in hospital length of stay, the interval development of organ dysfunction and mortality or the need for unscheduled medical care within the ensuing 30 days) will be captured within the registry.\n\nThe treating ED physicians will be blinded to the hemodynamic monitoring and there will be no modification of the standard care that each patient receives. Hospital charts will be reviewed and patients/family members will be additionally called at 30 days after the hospital visit in order to collect any additional outcome data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute CHF","Acute Stroke Syndromes","Systemic Infections"],"keywords":["ED hemodynamic profiles","patients treated under current clinical standards","Acute CHF","Stroke syndromes","Systemic infection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":514,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute CHF","description":"1.
