This condition has been described predominantly in the black population. However, limited data are available for the epidemiology of carotid web and often result from selected population studies. It has been shown that the carotid web is a focal intimal dysplasia. Rate of ischemic stroke recurrence is high, even in patients treated with antiplatelet therapy. This subtle lesion is often unknown and misdiagnosed including in stroke unit. We assume that the implementation of a multicentric cohort would allow a comprehensive analysis of the carotid web condition.","detailedDescription":"Carotid web lesions associated with cerebral infarctions are a relatively rare and largely unknown disease. However, carotid web lesions are associated with severe infarction involving the functional and vital prognosis of patients. The high rate of recurrence should lead to an identification of the lesion at the first event in order to propose a suitable preventive treatment. We believe that only a multicenter cohort will be able to analyze the characteristics of the pathology and propose studies on critical size samples. A national cohort would lead quickly to a consequent collection of cases. By including overseas departments and communities, notions of prevalence and characteristics within different populations could finally be studied. Participation to the cohort constitution will probably lead to sensitizing the various actors of the course of stroke care to the diagnosis and appropriate care of the carotid web.\n\nPatients will be selected by the Stroke Units which take part in the cohort constitution. Stroke Unit investigator will fill the WEPI online entry database. Clinical, imaging and outcome characteristics will be informed.\n\nIn order to guarantee the quality of the cases collected, the validation of the carotid web lesion will be carried out by a pair of expert Neurologist - Neuroradiologist appointed within an expert committee. In case of no consensus, a third expert will resolve the disagreement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Arteries"],"keywords":["Carotid Web","Cerebral Infarction","Cohort"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CAROtid WEB associated with cerebral infarction","description":"french multicentric cohort that collects retrospectively and prospectively purely observational data on patients with cerebral infarction associated with a carotid web.
