The design allows a broad range of common objects of daily life to be seamlessly transformed into 'therapeutic' input devices by instrumenting with a small motion sense mouse. Based on individual abilities and treatment needs, objects are selected to train specific fine/ gross dexterous functions. The object manipulations (therapeutic exercises) are then used to control and play any commercially available computer game, making practice challenging and engaging.\n\nThe study is of twelve weeks duration comparing the computer gaming and conventional hand exercises in ten people with hemiplegia after Stroke affecting the hand. The investigators hypothesize that the game based exercises will improve hand function and will be feasible. A mixed-effect repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to test pre to post treatment outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Hand exercises","Hand function","Computer based exercises","Therapeutic gaming"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Computer gaming hand exercise regimen.","interventionNames":["Other: Computer gaming hand exercise regimen."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Computer gaming hand exercise regimen.","description":"Computer gaming hand exercise regimen using common objects of daily life.
