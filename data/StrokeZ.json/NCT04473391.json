The present study aimed to measure the changes in the biomechanics of the gait of people with Stroke after training with functional electrical stimulation for the lower extremities.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality, morbidity and disability in adults in developed countries. Survivors may suffer several neurological deficits or deficiencies, such as hemiparesis, communication disorders, cognitive deficits and visuospatial perception disorders. Hemiplegia is a par loss of hemi-body voluntary motricity following a brain injury, usually resulting in alterations of the locomotor system with persistent disorders of movement and posture. Hemiplegia significantly affects gait performance. Gait recovery is an important objective in the rehabilitation program for stroke patients.The currently available treatment techniques include classical techniques of gait rehabilitation, functional electrical stimulation, electromechanic devices, robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces, among others.The evidence suggest that the combination of different rehabilitation strategies is more effective than conventional rehabilitation techniques alone. Technology-based rehabilitation methods such as robotic devices need more research to demonstrate their effects on gait recovery.\n\nThe present study aimed to identify the changes in the gait characteristics of subjects with stroke after a treatment program with FES for the lower extremities through instrumental gait analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Gait","Functional Electrical Stimulation","Rehabilitation","Gait Deviation Index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-assisted Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) training with a lower extremity cycle-ergometer (MOTOmed Viva 2, Reck GmbH., Germany) and a 6-channel FES Device (TrainFES, Biomedical Devices SpA, Chile).
