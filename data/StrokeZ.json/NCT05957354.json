Using the personalized brain functional sectors (pBFS) technique, investigators could precisely identify individualized brain functional networks and the personalized language-related stimulation site based on the resting-state functional MRI data. The current study proposes to conduct a double-blinded, randomized and parallel controlled design trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of pBFS-guided dual-target rTMS intervention in post-stroke aphasic patients.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to the following two groups: active continuous TBS (cTBS) group, or a sham control group. The allocation ratio will be 1:1. The stimulation protocol consisted of a 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week (totally 15 day-treatment). The stimulation procedure will be assisted with real-time neuronavigation to ensure its precision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active cTBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: active continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]},{"label":"sham cTBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: sham continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive a combination of stimulation sequences, including a 600-pulse cTBS targeting at the right IFG, followed by a 600-pulse cTBS targeting at the right STG, which will be repeated once more (a total of 2400 pulses daily).
