In both arms the other ESWT parameters (types of ESWT, intensity, frequency, location) and stretching sessions are the same.\n\nSecondary objectives: to compare functional performances in these two groups of patients receiving the different rehabilitation protocol with ESWT, using the following parameters:\n\n- Six Minutes walking test (6MWT) ; - Time Up \\& Go (TUG); - Modified Ashworth scale (MAS); - Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS); - passive ankle range of motion (p-ROM), pain (NRS); and presence of ankle clonus. These parameters are assessed during baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1) and after 12 weeks (T2)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Triceps Sural Spasticity","Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: ESWT + Stretching"]},{"label":"Group II","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Procedure: ESWT and SHAM + Stretching"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"ESWT + Stretching","description":"3 weeks intervention:\n\n* 3 sessions of ESWT, once a week\n* 6 sessions of passive stretching, twice a week","armGroupLabels":["Group I"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"ESWT and SHAM + Stretching","description":"3 weeks intervention:\n\n* 1 sessions of ESWT + 2 sessions of Sham, once a week\n* 6 sessions of passive stretching, twice a week","armGroupLabels":["Group II"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of two kind treatments proposed","description":"The intervention is feasible if at least 80% of the enrolled patients complete the entire treatment foreseen in the allocation group","timeFrame":"T1 after 4 weeks from T0 (Enrollment)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Walking Resistance","description":"6 minute walking test","timeFrame":"T0 Enrollment, T1 after 4 weeks from T0, T2 after 12 weeks from T0"},{"measure":"Change in Level of mobility and balance","description":"Timed Up \\& Go Test","timeFrame":"T0 Enrollment, T1 after 4 weeks from T0, T2 after 12 weeks from T0"},{"measure":"Change in spasticity","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).
