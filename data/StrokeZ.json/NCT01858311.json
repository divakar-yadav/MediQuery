This study is being conducted to determine the blood thinning and cholesterol lowering properties of TCT in stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack, which is also referred to as a \"mini-stroke\") survivors that are receiving the standard treatment for prevention of recurrent stroke.\n\nStudy Hypothesis: Oral TCT decreases the incidence of aspirin and clopidogrel nonresponders, increases the extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation, and decreases LDL without significant side effects in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"In this Phase IIB trial the goal is to determine the effects of orally supplemented TCT on platelet function and cholesterol as well as the safety in patients with TIA (transient ischemic attack) or stroke in addition to the standard treatment for stroke prevention. Recurrent cardiovascular events including stroke, TIA, heart attack, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, systemic embolism will also be recorded. In patients with recurrent stroke, severity of the stroke and stroke size measured from MR (magnetic resonance) or CT (computed tomography) imaging will also be collected. We expect that TCT will inhibit blood clotting and lower cholesterol more than current standard treatment without significantly increasing bleeding risks or other side effects. Future work is planned in a larger TIA/stroke population to examine whether TCT adds to standard medical care in terms of decreasing incidence of stroke and improving outcomes following stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke survivors","TIA survivors","Vitamin E","Carotech","Tocotrienol"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood Draw"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo vehicle","description":"(2) placebo capsules following AM meal and (2) placebo capsules following PM meal.","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo Vehicle"]},{"label":"Tocotrienol capsules (400 mg)","description":"(2) 100mg TCT capsules following AM meal and (2) 100mg TCT capsules following PM meal.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Tocotrienol Capsules"]},{"label":"Tocotrienol Capsules (800 mg)","description":"(2) 200mg TCT capsules following AM meal and (2) 200mg TCT capsules following PM meal.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Tocotrienol Capsules"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Tocotrienol Capsules","description":"Vitamin E TCT capsules- 400mg to 800mg per day (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening)","armGroupLabels":["Tocotrienol Capsules (800 mg)","Tocotrienol capsules (400 mg)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo Vehicle","description":"Placebo capsules per day (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening)","armGroupLabels":["Placebo vehicle"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"platelet aggregation activity","description":"Platelet aggregation activity will be measured using standard clinical laboratory procedures","timeFrame":"up to 1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of recurrent stroke","description":"Incidence of recurrent stroke after previous diagnosed stroke or TIA.","timeFrame":"up to 1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with either atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, cryptogenic stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) for whom anticoagulation is not indicated\n* Enrollment in trial must occur within 6 months of clinical presentation for first stroke or TIA event\n* No history of long-term vitamin E supplement (defined as daily oral tocopherol or tocotrienol supplementation at least 6mos;
