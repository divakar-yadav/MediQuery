Nowadays the procedure is associated with a very high success rate (\\> 95%) but major peri-procedural ischemic complications such as myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke occur in about 2% (0% to 17%) and 3% (2% to 7%) of the cases, respectively. The recently published PARTNER trial showed a stroke rate as high as 6.5% within the 30 days following TAVI, with most (77%) of these events diagnosed as major strokes. In order to avoid such ischemic complications full dose anticoagulation (usually intravenous heparin) is administered during the TAVI procedure, whereas aspirin (long-term) + clopidogrel (1 to 6 months) have been the recommended antithrombotic treatment following the procedure. However, this antithrombotic regime has been recommended on an empirical basis, and no studies have as yet shown the efficacy of aspirin + clopidogrel versus aspirin alone or no antithrombotic treatment in preventing ischemic events following TAVI procedures. Also, patients undergoing TAVI nowadays are usually octogenarians and very frequently exhibit comorbidities such as hypertension, abnormal renal function or prior cerebrovascular disease, which significantly increase the risk of major bleeding. Indeed, TAVI procedures can also be associated with major vascular complications which in turn can complicate with life-threatening or major bleeding. It is well know that clopidogrel on top of aspirin is associated with a higher rate of major bleeding complications, especially in elderly patients. It would therefore be of major clinical relevance to determine the risk/benefit ratio of using a dual antithrombotic therapy following TAVI procedures in order to recommend the most appropriate antithrombotic treatment in this high-risk population. The ARTE trial is a multicenter Canadian pilot trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin versus aspirin + clopidogrel as antithrombotic treatment after TAVI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke"],"keywords":["Transcatheter aortic valve implantation","Antithrombotic treatment","Clopidogrel","Aspirin","Myocardial Infarction","Ischemic stroke","Major bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":178,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aspirin + clopidogrel","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will be randomized within the month prior to the TAVI procedure to receive aspirin (80 mg/d) + clopidogrel (75 mg/d) following the TAVI procedure.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin (80 mg/d) + clopidogrel (75 mg/d)"]},{"label":"Aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will be randomized within the month prior to the TAVI procedure to receive aspirin (80 mg/d)","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin (80 mg/d) + clopidogrel (75 mg/d)","description":"Aspirin (80 mg/d) + clopidogrel (75 mg/d) Aspirin therapy will start at least 24 hrs before the TAVI procedure and continued for at least 6 months.
