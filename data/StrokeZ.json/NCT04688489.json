The study has an intervention group and a control group. The study is randomized, but not blinded. The primary outcome is level of function measured with Barthel-100. Besides the primary outcome there are several secondary outcomes (see detailed description). All patients are recruited from Rigshospitalet, Glostrup.","detailedDescription":"The study will investigate the potential effect of a supplement of maltodextrin (20 g for women and 30 g for men) and added dietary carbohydrates on the level of function in patients with apoplexia. The study has an intervention group and a control group. The study is randomized, but not blinded. The primary outcome is level of function measured with Barthel-100. Secondary outcomes are: training intensity, duration and frequency; length of stay; self-training (training without a therapist) and patient's experienced fatigue; and patient's experienced pain. All patients are recruited from Rigshospitalet, Glostrup. The supplement will be administered before and after each training session with a therapist. The supplement is a powder desolved in a glass of juice. The nursing staff will add extra carbohydrates to the patient's meals in the form of potatoes, rice, bread, fruit or other carbohydrate rich food items. All meals will be noted daily and validated the following day by the primary investigators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Apoplexy; Brain"],"keywords":["carbohydrates","rehabilitation","high-carbohydrate diet"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The intervention consists of a supplement of maltodextrin at training episodes combined with added dietary carbohydrates at all meals","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Carbloading and maltodextrin"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control receives no intervention.
