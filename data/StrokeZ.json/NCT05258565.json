Intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV alteplase) is currently the only proven effective medication for the treatment of AIS with promising adjuvant medications currently under investigation.(Gottula et al, 2021).\n\nIntravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used to treat acute stroke because of its thrombolytic activity and its ability to restore circulation to the brain. (Wang, et. al, 1998). However tPA administration, especially delayed administration is associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic transformation and mortality. (Jong, 2019) Acute cerebrovascular disease, particularly ischemic stroke, has emerged as a serious complication of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that caused by the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Such specificities include a propensity towards large vessel occlusion, multi-territory stroke, and involvement of otherwise uncommonly affected vessels. The pathogenesis and optimal management of ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, but emerging evidence suggest that cytokine storm-triggered coagulopathy and endotheliopathy represent possible targetable mechanisms. (Vogrig, et. al, 2021).\n\nAnew study was done in United States in 2020, included 13 patients presented with acute ischemic stroke and systemic symptoms consistent with covid-19 were treated with IV tPA. 61.5% of patients improved at follow up, Neither of them complicated with systemic or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages.(Carneiro, et. al, 2020). IV tPA may be safe and efficacious in COVID -19 but larger studies are needed to validate these results (Carneiro, et. al, 2020).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare between the safety and efficacy of tPA management of ischemic stroke in Covid-19 and non covid-19 patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"acute ischemic stroke without covid -19 infection","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Administration of IV tPA: the dose of activase is ,9 mg /kg (not exceeding 90 mg total treatment dose) Infused over 90 minutes.","interventionNames":["Drug: IV tPA (Activase)"]},{"label":"acute ischemic stroke associated with covid -19 infection","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Administration of IV tPA: the dose of activase is, 9 mg /kg (not exceeding 90 mg total treatment dose) Infused over 90 minutes.","interventionNames":["Drug: IV tPA (Activase)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"IV tPA (Activase)","description":"Any patients eligible came with acute ischemic stroke with or without COVID-19 infection within the time window for thrombolytic therapy (within 4 hours of onset)","armGroupLabels":["acute ischemic stroke associated with covid -19 infection","acute ischemic stroke without covid -19 infection"],"otherNames":["IV tissue plasminogen activator"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"primary out come","description":"Barthel Index scale BIS (pre-post drug administration and 2 month later)The Barthel includes 10 personal activities: feeding, personal toileting, bathing, dressing and undressing, getting on and off a toilet, controlling bladder, controlling bowel, moving from wheelchair to bed and returning, walking on level surface (or propelling a wheelchair if unable to walk) and ascending and descending stairs.\n\nThe original Index is a three-item ordinal rating scale completed by a therapist or other observer in 2-5 minutes. Each item is rated in terms of whether the patient can perform the task independently, with some assistance, or is dependent on help based on observation (0=unable, 1=needs help, 2=independent). The final score is x 5 to get a number on a 100 point score. Proposed guidelines for interpreting Barthel scores are that scores of 0-20 indicate \"total\" dependency, 21-60 indicate \"severe\" dependency, 61-90 indicate \"moderate\" dependency, and 91-99 indicates \"slight\" dependency.","timeFrame":"2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"secondary outcome","description":"NIHSS (pre-post drug administration and 2 month later a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke.
