Patients after stroke will be recruited to evaluate the rehabilitation effectiveness of the device assisted upper limb rehabilitation. Both patients with chronic stroke and subacute stroke will be investigated.","detailedDescription":"A new robotic arm, named mobile exo-neuro-musculo-skeleton, was developed for upper limb rehabilitation. The system integrated the advantages of exoskeleton, soft robot, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation. It is noninvasive, light in weight, comfortable to wear, and can support the motions at the elbow, the wrist and the fingers. The device is a mobile system interfaced with a mobile app by a user.\n\nThe device assisted upper limb rehabilitation will be applied to inpatients with subacute stroke. The rehabilitation effects on the motor restoration in the upper limb will be compared with the conventional physical and occupational therapies. The rehabilitation effects of the device assisted training also will be evaluated on patients with chronic stroke. The motor improvements after training will be investigated by comparing the pre- and post- clinical assessments. It is hypothesized that the device assisted upper limb rehabilitation will be effective in both subacute and chronic patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Limb Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["stroke","upper limb","Joint coordination"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The device assisted treatment will be administrated to patients with subacute stroke and chronic stroke.
