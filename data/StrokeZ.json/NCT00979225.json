The project seeks to improve care quality and safety in an ambulatory care setting through clinical decision support for evidence-based (EB) pharmacotherapy delivered as point-of-care reports to clinic-based practitioners and as population health-based alerts to care managers.\n\nThis project will build upon a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE) network created to connect providers serving 37,000 Medicaid beneficiaries from both rural and urban settings in a 5 county region in the Northern Piedmont of North Carolina. This network includes 16 private practices, 3 federally qualified health centers, 5 rural health centers, 3 urgent care facilities, 10 government agencies, 5 hospitals, and 2 cross-disciplinary care management teams.\n\nThe proposed information system will be based on an emerging standard for decision support and will utilize routinely available claims and scheduling data in order to serve as a replicable model for broader use of decision support for medication management. Increased availability and use of decision support tools for medication management can be expected to reduce medication errors, improve health care quality at an acceptable cost, and augment disease management for patients and populations.","detailedDescription":"The study will be conducted in accordance with the following four specific aims:\n\nAim 1: Expand the functionality of an existing decision support system in use within a regional HIE network to incorporate EB pharmacotherapy guidelines and to promote medication adherence. Primary care clinicians will receive EB pharmacotherapy suggestions and a patient-specific summary of prescription claims data delivered to the point-of-care via fax. Care managers will receive alerts delivered via email to encourage patients to arrange follow-up clinic appointments because of possible medication non-adherence.\n\nAim 2: Implement and evaluate the impact of the two interventions on adherence to EB pharmacotherapy recommendations among Medicaid patients with high priority conditions as designated by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in ambulatory care settings through a three-arm randomized controlled trial.\n\nAim 3: Compare resource utilization and assess the economic attractiveness (cost-savings or cost-effectiveness) of the interventions to promote medication adherence and EB pharmacotherapy.\n\nAim 4: Disseminate information regarding the development and impact of the interventions through Web teleconferences, professional meetings, educational lectures, and peer review journals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Diabetes Mellitus","Stroke","Myocardial Ischemia","Heart Failure","Asthma"],"keywords":["health
