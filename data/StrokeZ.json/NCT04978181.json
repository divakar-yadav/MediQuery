More than half (54.5%) of the 56.9 million deaths worldwide in 2106 were due to the top 10 causes.\n\nIschemic heart disease and stroke are the world's biggest killers, accounting for a combined 15.2 million deaths in 2106. These diseases have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.\n\nRecent clinical trials have shown that endo-vascular thrombectomy is an effective and safe recanalization modality for acute ischemic stroke patients .\n\nMeta-analysis results show that endovascular treatment is associated with a high ratio of successful recanalization rate and a low rate of symptomatic hemorrhage .\n\nApproximately 2.2-37.5% of patients with acute ischemic stroke might encounter early neurological deterioration (END).\n\nDefinition of END: An increase in NIHSS ≥4 or an increase in Ia of NIHSS ≥1 within 72 h after recanalization treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase Injection","description":"thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke in time window","otherNames":["thrombolysis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of early neurological deterioration after successful recanalization treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke","description":"Prevalence of early neurological deterioration after successful recanalization treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"factors of deterioration","description":"factors of deterioration","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
