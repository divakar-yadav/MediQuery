Recanalization treatments can prevent disability, but patients must be carefully selected. Knowledge in this field is evolving rapidly, which tends to make management more complex and personalized. In addition, the permanence of thrombolysis channels involves neurologists of all expertise. Decision support tools are desirable to enable precision medicine in stroke. Strokecopilot is a web application developed by the principal investigator. Its algorithm contextualizes the patient in a set of evidence-based medicine references (recommendations and clinical trials) and gives the result of their cross-referencing to the user to indicate theoretical indications for intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)"],"keywords":["cerebrovascular accident (CVA)","Ischemic stroke","thrombolysis channels","intravenous thrombolysis","mechanical thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Retrospective analysis of thrombolysis data for the development of an algorithm to detect thrombolysis","timeFrame":"Files analysed retrospectively from January 01, 2017 to December 31, 2021 will be examined"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n- Adult patient (\\>18 years old) admitted to the thrombolysis unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg from January 01, 2017 to December 31, 2021\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n- Subjects who have expressed their opposition to the use of their data for scientific research purposes.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adult patient (\\>18 years old) admitted to the thrombolysis unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Valérie WOLFF, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 85 19","email":"valerie.wolff@chru-strasbourg.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Valérie WOLFF, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Service : Unité Neurovasculaire - CHU de Strasbourg - France","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Stanislas DEMUTH, MD","affiliation":"Service : Unité Neurovasculaire - CHU de Strasbourg - France","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service : Unité Neurovasculaire - CHU de Strasbourg - France","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Strasbourg","zip":"67091","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Valérie WOLFF, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"33 3 88 12 85 19","email":"valerie.wolff@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"name":"Valérie WOLFF, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Stanislas DEMUTH, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Joris MULLER, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":48.58392,"lon":7.74553}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000004630","term":"Emergencies"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7486","name":"Emergencies","asFound":"Emergency","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
