It is unknown whether the choice of anesthesia is impacted on the outcomes for these patients or not. The investigators will perform a randomized controlled pilot clinical trial of general anesthesia versus local anesthesia/conscious sedation to explore and find out a potential fact whether anesthetic type alters perioperative neurological function in patients with acute ischemic stroke in posterior cerebral circulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Posterior Circulation Brain Infarction"],"keywords":["Anesthesia Methods","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":93,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Local anesthesia/conscious sedation","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients will be injected by propofol (adjusted by bispectral index scale ≥70 ) and /or remifentanil（0.01-0.06μg/kg/min）.
