The investigators hypothesize that compared to regular care the investigators will reduce alarm-to-needle time by a minimum of 20 minutes by implementation of the stroke emergency mobile unit.","detailedDescription":"Time from symptom onset is crucial for the effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients. Many patients receive tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) with considerable delay. The investigators developed an ambulance equipped with a CT-scanner, point-of-care laboratory, teleradiological support and an emergency trained neurologist on board. In the Pre-Hospital Acute Neurological Therapy and Optimization of Medical care in Stroke patients (PHANTOM-S)-study the investigators aim at a reduction of the current alarm-to-needle time by pre-hospital use of tissue Plasminogen Activator in an ambulance.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that compared to regular care we will reduce alarm-to-needle time by a minimum of 20 minutes by implementation of the stroke emergency mobile unit (STEMO).\n\nThis is a prospective study comparing randomly allocated periods with and without STEMO availability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","thrombolysis","prehospital","emergency medicine","suspected acute stroke","telemedicine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":614,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Regular Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Regular care for suspected stroke in Berlin consists of an ambulance with paramedics only, and neither computed tomography (CT) nor point-of-care diagnostics.
