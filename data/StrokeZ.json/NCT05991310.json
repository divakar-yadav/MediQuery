Daily periods of remote (telemedicine) or in person (onboard) neurologist assessments will be randomly determined using an adaptive design."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["mobile stroke unit","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The days in which the neurologist will be on or off the mobile stroke unit will be randomly determined. Randomization will be stratified by nurse category (Nurse Practitioner versus Clinical Nurse Consultant) with an adaptive component to balance the number of patients reviewed in person or via telemedicine within each nurse category.
