The study will be undertaken in two phases: a vanguard phase in 400 patients, to plan for a main phase in 2000 patients.","detailedDescription":"Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most serious subtypes of stroke, affecting approximately 2-3 million people worldwide each year. About one third of people with ICH die early after onset and the majority of survivors are left with major long-term disability. Administration of activated recombinant human Factor VII has been shown to limit haematoma expansion in randomised controlled clinical trials; however, future clinical use of this agent may be limited by a short therapeutic time window, contraindication in patients at risk of thromboembolism and high cost. Currently, no acute medical therapies have been shown to alter outcome in ICH and the role of surgery remains uncertain.\n\nBlood pressure (BP) levels are strongly and positively associated with the incidence of first and recurrent stroke and there is definite evidence that BP lowering reduces stroke risk. Although BP levels are commonly elevated after stroke onset, particularly in ICH, the effects of BP lowering treatment in the acute phase of stroke remain unknown.\n\nThe study aims to establish the effectiveness of a management policy of early intensive BP lowering on death \\& disability in patients with primary ICH compared to current guideline-based management of high BP in the clinical setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","Cerebral Hemorrhage","Intracranial Hemorrhages"],"keywords":["Clinical Trial","Blood Pressure","CVA (Cerebrovascular
