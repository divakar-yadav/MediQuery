Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a symptom of depression. Score range between 0-63 with higher score indicating greater severity. Normally completed in 5-10 minutes.","timeFrame":"Weeks 0, 9"},{"measure":"Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): change is being assessed","description":"The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a self-report 21-item scale for measuring anxiety. The questions ask about symptoms of anxiety the subject has had during the past week. Each question is scored between 0 (mild) and 3 (severe) and a total score will vary between 0-63. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.","timeFrame":"0, 9 weeks"},{"measure":". Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS): change is being assessed","description":"The DASS is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS scales contains 14 items, divided into subscales of 2-5 items with similar content. The Depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia. The Anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The Stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive and impatient. Subjects are asked to use 4-point severity/frequency scales to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week. Scores for Depression, Anxiety and Stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.","timeFrame":"Weeks 0, 9"},{"measure":"EQ-5D 5L: change is being assessed","description":"The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.","timeFrame":"Weeks 0, 9"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale (SIS): change is being assessed","description":"The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a self-report, health status measure for people affected by stroke. It was designed to assess strength, hand function, activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation. The SIS can be used both in clinical and research settings. It contains 59 items and assesses 8 domains. Each item is rated using a 5-point Likert scale. A final single-item question assesses the individual's perception of recovery from stroke, measured using a visual analogue scale, where 0 = no recovery \\& 100 = full recovery. The scale is normally completed in 15-20 minutes.","timeFrame":"Weeks 0, 9"},{"measure":"Focus group","description":"Focus Groups (FGs) will be used to collect qualitative data.","timeFrame":"Week 9"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged ≥18 years\n* Have had ≥1 stroke at least 3 months previously\n* Interested in learning skills to help cope with self-reported anxiety and/or depression\n* Able to speak and understand conversational English\n* Score ≥ 4 on either sub-scale Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\n* Desirable: Able to identify a family member/peer who would: like to take part, can speak and understand conversational English; not participating in another trial.\n\nPotential participants who do not identify someone else to take part with them will not be excluded.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior MBSR attendance in the last three years (as this may confound results)\n* Current participant in another trial\n* Cannot follow a 2-stage command","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Maggie Lawrence, Dr.","affiliation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Glasgow Caledonian University","city":"Glasgow","state":"Glasgow (City Of)","zip":"G4 0BA","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":55.86515,"lon":-4.25763}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"HELPING EASE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AFTER STROKE (HEADS: UP)","url":"https://www.cso.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/HIPS1663RPB.pdf"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000003863","term":"Depression"},{"id":"D000003866","term":"Depressive Disorder"},{"id":"D000001008","term":"Anxiety Disorders"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001526","term":"Behavioral Symptoms"},{"id":"D000019964","term":"Mood Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6748","name":"Depression","asFound":"Depression","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6751","name":"Depressive Disorder","asFound":"Depression","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4014","name":"Anxiety Disorders","asFound":"Anxiety","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4508","name":"Behavioral Symptoms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21525","name":"Mood Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4505","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14163","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M6082","name":"Complement System Proteins","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
