All nerves terminate on the fascia, where ASIS device can precisely deliver Botox by creating that subdermal bloodless space, between the skin and muscle. Thus enhancing and prolonging Botox's efficacy, at the same time prevent it's unnecessary adverse reactions and distant spread, especially since Botox has no reason to travel to the rest of the body any way.","detailedDescription":"Aim 1 over 6 months will demonstrate ASIS device's consistent performance on 60 adult subjects with Upper limb Spasticity. Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally (30) or conventional intramuscularly (30) for these 7 muscle groups: Biceps Brachii, Flexor Carpi Radialis, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, Adductor Pollicis, and Flexor Pollicis Longus. An MRI will be taken promptly after Gadolinium injection, as starting reference, to which subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs later will be compared for Persistent %. Since there isn't a way to measure level of Gadolinium within it, or any other (e.g. Botox) for that matter, at least the Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by the greater or longer Persistent % on MRI. However, this approximation can only work if the variables are minimized to the same population with Upper limb Spasticity, and these particular 7 muscle groups. Case in point, patients with Upper limb Spasticity presumably have hyperactivity in these 7 muscle groups, so expectantly will have shortened Gadolinium intramuscularly Persistent %, and somewhat reduced Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % as well due to agitation, thus these Persistent % values in Upper limb Spasticity patients will not be like those of normal patients, or even the same between these 7 different muscle groups. Therefore, the Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent % intramuscularly, will be specific and valuable indicators to help us modify the Botox dosage and duration to inject into that \"unknown\" subdermal bloodless space for Aim 2.\n\nAim 2 over 12 months, using Botox, instead of Gadolinium, to demonstrate the advantages of ASIS device subdermally over intramuscularly, for the same 60 adult subjects with Upper limb Spasticity, on these particular 7 muscle groups: Biceps Brachii, Flexor Carpi Radialis, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, Adductor Pollicis, and Flexor Pollicis Longus. Hypothetically speaking, if that subdermal bloodless space in patients with e.g., Upper limb Spasticity somehow failed to show prolongation of half-life for Gadolinium in Aim 1, we can still proceed with primary interest being therapeutic comparison for Botox in Aim 2, in terms of improvement on the Physician Global Assessment Scale and Ashworth score (force required to move an extremity around a joint), at 6,12,18,24, and 30 weeks, and reduction in adverse reactions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Limb Spasticity Unilaterally in Adults With History of Stroke","Increased Muscle Tone in Elbow, Wrist, Finger, and Thumb Flexors."],"keywords":["Subdermal bloodless space","Subdermal injection","injectable EMG needle","electrical stimulation","MRI with Gadolinium","Upper Limb Spasticity","intramuscular injection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Biceps Brachii","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Biceps Brachii (elbow flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Flexor Carpi Radialis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Flexor Carpi Radialis (wrist flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Flexor carpi ulnaris","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Flexor carpi ulnaris (wrist flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Flexor digitorum profundus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Flexor digitorum profundus (finger flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Flexor digitorum sublimis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Flexor digitorum sublimis (finger flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Adductor pollicis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Adductor pollicis (thumb flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Flexor pollicis longus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Flexor pollicis longus (thumb flexors)\n\nGadolinium Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine)\n\n.1cc/ diluted with .9ccNS intramuscularly for 30 patients, and subdermally with ASIS Device for 30 patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gadolinium"]},{"label":"Change from Baseline in Elbow Ashworth","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Change from Baseline in Elbow Ashworth Scale as Efficacy of Botox intramuscularly at Week 6, Efficacy of Botox intramuscularly at Week 12, Efficacy of Botox intramuscularly at Week 18, Efficacy of Botox intramuscularly at Week 24, and Efficacy of Botox intramuscularly at Week 30 vs.Efficacy of Botox subdermally at Week 6, Efficacy of Botox subdermally at Week 12, Efficacy of Botox subdermally at Week 18, Efficacy of Botox subdermally at Week 24, and Efficacy of Botox subdermally at Week 30.
