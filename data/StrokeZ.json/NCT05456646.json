In addition, prestroke sarcopenia is associated with worse functional outcomes in patients with stroke. Temporal muscle thickness (TMT) has recently been proposed as a new marker of whole-body muscle mass and function. Measurement of temporal muscle mass by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been studied in the literature in recent years. All stroke patients undergo cranial CT or MRI examinations at the time of admission. By evaluating the temporal muscle mass of these patients with these examinations, information about pre-stroke muscle mass and sarcopenia can be obtained. Ultrasonography (USG), on the other hand, may be a more accessible, less expensive, and safer option for assessing muscle mass in the follow-up of stroke patients. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between sarcopenia and functional outcomes with temporal muscle mass change by MRI/CT at admission and by USG in the chronic period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Sarcopenia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Scale","description":"This scale consists of six levels of function, ranging from 0 ( non-ambulatory ) to 5 (independently ambulatory).","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Scale","description":"This scale consists of six levels of function, ranging from 0 ( non-ambulatory ) to 5 (independently ambulatory).","timeFrame":"6. month"},{"measure":"The Functional Independence Measure (FIM)","description":"FIM is a scale that assesses 18 activities, including self-care, sphincter control, transfer, movement, communication, and social awareness.
