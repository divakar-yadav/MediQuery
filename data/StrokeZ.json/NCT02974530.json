In the context of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, these are altered, isolated or associated manner, causing major disorders and representing a source of handicap for patients.\n\nUnderstanding the swallowing mechanisms is therefore a major challenge to guide the rehabilitation and improve the initial and long-term prognosis of patients with stroke.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to describe and modeling, thanks to a clinical, physiological and radiological knowledge base, swallowing, speech and breathing, in patients with stroke and in healthy subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Swallowing
