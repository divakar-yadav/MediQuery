We believe this intervention will reduce medication errors, ensure follow-up discharge plans, decrease re-hospitalization rates, and decrease morbidity and mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COPD","Coronary Artery Disease","Diabetes Mellitus","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients admitted to the ACE unit during the study time frame, age 65 and over, and residing in the community before and after discharge from the hospital. Selected patients will have complex discharge plans including referrals to home care agencies, poly-pharmacy, multiple co-morbidities, history of repeated hospitalizations, and poor social support systems in the community. In addition, eligible patients will have at least one of eight admitting diagnoses, chosen for their high likelihood of requiring post-discharge home care needs. These diagnosis include: CHF, COPD, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, hip fracture, peripheral vascular disease or cardiac arrhythmia. The GNP or fellow will then request permission from the patient's primary physician to do a one-time post-discharge home visit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients discharged to settings other than their homes (i.e. nursing home, sub-acute rehabilitation, etc.)Patients discharged to settings other than their homes (i.e. nursing home, sub-acute rehabilitation, etc.)","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Although IRB approval was received, study was not initiated.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Aleksandra Zagorin, MA, GNP-C, ANP-C","affiliation":"Maimonides Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6805","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4159","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
