Based on clinical observations and literature review, investigators assume participants's DS-MV score high correlation with PHQ-9 score.","detailedDescription":"The Chinese version of Demoralization Scale-Mandarin Version (DS-MV) was used to assess the mental state of patients with stroke after debridement. The statistical analysis test of correlation is carried out, and the reliability and validity test and the norm establishment of the Chinese version are further tested. Convenient sampling will be performed at a single medical facility. The planned implementation period is 2019/01/01 \\~ 2019/12/31, and the location of the case is the rehabilitation ward and outpatient clinic of Taoyuan Hospital. The diagnosis must be: intensive stroke or hemorrhagic brain within three years. In the case of a 20- to 100-year-old clinical patient with stroke, the subject should explain the content of the case, and the subject will complete the test consent form after informed consent, and then begin the evaluation process of the self-assessment questionnaire. The assessment procedure is preceded by a clinical psychologist conducting with MMSE test to determine the cognitive function. When the patient's consciousness is blurred, the simple intelligent state test (MMSE) score less than 24 points, aphasia can not be effectively communicated, the diagnosis of mental illness or mental disorder has been recorded on the medical record, or the patient or family member is unwilling to sign the informed consent form. If the above situation is met, subjects will be excluded. The self-assessment questionnaire will obtain the scores of the subjects in the Chinese version of the Demoralization Scale-Mandarin Version (DS-MV) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
