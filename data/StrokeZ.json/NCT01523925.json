CIT/dCIT involves massed practice of the affected arm and restraint of the unaffected arm. BAT involves repetitive practice of symmetrical bilateral movements on robot. Both are evident to improve motor performance, motor control or daily function in high functioning patients. These dCIT and BAT have their own limitations for motor-deficit rehabilitation after stroke, i.e. only appropriate for high-functioning or mildly motor impaired patients. Functional electrical therapy, an innovative technology, is proposed as an adjunct to these behavioral approaches to assist in movement execution. Functional electrical therapy is used to increase the electric activity of muscles for movement and the active range of motion in low functioning patients. Combining functional electrical therapy into CIT or BAT may extend the utility of these two behavioral approaches beyond patients with mild motor deficits and could expedite the progress of motor recovery. This project attempts to perform a randomized controlled trial to verify the efficacy and motor control mechanism of the proposed combined functional electrical therapy with dCIT or with BAT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Functional electrical therapy","Bilateral arm training","Constraint induced therapy","Stroke rehabilitation","Clinical evaluation","Kinematic analysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Combined dCIT with FET","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combined distributed constraint induced therapy with functional electrical therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: dCIT","Behavioral: Functional electrical stimulation"]},{"label":"Combined BAT with FET","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combined bilateral arm treatment with functional electrical therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: BAT","Behavioral: Functional electrical stimulation"]},{"label":"Control intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control intervention","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Control intervention group"]},{"label":"dCIT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"distributed constraint induced therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: dCIT"]},{"label":"BAT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"bilateral arm treatment","interventionNames":["Behavioral: BAT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"dCIT","description":"This dCIT group focuses on restriction on movement of the unaffected hand by placement of the hand in a mitt for 6 hours/day and intensive training of the affected upper extremity in functional tasks 1.5 hours/weekday, for 4 weeks.
