It showed that the excitability following multisite HD-tDCS was more than double the increase following conventional tDCS. To consider the various lesion site of different stroke survivors. The electrode placements based on personalized lesion profiles and anatomical features can be determined using finite element modeling, with lesion profiles generated from fMRI and advanced algorithms calculating the current density to maximize the modulation effect. Combining motor network interaction and the new multisite electrode montage may further provide a potential to facilitate stroke recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Multisite HD-tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Constant current will be applied for 20min and the electrodes will be placed over the target area","interventionNames":["Device: multisite HD-tDCS"]},{"label":"Conventional tDCS Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Constant current (1mA) will be applied for 20min and the anode will be placed over the standard C3/C4 position","interventionNames":["Device: Conventional tDCS"]},{"label":"Sham HD-tDCS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The stimulator will be applied for 20 minutes with only 30s ramp-up and ramp-down stimulation delivered.","interventionNames":["Device: Conventional tDCS"]},{"label":"multisite HD-tDCS with EMG-driven robot hand group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The stimulation electrodes are fixed on the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex according to the brain activation map detected by task based fMRI.","interventionNames":["Device: multisite HD-tDCS EMG-driven robot hand"]},{"label":"Sham HD-tDCS EMG-driven robot hand group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The stimulator will be applied for 20 minutes with only 30s ramp-up and ramp-down stimulation delivered.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham HD-tDCS EMG-driven robot hand"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"multisite HD-tDCS","description":"5-8 sintered Ag/AgCl ring electrodes will be placed based on the neuroimaging and computation modelling.
