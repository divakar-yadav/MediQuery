During anodal tDCS, participants will receive 20 min at 2mA over motor cortex (with 30 seconds of ramp-up and ramp-down).","deathsNumAffected":0,"deathsNumAtRisk":4,"seriousNumAffected":0,"seriousNumAtRisk":4,"otherNumAffected":2,"otherNumAtRisk":4},{"id":"EG001","title":"Sham tDCS","description":"Sham stimulation will be performed by turning the stimulator off after the initial sensory experience (30 seconds).","deathsNumAffected":0,"deathsNumAtRisk":2,"seriousNumAffected":0,"seriousNumAtRisk":2,"otherNumAffected":1,"otherNumAtRisk":2}],"otherEvents":[{"term":"headache","organSystem":"General disorders","assessmentType":"NON_SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":2,"numAtRisk":4},{"groupId":"EG001","numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":2}]},{"term":"Rolled ankle","organSystem":"Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders","assessmentType":"NON_SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":4},{"groupId":"EG001","numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":2}]},{"term":"knee pain","organSystem":"Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders","assessmentType":"NON_SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":4},{"groupId":"EG001","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":2}]},{"term":"CABG surgery","organSystem":"Cardiac disorders","assessmentType":"NON_SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":4},{"groupId":"EG001","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":2}]}]},"moreInfoModule":{"certainAgreement":{"piSponsorEmployee":true},"pointOfContact":{"title":"Mark Mennemeier, PhD","organization":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences","email":"msmennemeier@uams.edu","phone":"15015267773"}}},"documentSection":{"largeDocumentModule":{"largeDocs":[{"typeAbbrev":"Prot_SAP","hasProtocol":true,"hasSap":true,"hasIcf":false,"label":"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan","date":"2014-11-21","uploadDate":"2018-10-01T14:55","filename":"Prot_SAP_000.pdf","size":672916}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":true}
