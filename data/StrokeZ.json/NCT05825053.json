However, the ability to adapt gait patterns to meet environmental demands remains impaired in a majority of people in the chronic phase after stroke. This impaired gait adaptability has a profound impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Treatment targeting gait adaptability is therefore critical for safe and independent community ambulation in people with stroke. Augmented or virtual reality in rehabilitation programs can be used to train gait adaptability in a controlled situation. A few studies have evaluated gait adaptability training in people with stroke. Although results were promising, these studies did not include an adaptability-related outcome measure, or were limited to uncontrolled or small-scaled pilot studies. Moreover, it is unknown if beneficial training effects can be fostered for 1 year after completion of a training program. We evaluate the short-term effects of a 5-week gait adaptability training in an adequately powered, waiting-list controlled clinical trial \\[ref naar clin trial nummer\\]. In the current study, we focus on the retention of potentially beneficial effects of this 5 week gait adaptability training program. We will evaluate if short-term effects of gait adaptability training can be retained through single training sessions to boost performance, or by an home exercise program. We hypothesize that booster sessions and home-based exercise will both yield better retention of training effects at 1 year follow-up as compared to the control arm without an experimental intervention.\n\nObjective: The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that retention of training-induced gains in gait adaptability can be fostered by providing booster sessions or by prescribing home-based training.\n\nStudy design: Explorative randomized study, comparing the effect of 3 1-hr booster training sessions against home-based exercise against no intervention on gait adaptability performance 1 year after completion of a 5-week gait adaptability training program.\n\nStudy population: Stroke patients in the chronic phase after stroke, who completed the 5-week gait adaptability training using the C-Mill and agreed to continue in this follow-up study. We expect this to be 50-75 participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Booster group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants assigned to the booster group will receive a three single training sessions 3 months apart targeting gait adaptability using the C-mill.
