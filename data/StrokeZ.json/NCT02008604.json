For this, the composition of gut microbiota in stool samples will be analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. Further, the correlation of stroke-associated changes in the microbiome with immunological parameters will be analyzed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)"],"keywords":["ischemia","stroke","transient ischemic attack (TIA)","microbiome","microbiota","gut"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Stool samples, Blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients"},{"label":"TIA patients","description":"patients with a transient ischemic attack (control group)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"composition of intestinal microbiome","description":"The composition of the intestinal metagenome / microbiome will be determined by analyzing the 16S rRNA by 454 Pyrosequencing.","timeFrame":"change between day 1, day 4, day 7, day 14 after stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"test of correlation between most changed group of bacteria with changes in immunological parameters (HLA-DR)","description":"Analysis of correlation between changes in microbiome (most changed group of bacteria, e.g. lactobacilli) with changes in immunological parameters (e.g. HLA-DR, IL-6, IL-10, CD4-lymphocytes from blood samples).","timeFrame":"days 1, 4, 7 after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age: 18 and older\n* ischemic cerebral infarction within the last 40 hours, anterior circulation infarct (ACA, MCA) and/or posterior circulation infarct (PCA, BA) of any severity\n* patient consent or consent by a legal representative\n* NIHSS \\> or =9 (stroke patients)\n* NIHSS \\< 1 (for TIA patients)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* intracranial hemorrhage\n* preexisting dysphagia\n* signs of infection upon admission (clinical/paraclinical)\n* existing antibiotic therapy upon admission or within the last 2 weeks before admission\n* mechanical ventilation upon admission\n* participation in an interventional therapy study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients at the rescue center, the Stroke Unit and the neurological intensive care unit of the Charité University hospital","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Andreas Meisel, Prof. Dr.","affiliation":"Charite University, Berlin, Germany","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Charite Universitätsmedizin Berlin","city":"Berlin","zip":"10117","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.52437,"lon":13.41053}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
