It has been reported in a large number of literatures that body position has an effect on hemodynamics, but the effect of different body positions on the hemodynamics of patients undergoing ultra-early reperfusion therapy is not clear. In this study, we hypothesized that the hemodynamics of patients undergoing ultra-early reperfusion therapy would differ between different positions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Zero position","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"All monitoring was done from 9 to 11 a.m., and the whole monitoring process was carried out in a specific and quiet environment at 20-24℃ to avoid other auditory and visual stimuli.
