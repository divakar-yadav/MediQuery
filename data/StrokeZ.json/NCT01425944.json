The focus of this project is on Sturge-Weber Syndrome.\n\nWe plan to improve the future understanding and treatment of Sturge-Weber Syndrome by 1) establishing a national consortium database which will gather lager amounts of clinical data and serve indirectly as a registry to foster future clinical trials and determine the usefulness of urine vascular biomarkers to determine the vascular remodeling of the SWS birthmark and choroidal angioma, 2) study vascular remodeling with retrospective and prospective neuroimaging to determine the vascular remodeling of the deep draining intraparenchymal vessels as it relates to SWS neurologic status, and 3) relate the GNAQ mutation to altered phosphorylation of pathway proteins and angiogenesis factors in SWS tissue."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sturge-Weber Syndrome"],"keywords":["Sturge Weber Syndrome","Biomarkers","DNA arrays","brain vessel malformations"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Aim 1 retains data and samples without DNA.
