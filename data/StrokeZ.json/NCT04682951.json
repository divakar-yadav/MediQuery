treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension after various etiologies : malignant ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis.\n\nInitially considered as a lifesaving therapy, benefits in terms of survival were shown compared to medical treatment alone.\n\nHowever, despite a better survival, morbidity and poor neurological outcome are frequent among survivors.\n\nThe objective of the study is to identify initial good neurological outcome factors after decompressive craniectomy in a large series of patients, in order to argue surgical and intensive care decisions, considering expected benefit and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Decompressive Craniectomy","Brain
