This treatment is called \"stereotactic radiosurgery dorsal rhizotomy.\" It uses very accurate beams of radiation to target certain nerves in the back to help loosen up the muscles. In this study, people are put into two groups by chance: one group gets the real treatment, and the other group gets a \"fake\" treatment that doesn't do anything. This fake treatment is called a \"sham.\" Doing this helps make sure the study is fair and the results are true. After the people in the study get their treatment, the researchers will watch and see how they do. They will check if their muscles are less stiff and if they have any side effects. By looking at the results from both groups, the researchers can find out if the special treatment really helps people with spasticity. Patients who got the \"fake\" treatment will be eligible to receive the \"real\" treatment after 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke","Spastic Cerebral Palsy","Spasticity, Muscle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sham Treatment","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"No intervention but can crossover after 6 months","interventionNames":["Other: Sham"]},{"label":"SRS Treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Radiation: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dorsal root rhizotomy radiomodulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dorsal root rhizotomy radiomodulation","description":"Patients will be simulated in the supine position in an immobilization apparatus deemed by the treating physician to be appropriate for the patient being able to comfortably maintain position for the duration of treatment.
