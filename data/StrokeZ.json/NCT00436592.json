The NeuroFlo device is intended to increase blood flow to the brain and potentially reduce the damage caused by stroke.","detailedDescription":"The study is a prospective, single arm treatment feasibility trial to determine the baseline safety and feasibility of the NeuroFlo device in acute ischemic stroke patients whose last known time symptom-free is between 8-24 hours.\n\nA maximum of 25 patients at 5 US sites and 25 patients at 10 Canadian \\& European sites may be enrolled in this initial study phase. An independent data safety and monitoring board will assess the safety of the treatment on a routine basis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["acute","ischemic","stroke","device","treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: NeuroFlo™ Catheter"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NeuroFlo™ Catheter","description":"45 minute Treatment","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of all adverse events from baseline to 30 days post-treatment.","timeFrame":"30 Days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Potential benefit will be assessed through collection of neurological indices at baseline, post-procedure, 24 hours, day 4 (or discharge), 30 and 90 days.","timeFrame":"90 Days"},{"measure":"Cerebral perfusion changes associated with device therapy will be assessed using MRI perfusion studies acquired at baseline and ≤ 4 hours post-procedure.","timeFrame":"≤ 4 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke\n* NIHSS between 4-20\n* Time from symptom onset between 8 and 24 hours\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hemorrhagic stroke\n* Certain types of heart disease\n* Kidney disease\n* Other conditions the doctor will assess","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Flo 24 Steering Committee","affiliation":"Multiple Organizations","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UCLA","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California","zip":"90024","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":34.05223,"lon":-118.24368}},{"facility":"Massachusetts General Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02114","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}},{"facility":"University of Rochester","city":"Rochester","state":"New York","zip":"14642","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":43.15478,"lon":-77.61556}},{"facility":"University of North Carolina","city":"Chapel Hill","state":"North Carolina","zip":"27514","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":35.9132,"lon":-79.05584}},{"facility":"University of Pittsburgh","city":"Pittsburgh","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"15213","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.44062,"lon":-79.99589}},{"facility":"University of Calgary","city":"Calgary","state":"Alberta","zip":"T2N 2T9","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05011,"lon":-114.08529}},{"facility":"University of Alberta","city":"Edmonton","state":"Alberta","zip":"T6G 2B7","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":53.55014,"lon":-113.46871}},{"facility":"University of Erlangen","city":"Erlangen","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":49.59099,"lon":11.00783}},{"facility":"University of Essen","city":"Essen","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":51.45657,"lon":7.01228}},{"facility":"CHUV Lausanne","city":"Lausanne","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":46.516,"lon":6.63282}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"22264202","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Hammer MD, Schwamm L, Starkman S, Schellinger PD, Jovin T, Nogueira R, Burgin WS, Sen S, Diener HC, Watson T, Michel P, Shuaib A, Dillon W, Liebeskind DS.
