Delayed corticosteroid treatment is given only for those demonstrating disease progression and is initiated as soon as the progression is detected (at any time after randomization). All participants will also receive standard of care therapy (aspirin and supportive care). Sites will randomize participants 1:1 to Arm A or B. Participants will be enrolled and randomized as soon as possible after their stroke/TIA up until 96 hours following the initial stroke/TIA event.","detailedDescription":"FCA is an acute, monophasic, presumed inflammatory disease that causes unilateral stenosis of the intracranial anterior circulation. In the medical literature, it has also been called transient cerebral arteriopathy (TCA) and post-varicella arteriopathy when it occurs after chicken pox. Although rare (1 to 3 cases seen per year at a typical academic children's hospital in the US), it is one of the most common causes of arterial ischemic stroke in a previously healthy child. Pediatric stroke investigators identified an FCA treatment trial as the #1 priority of the field (Steinlin M, Dev Med Child Neurol 2017) because of its aggressive natural history: it often progresses dramatically over days to weeks with recurrent or expanding infarcts. A 2017 European retrospective cohort study suggested that corticosteroid treatment may improve outcomes for FCA (Steinlin M, Stroke 2017).\n\nEuropeans have begun the PASTA (Paediatric Arteriopathy STeroid Aspirin) trial (PI Steinlin): a \"gold-standard\" RCT to test the efficacy of corticosteroids for FCA. A 2018 survey of pediatric stroke investigators (participating in the NIH-funded Vascular effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke, VIPS II, cohort study) revealed discomfort with randomization to \"no steroids\" as the majority now treat FCA with corticosteroids. However, despite attitudes favoring their use, corticosteroids were given to only 36% of 55 children with suspected FCA in the VIPS II cohort and (when given) were started a median of 3 days post-stroke (IQR 1.5, 6) (unpublished preliminary data). This incongruity reflects diagnostic uncertainty at stroke baseline: the characteristic arteriopathy evolution is needed for definitive diagnosis of FCA, and â‰ˆ1 in 5 children with suspected FCA at baseline have an alternate diagnosis. Hence, the pressing clinical question is: Should we treat all children with suspected FCA immediately or wait and treat only the subset that demonstrate disease progression?\n\nEarly treatment has the potential advantage of preventing FCA progression, but the disadvantage of over treatment of those with alternate diagnoses. With a comparative effectiveness approach, the FOCAS trial will compare these two treatment approaches. FOCAS will also collect the steroid treatment safety data needed to guide clinical decisions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pediatric Stroke","Arteriopathy","Arterial Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["FCA","Focal cerebral arteriopathy","Pediatric stroke","Arterial ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Because corticosteroids cause significant behavioral effects in children, the local study investigators cannot be effectively blinded to the treatment; however, one of the study biostatisticians and all personnel reviewing neuroimaging as a part of the neuroimaging core will be blinded to Study Arm assignment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Treat all children with suspected FCA with corticosteroids as soon as the diagnosis is made.","interventionNames":["Drug: methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone"]},{"label":"Arm B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Treat only the subset of children that develop evidence of FCA disease progression.","interventionNames":["Drug: methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone","description":"Any generic or brand-name methylprednisolone at the appropriate dose may be used.
