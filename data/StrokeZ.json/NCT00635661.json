The STREAM is used to evaluate recovery of voluntary movement and basic mobility following the onset of a stroke. Several important clinical measurement properties of the STREAM remain to be explored, including its ability to measure impairments and clinical change in acute rehabilitation patients in the USA. We hypothesize that the STREAM will be able to detect and quantify a statistically significant change in the motor abilities of stroke patients from admission to discharge. An additional aim of the study is to compare the STREAM with two accepted and widely used clinical measures of function and disability, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). By linking movement deficits that are commonly assessed by physical therapists with measures of function and disability, the impact of the movement deficits can be understood."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["function","disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM)","description":"The STREAM measures quality of movements in the arm and leg, and the quality of mobility during important functional tasks, such as walking 10 feet.
