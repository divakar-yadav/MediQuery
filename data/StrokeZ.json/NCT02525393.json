The first group received two weeks of daily session of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS, 10 sessions) and, at least 6 months after, two weeks of daily transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS, 10 sessions); the second group received 10 daily session of tDCS and, after at least 6 months, 10 sessions of rTMS; the control group received 10 daily session of sham tDCS.\n\nPhysiatric evaluations (ARAT scale), neuropsychological assessment and ERP (P300) were performed before (1 week) and after (1 week) the end of each treatment. Furthermore, all patients underwent follow-up neuropsychological assessment 6 months after the end of each stimulation period and follow-up physiatric evaluation at 3 and 6 months after the end of each stimulation period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Non Invasive Brain Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS+rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke patients were treated with an initial two weeks of transcranial direct current stimulation and after six months with two weeks of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Device: rTMS"]},{"label":"rTMS+tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke patients were treated with an initial two weeks of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and after six months with two weeks of transcranial direct current stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Device: rTMS"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Stroke patients were treated with two weeks of sham transcranial direct current stimulation.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"Stroke rehabilitation performed with the aid of a transcranial electrical stimulation device.","armGroupLabels":["rTMS+tDCS","tDCS+rTMS"],"otherNames":["HDC Stim device Newronica"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"rTMS","description":"Stroke rehabilitation performed with the aid of a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation device.","armGroupLabels":["rTMS+tDCS","tDCS+rTMS"],"otherNames":["PowerMAG 100 MAG&More"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham","description":"Stroke sham stimulation performed with the aid of a transcranial electrical stimulation device.","armGroupLabels":["Sham stimulation"],"otherNames":["HDC Stim device Newronica"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from the baseline ARAT (measures Grasp, Grip, Pinch, Gross Movement)","description":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measures Grasp, Grip, Pinch, Gross Movement.
