Next, participants will be measured during three training sessions with the Ekso GT SmartAssist:\n\n* 20-minute training with high swing assistance\n* 20-minute training with neutral swing assistance\n* 20-minute training with high swing resistance\n\nTrainings will be performed on a separate day in a randomized order (within one week and controlled for time of day).\n\nFollowing settings will be used in all three conditions: sitting program (\"Min lean\"); standing program (\"Auto lean\"); step initiation program (\"ProStep+\"), training mode (\"Off\"), SmartAssist option (\"2Free\"); and stance support (\"Low\"). The level of stance support and swing assistance will be set symmetrically for the affected and non-affected side.\n\nDuring training, participants will walk back and forth at a self-selected walking speed in a 30m hall way using a cane at the non-affected side.\n\nPrior to the experimental conditions, participants will have had three training sessions in the Ekso GT.\n\nRESTRICTIONS \\& PROHIBITIONS: Participants will be instructed to not consume food, alcohol, caffeine or nicotine at least 3h prior to the intervention. Usual medication intake will be allowed with small amounts of water.\n\nMATERIALS: The Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton with SmartAssist (Ekso Bionics Inc., USA) will be used during the overground training sessions.\n\nA flexible facemask (adult facemask, small/medium, Cortex, Germany), lightweight chest carrying gas analysis system (Metamax 3B, Cortex, Germany) and Bluetooth heart rate belt (Polar H7, Polar Electro, Finland) will be used to measure metabolic and cardiorespiratory parameters. At the start of each measurement, gas (room air and reference gas (17.4% O2 and 5.1% CO2)) and volume (3L syringe) calibrations of the breath-by-breath gas analysis system will be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nOUTCOMES: See section \"Outcome Measures\"\n\nDATA-ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics will be calculated for baseline patient characteristics. To investigate the effect of level of swing assistance and duration, a repeated measures ANOVA (within factor duration and within factor assistance level) will be conducted (interaction-effect time x duration, main effect assistance level and main effect duration). In case of significant differences, posthoc analyses will be interpreted. The walking speed will be considered as a covariate in the ANOVA analysis (in case significant different between conditions). Significance level will be set at 5%."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Wearable Exoskeleton","Stroke","Energy Consumption","Cardiorespiratory
