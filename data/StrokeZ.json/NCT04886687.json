The registry started in June 2019 and therefore incorporates the more recent device technology","detailedDescription":"The study inclusion criteria are the following: age ≥18 years; confirmed large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation (intracranial internal carotid artery M1, proximal M2 segments, time from last seen well to treatment (TLSWT) \\<24 hours, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥2, and premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤2. All participating centers received institutional review board approval from their respective institutions and patients or representatives signed informed consent. The study data are collected prospectively through an online questionnaire. Type of stent-retriever , as long as European Community approved, is at the discretion of the operator.\n\nThe primary clinical outcome is the rate of excellent clinical outcome, defined as mRS score 0-1 at 90 days (no or minor symptoms but no functional limitations).\\[28\\] The primary technical outcome is the rate of first pass effect (FPE) defined as achieving near-complete/complete revascularization \\[modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI 2c-3)\\] after single-device and single-pass approach"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thrombectomy","Stroke","Ischemic"],"keywords":["mechanical thrombectomy","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"mechanical thrombectomy","description":"mechanical thrombectomy"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical Outcome","description":"modified Rankin Score, 0 to 6, higher scores mean a worse outcome","timeFrame":"3 months after thrombectomy"},{"measure":"Technical Outcome","description":"Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale, 0 to 3, higher scores mean a better outcome","timeFrame":"1 day, revascularization grade will be assessed"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age ≥18 years;\n* confirmed large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation (intracranial internal carotid artery, M1segment of middle cerebral artery, proximal M2 segment of middle cerebral artery\n* time from last seen well to treatment (TLSWT) \\<24 hours,\n* baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥2,\n* premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤2.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No evidence vessel occlusion.\n* Extra and Intracranial occlusion or severe stenosis.\n* Low platelets (100 x 10000) or impaired function,\n* Contraindication of computed tomography or magnetic resonance\n* Allergy to iodinated contrast non treatable medically,\n* pregnant or breast feeding patient,\n* hemorrhagic stroke on computed tomography or Magnetic Resonance","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jordi B Blasco Andaluz, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34607586810","email":"30018jba@gmail.com"},{"name":"Luis San Roman Manzanera, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+34932275400","phoneExt":"2662","email":"lroman1@clinic.cat"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jordi Blasco Andaluz, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Barcelona","state":"Catalunya","zip":"08036","country":"Spain","contacts":[{"name":"Jordi Blasco, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"34 607586810","email":"30018jba@gmail.com"},{"name":"Jordi Blasco, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
