This screening procedure follows a specific work concerning undernutrition in thrombolyzed patients (NCT03303820). This work was motivated by the fact that, despite a high frequency of undernutrition in the hospital (at least 30% of patients), undernutrition in neurovascular unit is studied very little. A cohort of thrombolysed patients in 2014 was studied retrospectively. Patients malnourished at the entrance had a non-significant, less good recovery of their stroke (+ 1 Rankin score point at 3 months in malnourished patients at the entrance).","detailedDescription":"The main objective of this project is to assess, prospectively, the frequency of undernutrition at the entrance to the neurovascular intensive care unit and to evaluate the implementation of the undernutrition screening procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients in neurovascular intensive care","description":"During the patient's hospitalization in neurovascular intensive care unit, the doctor will propose to the patient to take part in this study.
