With the significant effects of reducing the cerebral ischemic damage and eventually improving patients' clinical outcomes, by the potential mechanisms of promoting microcirculation, as well as releasing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and poststroke inflammation, dl-NBP has been widely applied in acute ischemic stroke as an anti-ischemic drug in China since 2002. While with the evolution of using iv. recombinant tissue plasminogen activator（rtPA ）and mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke（AIS）patients, it is still undefined whether combination therapy with dl-NBP could enhance the curative effect. The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the recovery of neurological deficits in AIS patients who receive iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy with the a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy versus a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and followed by Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy.","detailedDescription":"This trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled, multiple-center trial. A total of approximately 1200 patients (Age≥18years) within 6 hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who shows NIHSS from 4-25 points and intend to be treated with iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content, meanwhile the first injection will be within 6 hours from stroke onset : 1) one group will receive Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days, then take Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy; 2) the other group will receive Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and then take Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy. The primary objective is to explore whether the dl-NBP can improve the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome after receiving iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy. The study consists of four visits including the day of randomization, 2 days after the first injection, 14 days when the injection therapy is done, and 30, 60 and 90 days when the oral therapy is finished. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the program. The favorable outcome based on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score was adjusted for baseline stroke severity, which was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 in patients with a baseline NIHSS core of 4 to 7, a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 in patients with a baseline NIHSS score of 8 to 14, and a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 in patients with a baseline NIHSS score of 15 to 25. The trial is anticipated to last from June 2018 to December 2022 with 1200 subjects recruited form 36 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["AIS","butylphthalide","mechanical thrombectomy","iv-rtPA","recovery of dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1216,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Butylphthalide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drug: Butylphthalide Sodium Chloride Injection and Butylphthalide Soft Capsules","interventionNames":["Drug: Butylphthalide"]},{"label":"Placebos","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Drug: Butylphthalide Placebo Injection and Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules","interventionNames":["Drug: Butylphthalide Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Butylphthalide","description":"This group will receive a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest Day 15 to Day 90.","armGroupLabels":["Butylphthalide"],"otherNames":["dl-NBP"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Butylphthalide Placebo","description":"This group will receive a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest Day 15 to Day 90.","armGroupLabels":["Placebos"],"otherNames":["Blank"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Favorable outcome","description":"A modified Rankin Scale score of 0 in patients with a baseline NIHSS core of 4 to 7, a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 in patients with a baseline NIHSS score of 8 to 14, and a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 in patients with a baseline NIHSS score of 15 to 25.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological recovery","description":"The difference value of the NIHSS between Day 14/Day 90 and the baseline","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Cerebral infarction volume","description":"Cerebral infarction volume at the Day 14 of the therapy","timeFrame":"14 days"},{"measure":"Recanalization rate","description":"Recanalization rate at the first 24 hours during the therapy","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"The percentage of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Recurrent stroke","description":"New symptomatic vascular events (ischemic or hemorrhage) .","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Recurrent ischemic stroke","description":"Recurrent symptomatic ischemic stroke events","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Any vascular complications","description":"The quantity of patients who has complications with vascular events (recurrent symptomatic ischemic stroke, myocardiac infarction, vascular death)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"EuroQol-5-Dimensions Scale（EQ-5D）questionnaire for measuring generic health status","description":"Generic health status evaluated by EQ-5D questionnaire at the end of the therapy，which consists of two components：EuroQol-5-Dimensions Scale（EQ-5D）for health state description and Visual analogue scale（VAS）for self-evaluation.
