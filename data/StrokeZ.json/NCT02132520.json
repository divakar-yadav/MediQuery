Treatments will consist of low frequency rTMS applied to the contralesional hemisphere, followed by BCI training to encourage activity within the lesioned hemisphere. The primary objective of this study is to test the main hypothesis above in a stroke patient population. Subjects will also undergo a period of BCI only treatments after completion of the combined rTMS and BCI portion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Hemiparesis","Stroke","Rehabilitation","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Repetitive","Electroencephalography","Functional Neuroimaging","Brain-Computer Interface"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects receiving standard-of-care physical therapy only."},{"label":"Sham rTMS + Real BCI Training","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will receive sham rTMS followed by real BCI training.","interventionNames":["Device: rTMS","Behavioral: BCI Training"]},{"label":"Real rTMS + Real BCI Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will receive real rTMS followed by real BCI training.","interventionNames":["Device: rTMS","Behavioral: BCI Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"rTMS","description":"Low frequency rTMS (either real or sham) will be applied to the contralesional hemisphere at a rate of 1Hz for 10 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Real rTMS + Real BCI Training","Sham rTMS + Real BCI Training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"BCI Training","description":"BCI training will consist of a series of EEG-based motor-imagery tasks with virtual feedback presented on a computer screen.","armGroupLabels":["Real rTMS + Real BCI Training","Sham rTMS + Real BCI Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in Cortical Excitability and Cortical Activation Patterns as Measured by MRI and Functional MRI","description":"The MRI and functional MRI will evaluate the extent to which cortical areas are recruited both during rest and during movement related tasks.
