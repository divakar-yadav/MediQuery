The key elements are pain control, restoration of bowel functions, good sleep quality, appetite and general well-being, as well as return to pre illness physical capabilities. Emphasis has recently been placed on finding innovative multi-disciplinary methods that can improve the care of elderly people who had suffered an acute illness. The aim of this prospective study is to assess the effect of mind-body therapy(including guided imagery, relaxation techniques, mediation and touch therapy) as as an adjunct to medical and physical rehabilitation in geriatric patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patients Who Are in Need of Short or Long Term Rehabilitation Due to Neurological Event (Mainly Stroke) or Post Orthopedic Surgery"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","mind body therapy","integrative medicine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mind body intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: mind body therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"mind body therapy","description":"mind-body therapy includes guided imagery, relaxation techniques, mediation and touch therapy.","armGroupLabels":["mind body intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"effect on quality of life","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"effect of treatment on rehabilitation","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
