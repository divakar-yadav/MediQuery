There is only one approved pharmacological treatment, Alteplase, which has to be administered within 3 hours from symptom onset. Consequently, only about 2-3% of patients world wide with ischemic strokes are treated. The naturally occurring hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), is able to protect various neuronal tissues from ischemic injury and is beneficial in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. However, treatment of stroke with EPO is undesirable due to its ability to stimulate production of red blood cells and to promote the blood to coagulate. Lu AA24493 is a modified (carbamylated) version of EPO, neuroprotective but without the haematopoietic side effects. Lu AA24493 is developed for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\nIn this safety study of single doses with Lu AA24493, patients will receive Lu AA24493 within 12-48 hours from symptom onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Erythropoietin","Carbamylated","Neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 0.005 mcg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Lu AA24493 (CEPO)"]},{"label":"Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 0.05 mcg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Lu AA24493 (CEPO)"]},{"label":"Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 0.5 mcg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Lu AA24493 (CEPO)"]},{"label":"Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 5.0 mcg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Lu AA24493 (CEPO)"]},{"label":"Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 50.0 mcg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Lu AA24493 (CEPO)"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Lu AA24493 (CEPO)","description":"0.005 - 50.0 mcg/kg body weight, IV, within 12-48 hrs from symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 0.005 mcg/kg","Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 0.05 mcg/kg","Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 0.5 mcg/kg","Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 5.0 mcg/kg","Lu AA24493 (CEPO): 50.0 mcg/kg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Vials with solution for IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Day 7, Day 30; for NIHSS also Day 2 and 3"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and mechanistic biomarkers (S-100b, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9))","timeFrame":"Baseline, Day 1-4, Day 7 and Day 30"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age between 50 and 90 years\n* Clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke\n* Measurable stroke-related deficit\n* Patient is stable\n* Treatment can be initiated between 12 hours and 48 hours after the onset of stroke\n* Expected hospital stay of at least 72 hours after study medication\n* If female then not of childbearing potential\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), or parenchymal haemorrhagic transformation of infarction (type PHI or PHII as defined in ECASS), subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), arterio-venous malformation (AVM), cerebral aneurysm, or cerebral neoplasm\n* Treated with a thrombolytic \\<24 hours (if \\>24 hours excluded ICH then eligible)\n* Score \\>0 on the NIHSS item 1a\n* Pre-stroke mRS score \\>1\n* Uncontrolled hypertension\n* Previous treatment with erythropoietin\n* Clinically significant abnormal ECG\n* Cerebral pathology\n* Received or donated blood within previous 3 months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Email contact via H.
