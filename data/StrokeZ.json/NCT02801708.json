However, routine post-stroke work up including 24-hour Holter monitoring may fail to detect paroxysmal AF. A recent systematic review has shown an increased AF detection rate with longer monitoring durations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ambulatory 7-day Holter ECG (EV-201, Parama-Tech inc.) for detecting AF in patients with recent ESUS after completion of a standard clinical examination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Embolic stroke of undetermined source","Atrial fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Detection of any atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"After examination of 7-day Holter monitoring (within 90 days of stroke onset)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of antithrombotic drugs","timeFrame":"After the examination of 7-day Holter monitoring"},{"measure":"Any ischemic or hemorrhagic event","timeFrame":"365 days after index stroke"},{"measure":"Any adverse event related to 7-day Holter monitoring","timeFrame":"After the examination of 7-day Holter monitoring"},{"measure":"Time to detection of atrial fibrillation on 7-day Holter monitoring","timeFrame":"After the examination of 7-day Holter monitoring"},{"measure":"Atrial fibrillation burden","description":"defined as the total time in atrial fibrillation devided by the total monitored time","timeFrame":"After the examination of 7-day Holter monitoring"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
