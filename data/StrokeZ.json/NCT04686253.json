In addition, the main hypothesized pathophysiologic mechanism is paradoxical embolization, namely microemboli or metabolites from the venous circulation to enter the systemic circulation. The morphological characteristics of PFO have the potential to predict risks and screen the appropriate candidates for transcatheter closure. The structure features for predicting risk included atrial septal aneurysm, a large right-left shunt, long-tunnel PFO and so on. However, the in-vivo internal microstructure of PFO is still unclear. The microstructural features might provide important information for better understanding the PFO and risk stratification.\n\nThe aim of this study is to (1) investigate the internal microstructure of patent foramen ovale related to cryptogenic stroke, transient ischemic attack or migraine and determine the effectiveness of transcatheter closure in these patients; (2) evaluate the microstructural features of asymptomatic patients with PFO and make a follow-up；(3) perform an untargeted metabolomics analysis using plasma samples from right atrium and left atrium and shunt provocative test was conducted.\n\nThis study will enroll subjects with PFO, and enrollment will be divided into three phases.\n\nPhase 1: PFO patients with CS or/and TIA (transcatheter closure of PFO was performed). A minimum of 100 patients is reached.\n\nPhase 2: PFO patients with migraine (transcatheter closure of PFO was performed). A minimum of 100 patients is reached.\n\nPhase 3: PFO patients without symptom (5-year follow-up). A minimum of 100 patients is reached.\n\nIn addition, blood samples were obtained, including inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, right atrium, left pulmonary artery, left atrium and left pulmonary vein. Then, another 20 ml blood sample was obtained from right atrium (near PFO) and injected into left atrium immediately. During a ten-minute waiting period, any symptom was recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patent Foramen Ovale"],"keywords":["patent foramen ovale","stroke","transient ischemic attack","migraine","microstructure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PFO patients with CS or/and TIA","description":"PFO patients with CS or/and TIA (transcatheter closure of PFO was performed).","interventionNames":["Other: not appliable"]},{"label":"PFO patients with migraine","description":"PFO patients with migraine (transcatheter closure of PFO was performed).","interventionNames":["Other: not appliable"]},{"label":"PFO patients without symptom","description":"PFO patients without symptom (5-year follow-up).","interventionNames":["Other: not appliable"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"not appliable","description":"not appliable","armGroupLabels":["PFO patients with CS or/and TIA","PFO patients with migraine","PFO patients without symptom"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse Events after evaluation of PFO internal microstructure","description":"cryptogenic stroke, transient ischemic attack , migraine or systemic embolism","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
