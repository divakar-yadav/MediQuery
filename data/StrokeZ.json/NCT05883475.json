HSP is a problem that, starting from mild discomfort, leads to gradual functional impairment, ultimately resulting in increasing disability and decreased independence.In the literature, the relationship between HSP and upper extremity function, functional independence, and sleep quality has not been clarified."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Shoulder Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":63,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with shoulder pain","description":"Those who scored above \"0\" for shoulder pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were assigned to the group with shoulder pain","interventionNames":["Other: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire","Other: Arm Motor Ability Test","Other: Nine Hole Peg Test","Other: Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index","Other: Functional Independence Measure"]},{"label":"Patients without shoulder pain","description":"Those who scored \"0\" for shoulder pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were assigned to the group without shoulder pain","interventionNames":["Other: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire","Other: Arm Motor Ability Test","Other: Nine Hole Peg Test","Other: Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index","Other: Functional Independence Measure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire","description":"Upper limb function was assessed with the Turkish version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (DASH).
