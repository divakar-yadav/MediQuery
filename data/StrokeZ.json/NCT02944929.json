Most patients have activity limitations because of the resulting motor deficit and spasticity. Autonomy in activities of daily living is reduced.\n\nThe principal treatment for focal spasticity is currently intramuscular botulinum toxin injection (BTI).\n\nBTI is classically combined with only 2 to 3 sessions of out-patient physiotherapy per week. This is mainly because of a lack of out-patient therapists. However, this amount of therapy is insufficient and does not follow current literature which shows that the intensity of physiotherapy affects the recovery of impairment and activity. This gap in our health system could be filled by a self-rehabilitation program in addition to physiotherapy.\n\nRecent studies have shown that self-rehabilitation following BTI could significantly improve activity limitation (Roche et al, 2014 ; Sun et al 2010).\n\nThe addition of a self-rehabilitation program to BTI and usual out-patient physiotherapy could thus increase the effects of BTI on impairment and activity limitation in patients with spastic hemiparesis following stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spastic Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Spastic hemiparesis","Stroke","Self-rehabilitation","Botulinum Toxin Injections"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Self-rehabilitation program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Self-rehabilitation program + standard medical care (BTI + conventional physiotherapy)","interventionNames":["Other: Self-rehabilitation program"]},{"label":"Control arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Arm with standard medical care ( BTI + conventional physiotherapy) without self-rehabilitation program"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Self-rehabilitation program","description":"The self-rehabilitation program will be based on muscle stretching, strengthening and task oriented exercises.
