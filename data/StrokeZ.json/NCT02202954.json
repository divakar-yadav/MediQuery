For patients with sufficient cognitive abilities, Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts allow implementing stretch and training at high intensity and may result in meaningful functional improvement in chronic stages, as long as discipline persists over at least a year span.\n\nThis single blind control protocol will evaluate Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts as against conventional therapy in the community, for a one year duration in persons with chronic hemiparesis after stroke.","detailedDescription":"This single blind controlled multicentre protocol will compare the evolution after a one-year treatment, either using a Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract or conventional therapy in the community. Patients with chronic stroke-induced hemiparesis (over a year post stroke) will be selected to be randomized between the two groups, Conventional or in Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts.\n\nIn Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts, the therapist acts as a coach, in the sports' sense, providing double guidance:\n\n* Technical, selecting and teaching the required exercises to the patient using infrequent thorough visits, for example every month.\n* Psychological, binding with the patient on the contract.\n\nThe patient agrees to:\n\n* Perform the prescribed daily stretch postures and rapid alternating movements over the long term.\n* Document this work in a written diary.\n\nTo facilitate such contracts, a manual for guided self-rehabilitation in spastic paresis has been developed and will be provided to patients randomized to that group.\n\n124 patients will be enrolled from 6 centers in France: Creteil, Paris Fernand-Widal, Toulouse, Reims, Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux. The duration of patient participation will be 2 years: 6 months follow-up, 1 year intervention and another 6-month follow-up after the study intervention. Only functional assessments will be used, using in particular ambulation speed for the lower limb and the Modified FRENCHAY Scale for the upper limb."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Muscle Spasticity","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":124,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts, the therapist acts as a coach, in the sports' sense, providing double guidance: technical, selecting and teaching the required exercises to the patient using infrequent thorough visits, for example every month; Psychological, binding with the patient on the contract.\n\nThe patient agrees to perform the prescribed daily stretch postures and rapid alternating movements over the long term and to document this work in a written diary.","interventionNames":["Other: Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract"]},{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"conventional therapy in the community"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract","description":"In Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts, the therapist acts as a coach, in the sports' sense, providing double guidance: technical, selecting and teaching the required exercises to the patient using infrequent thorough visits, for example every month; Psychological, binding with the patient on the contract.\n\nThe patient agrees to perform the prescribed daily stretch postures and rapid alternating movements over the long term and to document this work in a written diary.","armGroupLabels":["Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional motor recovery assessed by a composite endpoint (one for upper limbs and one for lower limbs)","description":"1.
