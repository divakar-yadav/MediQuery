Patients with acute ischaemic stroke between 7-30 days after onset with moderae severity in sable condition will be entered into the study after informed consent. Both arms will receive standard treatment but BMMC arm will,in addition,have bone marrow aspiration and receive autologous 30-500 million bone marrow mononuclear cells intravenously on the day of randomisation and all patients will be followed at DaY 7 Â± days, Day 90(-7 days to +14 days), Day 180(-7 days to +28 days)and Day 365 (-7 days to + 28 days). A number of safety and efficacy variables will be measured. This phase 2 study will aim to determine dose response gradient of stem cell therapy and to explore if results have a favourable risk to benefit ratio to justify a phase 3 study. This will be the first human trial to determine and compare favourable and unfavourable effects of bone marrow mononuclear cells(mainly CD34) in acute ischamic stroke and also the first multi-centric study with potential to achieve a reasonable sample size in a relatively short time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Autologous bone marrow stem cell","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Biological: Autologous bone marrow stem cell"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Autologous bone marrow stem cell","description":"Autologous bone marrow stem cell have bone marrow aspiration and receive 30-500 million bone marrow mononuclear cells intravenously on the day of randomization.","armGroupLabels":["Autologous bone marrow stem cell"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel index score","description":"The primary efficacy outcome is difference between the two groups in the modified Barthel index score at six month post randomization.","timeFrame":"six month post randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS score and functional status","description":"1.
