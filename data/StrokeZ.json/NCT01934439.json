We hypothesize that the combination of assisted movement, torque biofeedback, and muscle vibration will reduce impairment (i.e., increase strength and range-of-motion; decrease inappropriate patterns of muscle contraction) and, thereby, lead to more accurate reaching with the proximal arm."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Dyssynergia","Robotics","AMES","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PAAD (Proximal Arm AMES Device)Treatments","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The PAAD flexes and extends the elbow, and it abducts and adducts the shoulder, where \"abduction\" is away from the side of the body, and \"adduction\" is towards it. Elbow extension occurs simultaneously with shoulder abduction, and elbow flexion occurs simultaneously with shoulder adduction. At the same time as the movements, vibrators are utilized to activate muscle spindle Ia receptors in the muscles of the arm to exaggerate the perception of movement.","interventionNames":["Device: 30 PAAD treatments"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"30 PAAD treatments","description":"Subjects will don a shirt with pockets at the elbow and shoulder in each of which a muscle vibrator is located. The subject will then place the affected arm in the PAAD. The PAAD will range the affected arm, at the shoulder in the adduction-abduction direction, and at the elbow in the flexion-extension direction. The subject will assist volitionally this motion, and visual feedback of the level of their assistive torque will be provided along with a target torque level. The muscle vibrators will alternate from one side of each of the 2 joints to the other as the motion reverses, vibration always being applied to the lengthening muscles. This treatment will last 30 min in each session.","armGroupLabels":["PAAD (Proximal Arm AMES Device)Treatments"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Upper Extremity","timeFrame":"Baseline and change from baseline at 0 and 3 months post completion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ashworth Spasticity Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline and change from baseline at 0 and 3 months post completion"},{"measure":"Modified Wolf Motor Test","timeFrame":"Baseline and change from baseline at 0 and 3 months post completion"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Box and Block Test","timeFrame":"Baseline and change from baseline at 0 and 3 months post completion"},{"measure":"Upper extremity strength of the shoulder and elbow joints","description":"The PAAD measures the strength at the elbow and shoulder by recording the torque applied by the subject to the device with the elbow and shoulder during maximal efforts.","timeFrame":"Baseline, after each of 30 treatments, 3 months post completion of all treatments"},{"measure":"Reaching Test","description":"In the Reaching Test, a video system will test each participant's pointing accuracy and smoothness of transportation of the arm to reach specific targets.","timeFrame":"Baseline and change from baseline at 0 and 3 months post completion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic or Hemorrhagic stroke affecting the right arm\n* One year or longer since stroke\n* Severe impairment of right arm with a baseline upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score between 8-24\n* Right elbow and shoulder spasticity (Ashworth score â‰¤3)\n* Right shoulder abduction-elbow flexion dyssynergia\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Exercise intolerance\n* Co-morbidities limiting arm movement (e.g. shoulder subluxation)\n* Chronic pain\n* Cognitive dysfunction preventing compliance with instructions\n* Participation in other ongoing research studies\n* Plans to initiate or discontinue any physical/occupational therapy during the period of enrollment","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Barry Oken, MD","affiliation":"Oregon Health and Science University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Paul J Cordo, Ph.D","affiliation":"Oregon Health and Science University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Oregon Health and Science University West Campus","city":"Beaverton","state":"Oregon","zip":"97006","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":45.48706,"lon":-122.80371}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18645190","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Cordo P, Lutsep H, Cordo L, Wright WG, Cacciatore T, Skoss R.
