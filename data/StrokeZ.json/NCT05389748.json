The investigators hypothesize that early administration of NanO2 in subjects with LVO ischemic stroke will maintain the viability of tissue in the penumbra until revascularization is achieved with intravenous alteplase and/or mechanical thrombectomy (MT).\n\nThe rationale for administering the dose evaluated is:\n\n1. The dose level is within the levels already tested in animals and humans.5-13 Volunteers received two IV bolus doses of 0.35 mL/kg of activated NanO2TM 24 hours apart and brain cancer subjects received daily doses of up to 0.17 mL/kg of inactivated NanO2TM.18\n2. A completed trial of NanO2TM in acute ischemic stroke at the University of Arkansas had the high dose cohort receive three doses of NanO2 (0.17 mL/kg) 90 minutes apart and demonstrated safety at this dose.\n3. Therapeutic reduction in stroke damage has been observed at dose levels of 0.1 mL/kg in rabbits.5-9,12 Since drug effects tend to correlate with body surface area/weight, one would predict that a dose of approximately 0.03 mL/kg should be effective in humans compared to rabbits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["perfusion","penumbra","mechanical thrombectomy","large vessel occlusion stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo which appears the same as the treatment to investigators, clinicians and subjects.","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"NanO2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A milky white intravenous injectable emulsion","interventionNames":["Biological: dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Subjects with large vessel occlusion stroke eligible for mechanical thrombectomy are randomized to placebo in association with standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe)","description":"Subjects with large vessel occlusion stroke eligible for mechanical thrombectomy are randomized to DDFPe in association with standard of care","armGroupLabels":["NanO2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Modified Rankin Scale","description":"Both are established and accepted measures of stroke.
