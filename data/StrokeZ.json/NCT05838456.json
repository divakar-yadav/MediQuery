A key delay occurs in the time between completion of computed tomography (CT) angiography of the head and neck and interpretation in the setting of AIS care.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the effect of incorporating Viz.AI software, which via via a machine-learning algorithm performs artificial intelligence-based automated detection of large vessel occlusions (LVO) on CT angiography (CTA) images and alerts the AIS care team (diagnosis and treatment decisions will be based on the clinical evaluation and review of the images by the treating physician, per routine standard of care). The hypothesis is that integration of the software into the AIS care pathway will reduce delays in treatment.
