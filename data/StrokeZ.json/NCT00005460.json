At the time of the analysis, mortality follow-up was complete for over 99 percent of subjects, and incident morbidity information was available for myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and stroke. The database included measurements which allowed: 1) prospective analyses of the effects of putative cardiovascular risk factors on disease incidence in the elderly, 2) prospective analyses of the impact of change in risk factors on events in the elderly, 3) exploration of risk factors not classically associated with cardiovascular events in younger populations but which may be important in the very old, and, 4) cross-sectional description of putative risk factors in an aged population.\n\nThe study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Myocardial Infarction","Cerebrovascular Accident","Coronary Disease","Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL"},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"No eligibility criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"8406660","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Langer RD, Criqui MH, Barrett-Connor EL, Klauber MR, Ganiats TG.
