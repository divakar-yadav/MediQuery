The device evaluate gait parameters in real time thanks to an embedded algorithm based on the processing of inertial measurement unit and 19 sensors signals.\n\nAt D0 and D7, the patient is evaluated by both the GaitRite® system and the FeetMe Monitor® system simultaneously. Hemiparetic patients have two measurements 7 days apart. The patient repeats 5 trials at a comfortable speed on the GaitRite® mat while wearing the FeetMe® insoles. Each measurement is repeated by 4 different operators. A total of 20 trials are made by the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait Disorders, Neurologic"],"keywords":["Gait analysis","Stroke","FeetMe","GaitRite"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hemiparetic patient","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients who had a stroke at least 6 months before inclusion","interventionNames":["Device: FeetMe Monitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"FeetMe Monitor","description":"For gait parameters' evaluation, the investigator asks the participant to move in a straight line over a 10-meter mat.
