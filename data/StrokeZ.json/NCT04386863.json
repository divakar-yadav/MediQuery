Few researches investigated the contribution of the components of a neurorehabilitation program to the clinical outcome in everyday clinical practice. Moreover, there is no a standard method to categorize rehabilitative interventions, making difficult to explain why subjects improve and which of the various treatments is more effective. Thus, it was decided to build a multicentre network to collect data using a taxonomy tool developed to provide information on the goals of rehabilitation and to categorize rehabilitation interventions"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Parkinson Disease"],"keywords":["Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Parkinson","Taxonomy","Rehabilitation","Outcome measures"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":204,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Two minute walking test","description":"The Two minute walking test is a test used to evaluate functional exercise capacity. Subjects are instructed to walk as fast as possible in 2 minutes, along a 30-m hallway. Total distance walked is recorded","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Box and Blocks test","description":"The Box and Block Test measures unilateral gross manual dexterity. The test consists of a box with a partition in the middle and is scored by counting the number of blocks carried over the partition from one compartment to the other during the one-minute trial.","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Reaching Performance Scale","description":"The Reaching Performance Scale is a visual scale used in clinics to provide assessment of motor capabilities during reaching movements. It was designed to investigate reaching movements at low height in the workspace of the limb, at increasing distance. Higher scores indicate better performances.","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale","description":"The Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale asks individuals to self-report their balance confidence in successfully performing 16 specific movement activities of varied balance difficulty. Higher scores indicate better balance confidence.","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Cognitive dual-task Timed-Up-and-Go test","description":"Patients will be first asked to stand from a seated position, walk 3 m at their usual pace, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down (the Timed Up and Go test). Walking aids were allowed. After a recovery phase, patients will be asked to perform the same exercise while performing a cognitive dual task (continuously subtracting 2, starting from 100; the Cognitive dual-task Timed Up and Go test). Lower times indicate better performances.","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Manual Ability Measurement","description":"The Manual Ability Measurement is a questionnaire on perceived ease or difficulty that a persons may experience when performing unilateral and bilateral ADL tasks. Higher scores indicate less difficulty in ADL tasks.","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in modified Dynamic Gait Index","description":"The modified Dynamic Gait Index is a clinical outcome measure to assess the ability to modify and adapt gait and balance during complex walking tasks. Higher scores indicate better performances.","timeFrame":"Baseline and after a minimum of 2 weeks up to a maximum of 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index","description":"Measure of physical disability used widely to assess behaviour relating to activities of daily living for patients with disabling conditions. It measures what patients do in practice.
