Non-invasive brain stimulation can induce significant and sustained improvements in functional outcome. However the effect is inconsistent and difficult to predict, in particular in the subacute phase after stroke. Although several different stimulation techniques are available, it is unknown which is suitable for which patient.\n\nObjectives: This study has three main objectives:\n\n1. To compare the effects of two techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (cTBC, continuous theta-burst stimulation; tDCS, direct current transcranial stimulation) on clinical recovery in patients with subacute stroke.\n2. To assess the effect of these brain stimulation techniques on brain organization with non-invasive imaging.\n3. To find clinical and neural predictors of responsiveness to brain stimulation therapy.\n\nMethod: 45 patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: cTBS, tDCS, or sham stimulation. Each group will receive the corresponding stimulation therapy 3 times per week for 3 weeks, immediately before intensive physical therapy. Before and after the treatment period, standardized assessments of sensorimotor function areas are obtained together with electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance recordings. These recordings will be used to analyze and compare the neural effects of each treatment modality.\n\nClinical Implication: The results of this study might help optimize and individualize stimulation treatment for patients with subacute stroke. It may hence facilitate the transfer of brain stimulation therapy to routine clinical practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","brain stimulation","electroencephalography","functional magnetic resonance imaging","functional connectivity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cTBS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A transcranial magnetic stimulator (MagPro X100, Medtronic Functional Diagnostics, Skovlunde, Denmark) will deliver continuous bursts of bipolar magnetic pulses exerting an inhibition on the underlying brain tissue (cTBS).
