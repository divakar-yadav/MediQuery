Half of the participants will receive 60 hours of intensive treatment over three weeks, while the other half will receive the same amount and type of comprehensive treatment distributed over 15 weeks.","detailedDescription":"Recent research has emphasized the need for intensive aphasia treatment in order to make the long-term neuroplastic changes associated with recovery and rehabilitation following a stroke. Furthermore, studies have indicated that intensive aphasia treatment is more efficacious than less intensive treatment. Rather than being influenced by such evidence, the reality is that public and private payers are drastically reducing services to persons with aphasia (PWA). Legislation has seriously curtailed the amount of treatment a PWA may receive after hospitalization. Often patients are eligible for only a limited number of treatment sessions over a limited period of time. In some cases, they may not receive any treatment for their communication disorder following their acute hospitalization. Reduced resources (e.g. transportation difficulties, therapist shortages in rural areas) also may severely limit available services.\n\nThe Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program (ICAP) may be a creative, cost-effective and sustainable option for delivering meaningful and necessary aphasia services. Despite the growing numbers of ICAPs, there is little evidence about their efficacy, effectiveness, or cost-effectiveness. All stakeholders need this evidence. Funding agencies require evidence to make decisions about their investments in aphasia rehabilitation. People with aphasia and their families should have evidence prior to investing their money and time into such programs, and speech and language pathologists have an ethical obligation to provide evidence-based practices.\n\nBased on evidence regarding treatment intensity that has translated principles of neuroplasticity from animal models to stroke recovery, the investigators hypothesize that 60 hours of comprehensive treatment will result in significant improvements in (a) performance-based, (b) client-reported, and (c) surrogate-reported assessments of communication skills, community participation, and health-related quality of life. They also hypothesize that when 60 hours of comprehensive treatment is provided intensively over 3 weeks, the magnitude and rate of improvement as well as the extent to which improvements are maintained will be greater than when the 60 hours of comprehensive treatment is distributed over 15 weeks. Because the investigators hypothesize that the magnitude and rate of improvement will be greater with the intensive ICAP than with the distributed ICAP, they further hypothesize that the intensive ICAP will be more cost-effective than the distributed ICAP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Speech and Language Treatment","ICAP","Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Both treatment arms will provide 60 hours of comprehensive aphasia therapy. In the ICAP arm, the 60 hours of treatment will be applied intensively, 4 hours per day, 5 days a week for three weeks. In the Distributed Treatment arm, the 60 hours of comprehensive treatment will be distributed over 15 weeks (i.e. two 2-hour visits per week).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Because of the nature of the intervention, neither the treating SLPs nor the subjects can be masked regarding the scheduling of treatment. To minimize outcome ascertainment bias, an evaluator (testing speech-language pathologist) who is not directly associated with the daily activities of the trial and, therefore, blind to the treatment arm will administer and score all the assessments. Subjects will be introduced to the treatment arm to which they have been assigned with a script that emphasizes similar expectations from the intervention, regardless of the treatment group. This will reduce subject bias resulting from such beliefs that one of the therapies is less effective.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"60 hours of comprehensive speech and language therapy applied intensively, 4 hours per day, 5 days a week for three weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speech and Language Therapy"]},{"label":"Distributed Comprehensive Aphasia Tx","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"60 hours of comprehensive speech and language therapy distributed over 15 weeks (i.e. two 2-hour visits per week).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Speech and Language Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Speech and Language Therapy","description":"Includes:\n\n* one hour of individual therapy using a multimodality treatment called Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) that simultaneously targets semantics (word retrieval) and syntax (sentence construction);\n* one hour of constraint induced language therapy (CILT) where participants are paired and practice requesting and providing specific information using only spoken language;\n* one hour in the computer lab working on programs called Oral Reading for Language in Aphasia (ORLA) and AphasiaScripts; and\n* one hour in a conversation group that emphasizes multimodality communication","armGroupLabels":["Distributed Comprehensive Aphasia Tx","Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Language Quotient of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R LQ)","description":"Includes a measure of auditory comprehension, oral expression, reading and written expression skills.
