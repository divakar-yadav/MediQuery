Arm motor skill can recover if the rehabilitation program provides an adequate \"dose\" of repetitive movement practice. However, the vast majority of stroke survivors lack the proper practice-dose because the duration of inpatient stroke rehabilitation is limited by cost, or residence in medically underserved rural settings. To meet the pressing need for innovative cost-effective rehabilitation options, the investigators developed, tested and licensed a prototype virtual environment (VE) for post-stroke arm rehabilitation. Its custom built design motivates extended practice of specific arm motor skills known to improve quality of life. Excitingly, practice sessions do not require direct therapist supervision. Published pilot data demonstrated improved real-world arm movement after VE training. These promising initial results led to software upgrades that will now enable installation and testing in the primary markets for this technology; stroke rehabilitation hospitals, and patients' homes. The overall goal for this small pilot study is to test the feasibility of self-directed VE practice in these settings measured by movement repetitions and motor skill improvement. To that end, this project will address the following Specific Aims (1) Determine the number of daily movement repetitions and treatment effect achieved by inpatients in a stroke rehabilitation hospital who self-direct VE practice sessions during non-therapy hours (evenings, weekends) compared to standard evening activities; and (2) Determine the number of daily movement repetitions and treatment effect achieved by in-home stroke survivors who self-direct daily VE practice sessions compared to a group of in-home survivors with a standard self-directed exercise program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Duck Duck Punch","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Community dwelling stroke survivors: Stroke survivors will install an interactive computer game in their home.

Subjects will be shown how to don/doff wristwatch sized triaxial Actigraph accelerometers (GT3X+ Activity Monitor; ActiGraph LLC) by securing a Velcro band on the dorsal aspect of each wrist proximal to the wrist joint. Subjects will be instructed to don the accelerometers each time they engaged in either the computer game or standard activity and wear them only for the duration of the activity. The accelerometers will be stored in a box during other times. Accelerometry data will be recorded in 1 minute epochs as the number of arm activity counts. At the final study evaluation session, data will be used to create a ratio of paretic to non-paretic arm activity counts. A value of 1 will indicate bilateral arm use, a value higher than 1 will indicate that the paretic arm was used more than the non-paretic arm, and a value less than 1 will indicate that the paretic arm was used less than the non-paretic arm.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment","description":"a 33-item measure of arm impairment testing the subject's ability to achieve various postures with the paretic arm and hand, scored on a 3 point ordinal rating scale with higher scores indicating less motor impairment.","timeFrame":"up to 7 days"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"A 15-item evaluation of paretic arm motor function, testing the amount of time required for a subject to use the paretic arm to accomplish various functional tasks.","timeFrame":"up to 7 days"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale - Hand subtest","description":"A 5-item evaluation of patient self-reported level of difficulty using the paretic hand to perform various functional activities at home.
