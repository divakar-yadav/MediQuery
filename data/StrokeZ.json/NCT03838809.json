Although its use is widespread in sports science and sports performance, its use for the rehabilitation of patients with neurological pathologies is less studied.\n\nObjective: The purpose of this research was to determine the changes that occur in the application of BIO-SEMG in the muscles responsible for the extension and the dorsiflexion of the hand and the foot in subjects with cerebrovascular damage.\n\nDesign: A randomized, double-blind, two-arm parallel group study was performed.\n\nPatients: A sample of 28 subjects with limited extension of the hand and dorsiflexion of the foot as a consequence of a stroke was randomized divided in intervention or control groups.\n\nMethods: The subjects of the intervention group underwent 12 sessions of BIO-SEMG, of 15-minute duration each of them, in the upper and lower members. On the other hand, the control group underwent another 12 sessions of 15-minute duration, in which manual physiotherapy techniques were performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"INTERVENTION","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A group that underwent a neurological physiotherapy program with electromyography-biofeedback on the hand and the foot","interventionNames":["Device: surface electromyography-biofeedback"]},{"label":"CONTROL","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A group that underwent a conventional physiotheraphy intervention","interventionNames":["Device: surface electromyography-biofeedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"surface electromyography-biofeedback","description":"Two electrodes were putted on the motor point of the extensor muscle of the hand and the foot.
