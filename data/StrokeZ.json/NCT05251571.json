In this way, it will be ensured that individuals can perform their exercises at the optimum level in non-clinical environments. The aim of the study is to compare the conventional home exercise program performed with video-based telerehabilitation and the balance coordination program in subacute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Telerehabilitation","Balance","Coordination"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised Controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Exercise Group with Telerehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Exercises such as muscle strengthening exercises applied to antigravity muscles, agonist antagonist spastic muscles, stretching exercises for spastic muscles, weight transfer will be applied, and a telerehabilitation platform will be used in the home exercise program.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Exercise Group with Telerehabilitation"]},{"label":"Balance Coordination Group with Telerehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sit and stand exercise from chair, standing posture, weight transfer to right and left extremities, stepping over obstacles, standing on one leg with support from the table, standing on two legs with support from the table, hip abduction with support from the table, extension, flexion, supported tandem walking exercises such as stepping on the stairs, standing functional stretches will be applied.
