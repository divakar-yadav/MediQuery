This study aimed to evaluating the effect of robotic gait therapy for motor recovery after stroke.","detailedDescription":"This study designed an assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical study. The participations followed the study protocol and were randomly divided into the control group and Walkbot group. The control group received conventional functional rehabilitation for 40 min/session, 2 sessions/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, 40 sessions in all. Whereas the Walkbot group received conventional physical therapy (session I for 40 min/day) companied with Walkbot training (session II for 30 min/day) 5 days a week for 4 weeks, 40 session in all. After 4-week intervention all subjects received conventional physical therapy only, 40 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. During the test period, general rehabilitation and drug treatment can be done at the same time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","robot-assisted therapy","conventional therapy","motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Walkbot group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Walkbot group received conventional physical therapy (session I for 40 min/day) companied with Walkbot training (session II for 30 min/day) 5 days a week for 4 weeks, 40 session in all.
