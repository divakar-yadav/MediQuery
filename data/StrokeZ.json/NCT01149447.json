After the PFO closure procedure a dual antiplatelet regimen is often prescribed for 3-6 months and several cardiologic and neurologic follow-up exams are scheduled in the first 12 months of follow-up. Usually a transthoracic +/- transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE +/- TEE) are performed at 6 months, however this kind of control is not systematically performed. In order to improve the clinical outcomes in this young patients' population, the investigators prospectively perform a complete cardiologic and neurologic follow-up program to all patients undergoing a successful percutaneous closure of a PFO.\n\nThe aim of these controls is to confirm the good position of the PFO-device, to confirm the absence of any residual right to left shunt or any significant atrial arrhythmias Furthermore this prospective follow-up will analyze the possible mechanisms leading to a cerebral stroke recurrence (e.g. size of the PFO, presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, presence of a residual shunt, size of the utilized closure device, ....).","detailedDescription":"At follow-up the following exams will be performed:\n\n* at hospital discharge: chest X-ray +/- TTE + 7-days event loop record (ELR)\n* at 6 months: clinical cardiologic and neurologic examination + TTE + TEE + 7-days ELR + trans-cranial doppler (TCD) with micro bubbles detection.\n* at 1 year: clinical cardiologic and neurologic examination + TTE +/- TEE + 7-days ELR + trans-cranial doppler (TCD) with micro bubbles detection +/- cerebral
