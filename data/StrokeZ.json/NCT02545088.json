In addition, each session will include conventional gait training that will not exceed 30 min effective training time. To standardize the training procedure, training with HAL is performed on a treadmill and to enable body weight support. Body weight support is used to prevent falls and to unburden the weight of the suit (9 kg). The training program is performed by physiotherapists, trained in the HAL method and the study procedures. At the end of the 6 weeks, the physiotherapist that has been engaged in the patient's conventional training will perform 1-2 home visits to inform/educate the patient and those who are providing assistance to the patient in how the patient can make use of any gains in gait function during activities of daily living.\n\nThe 1st control group will receive conventional gait training performed 1 session/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks that will not exceed 1h 30 min effective training time.\n\nThe 2nd control group will not receive an intervention. The conventional gait training is performed according to current best evidence based practice and may include over ground walking with assistance and/or assistant devices as well as the use of a treadmill and body weight support and training of gait function in activities of daily living"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ambulation Difficulty","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)"]},{"label":"1st control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: 1st control group"]},{"label":"2nd control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: 2nd control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)","description":"Intensive gait training with Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is performed 1 session/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks and each session will not exceed 60 min of effective walking time with HAL.
