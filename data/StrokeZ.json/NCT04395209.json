The present study aims to determine MS loss in stroke individuals (SI). 33 SI and 33 healthy individuals (HI) were included in this study. MS and handgrip force were assessed using a power track dynamometer and Jamar hand dynamometer, respectively. The total MS of the HI was calculated by summing the muscle strength of the trunk, lower and upper extremities. In the SI, the muscle strength of the trunk, unaffected upper and lower extremities were summed to calculate the total MS. To compare MS of unaffected sides (US) between groups, 27 SI who was dominant and not affected on the right side and 33 HI who was dominant on the right side were used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"individuals with stroke and healthy subject","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke individuals","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: assesment"]},{"label":"healthy individuals","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: assesment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"assesment","description":"muscle strength assessment in stroke individuals","armGroupLabels":["healthy individuals","stroke individuals"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Muscle Strength Loss In Stroke Individuals - Control Study","description":"muscle strength of stroke individuals was assesed by power track hand held dynamometer and The Jamar Hand dynamometer, And recorded in newton.","timeFrame":"24 week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* for patient with stroke\n* Between 30-65 ages\n* Diagnosed with stroke chronic stroke patients (diagnosed with a stroke at least 6 months ago)\n\nfor healthy individuals\n\n* 30-65 ages\n* healthy individuals\n\nExclusion Criteria for patient with stroke\n\n* patient with an additional neurological disease to stroke\n* patients with orthopedic problems,\n* patients with mental and communication impairments\n* patients who scored more than 3 points for the Modified Rankin Scale for healthy individuals;\n* who had active sporting life","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University Address","city":"Denizli","state":"Pamukkale","zip":"20100","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":37.77417,"lon":29.0875}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
