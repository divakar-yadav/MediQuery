For these patients current North American and European guidelines recommend a triple therapy strategy, including vitamin K antagonists (VKA), aspirin and clopidogrel. A major drawback of this triple therapy strategy is a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, the ommitance of aspirin and the introduction of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors as well as the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC), created numerous new antithrombotic treatment strategies for these patients with overlapping conditions. To date, evidence on the risks and benefits of these new antithrombotic treatment strategies is lacking.\n\nThe WOEST 2 Registry aims to improve medical care for patients with AF and/or a heart valve prosthesis ánd undergoing coronary revascularisation through a better understanding of their demographics, antithrombotic management and related in-hospital and long-term outcomes. The WOEST 2 Registry will provide data to support benchmarking of antithrombotic treatment patterns and patient outcomes.\n\nObjective: To assess the different management patterns and related in-hospital and long-term safety and efficacy outcomes of combined use of chronic oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12 inhibitor in patients with atrial fibrillation and/or a heart valve prosthesis undergoing coronary revascularisation.","detailedDescription":"The WOEST 2 Registry is a prospective, international, multi-centre, non-interventional, cohort study designed to recruit an unselected cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation and/or a heart valve prosthesis undergoing coronary revascularisation.\n\nTrial overview\n\nName : WOEST 2 REGISTRY\n\nTarget for enrollment : 2200 patients\n\nTime frame for inclusion : within 72 hours after index PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\n\nFollow-up : 24 months\n\nVisits : 30 days, 12 and 24 months after index PCI or CABG"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillations","Heart Valve Prostheses","Acute Coronary Syndromes","Coronary Artery Diseases","Stroke","Bleeding","Myocardial Infarction"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillations","Heart Valve Prostheses","Acute Coronary Syndromes","Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization","Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting","Coronary Artery Diseases","Myocardial Infarction","Ischemic stroke","Bleeding","Thrombosis","Myocardial Ischemia","Heart Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases","Embolism and Thrombosis","Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors","Aspirin","Clopidogrel","Ticagrelor","Prasugrel","Antithrombotic treatment","Oral anticoagulation","Warfarin","Dabigatran etexilate mesylate","Apixaban","Rivaroxaban","Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors","Direct Thrombin Inhibitors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"24 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with chronic oral anticoagulation and P2Y12 inhibitor","description":"Patients with chronic indication for chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) because of a heart valve prosthesis and/or atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary revascularisation (by PCI or CABG) and requiring concomitant treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors.","interventionNames":["Drug: Combination of chronic oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12 inhibitor with or without aspirin."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Combination of chronic oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12 inhibitor with or without aspirin.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with chronic oral anticoagulation and P2Y12 inhibitor"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite of the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack), non-central nervous system systemic embolization and cardiovascular death [the primary efficacy outcome].","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"The occurrence of any bleeding episode requiring in-hospital medical attention and/or a switch of antithrombotic medication [the primary safety outcome].","description":"Bleeding will be classified by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2, 3, 4 and 5 bleeding criteria and by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) minor and major bleeding criteria.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nIn order to be eligible to be included in this registry, a subject must meet ALL of the following criteria:\n\n1.
