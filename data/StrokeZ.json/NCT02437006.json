In the first stage, 30 subjects with stroke (onset \\> 2 weeks) are recruited, and they are assessed and recorded with sympathetic nerve testing, anthropometry, and twice symptom-limit exercise capacity tests.The second stage would recruited 90 subjects with stroke (onset\\>2 weeks), and they are randomized to one of three groups. The control group undergoes traditional rehabilitation only, The low-intensity exercise group receives a low-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation. The The high-intensity exercise group gets a high-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation. They are evaluated by sympathetic tests, anthropometry, functional scales and activity questionnaires, and symptom-limit exercise capacity tests before and after the four-week training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","exercise capacity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rehabilitation","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"half an hour physical and half an hour occupational therapy in rehabilitation"},{"label":"Low-intensity exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Low-intensity exercise plus rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: exercise"]},{"label":"High-intensity exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-intensity exercise plus rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"exercise","description":"cycle ergometry","armGroupLabels":["High-intensity exercise","Low-intensity exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change values of symptom-limit exercise capacity","description":"value was showed by oxygen uptake (mL/kg/min)","timeFrame":"baseline and after four-week training"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change values of sympathetic nerve tests","description":"change value was measure by blood pressure (from lying to stand, mm-Hg) at baseline and after four weeks","timeFrame":"baseline and after four-week training"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke onset longer than two weeks,\n* eligible for exercise testing by Doctor\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* aphasia,\n* apraxia","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Miao-Ju Hsu, PHD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"88673121101","phoneExt":"2673","email":"mjhsu@kmu.edu.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Miao-Ju Hsu, PHD","affiliation":"Kaohsiung Medical University, College of Health Sciences","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kaohsiung Medical University, College of Health Sciences","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Kaohsiung","zip":"807","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Miao-Ju Hsu, PHD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-7-3121101","phoneExt":"2673","email":"mjhsu@kmu.edu.tw"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":22.61626,"lon":120.31333}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
