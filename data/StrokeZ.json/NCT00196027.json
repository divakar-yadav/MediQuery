An association between patent foramen ovale and severe migraine headaches has also been reported. Several implantable devices are being used for percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale; we propose to use a non-implantable system to safely effect closure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patent Foramen Ovale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"PFX Closure System"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PFO closure as measured by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or transcranial Doppler (TCD) acutely post procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PFO closure as measured by TEE or TCD at 30 days post procedure"},{"measure":"Neurological death and adverse event (AE) rates for all subjects through 30 day follow-up"},{"measure":"New arrhythmia rate through 30 day follow-up.

A coexisting redundant atrial septal aneurysm is considered large if it prohibits the ability of the operator to adequately achieve vacuum suction necessary to achieve PFO closure.\n* Presence of arrhythmia requiring pharmacologic or electrical therapy intervention or 1st degree block.\n* Current enrollment in any investigational trial(s) using devices implanted in the vascular system or enrolled in any experimental drug study(ies) within three months of study entry.\n* History of stroke or TIA within the past 14 days.\n* Source of stroke other than paradoxical embolization.\n* Hemodynamic instability or shock.\n* Hypercoagulable disorder.\n* Subjects with coagulation disorders who are unable to take antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Horst Sievert, MD","affiliation":"Cardio Vasculares Centrum - Sankt Katharien","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CardioVascular Center, Sankt katharinen","city":"FrankFurt/Main","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":50.11552,"lon":8.68417}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000004617","term":"Embolism"},{"id":"D000054092","term":"Foramen Ovale, Patent"},{"id":"D000019320","term":"Embolism, Paradoxical"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000016769","term":"Embolism and Thrombosis"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000006344","term":"Heart Septal Defects, Atrial"},{"id":"D000006343","term":"Heart Septal Defects"},{"id":"D000006330","term":"Heart Defects, Congenital"},{"id":"D000018376","term":"Cardiovascular Abnormalities"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000000013","term":"Congenital Abnormalities"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000013923","term":"Thromboembolism"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7474","name":"Embolism","asFound":"Embolism","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M27260","name":"Foramen Ovale, Patent","asFound":"Patent Foramen Ovale","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20990","name":"Embolism, Paradoxical","asFound":"Paradoxical Embolism","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Cryptogenic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16376","name":"Thrombosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18818","name":"Embolism and Thrombosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9122","name":"Heart Septal Defects, Atrial","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9121","name":"Heart Septal Defects","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9108","name":"Heart Defects, Congenital","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12","name":"Congenital Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20193","name":"Cardiovascular Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16372","name":"Thromboembolism","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"}]}},"hasResults":false}
