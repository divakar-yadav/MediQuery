Half the participants were randomized to the preventive clinic group and the other half to control group with the usual treatment: one visit to the outpatient clinic three months after discharge with a diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)","detailedDescription":"Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for recurrent stroke. Several studies have shown that less than 40% of stroke survivors are treated to target one year after stroke The investigator performed a feasibility study to test a model of treating this important risk factor in a hospital setting The investigator used a stepwise escalation of treatment of both blood pressure and blood cholesterol to individual targets according to patients' diagnosis of stroke, comorbidity and age"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants
