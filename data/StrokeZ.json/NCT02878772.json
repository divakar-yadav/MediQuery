Therefore, immune intervention, as a new therapeutic strategy, is worthy of exploration. Here, investigators tested the inflammation modulator, vinpocetine, for its effect on the outcomes of stroke. For this multi-center study, investigators recruited 60 patients with anterior cerebral circulation occlusion and onset of stroke that had exceeded 4.5 hours but lasted less than 48 hours. These patients, after randomly division into two groups, received either standard management alone (controls) or standard management plus vinpocetine (30 mg per day intravenously for 14 consecutive days, Gedeon Richter Plc., Hungary)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Immunoregulation","Inflammation","Vinpocetine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"vinpocetine group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Aspirin, 10mg, po and 30 mg of the vinpocetine by intravenous infusion once daily, for fourteen consecutive days","interventionNames":["Drug: vinpocetine","Drug: Aspirin"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive aspirin only.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"vinpocetine","description":"30 mg of the drug by intravenous infusion once daily, for fourteen consecutive days, beginning within one hour after the baseline MRI and no later than 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.","armGroupLabels":["vinpocetine group"],"otherNames":["Cavinton"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"100mg, once daily, oral medication","armGroupLabels":["Control group","vinpocetine group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"changes in lesion volume","description":"changes in lesion volume from baseline (DWI) to day 7 (Flair)","timeFrame":"lesion volume from baseline to day 7"},{"measure":"brain inflammatory level","description":"brain inflammatory level (MRS) at day 7","timeFrame":"day 7"},{"measure":"extent of clinical improvement","description":"extent of clinical improvement at day 7 and 14, as measured by the changes on the NIHSS score from baseline to day 7 and 14","timeFrame":"from baseline to day 7 and 14"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"probability of excellent recovery","description":"probability of excellent recovery at day 90 (defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the mRS)","timeFrame":"at day 90"},{"measure":"cytotoxic edema","description":"cytotoxic edema of day 3 (ADC value).","timeFrame":"day 3"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\>18 years of age\n* Anterior-circulation ischemic stroke: All patients had symptoms of focal neurological deficits and simultaneous radiological evidence (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) of an ischemic brain lesion\n* measurable neurological deficit (NIHSS \\> 5)\n* interval between symptom onset and admission more than 4.5 hours and less than 48 hours.
