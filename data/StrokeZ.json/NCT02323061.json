A robot hand will be used and controlled by the system in real time based on EEG pattern for identification of motion intention for hand movements in the motor cortex. A randomized controlled trial study design will be adopted. All subjects will be assessed by clinical assessments including FMA and neuroimaging assessments using multimodal MR techniques before and after the training to evaluate training effectiveness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BCI-robot (I)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"EEG guided training based on ipsilesional EEG signals; Training for 20 sessions","interventionNames":["Procedure: BCI using EEG signals"]},{"label":"BCI-robot (IC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"EEG guided training based on both ipsilesional and contralesional EEG signals; Training for 20 sessions","interventionNames":["Procedure: BCI using EEG signals"]},{"label":"robot","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Training for 20 sessions","interventionNames":["Procedure: BCI using EEG signals"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"BCI using EEG signals","description":"A robot hand will be used and controlled by the system in real time based on EEG pattern for identification of motion intention for hand movements in the cortex.","armGroupLabels":["BCI-robot (I)","BCI-robot (IC)","robot"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"FMA-UE","timeFrame":"6-month followup"},{"measure":"ARAT","timeFrame":"6-month followup"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MAS","timeFrame":"6-month followup"},{"measure":"MRI","timeFrame":"6-month followup"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
