In order to investigate whether the improvement of paretic hand could facilitate the motor recovery of paretic arm and functional performances, the investigators also hypothesized that motor recovery and functional performances improvements of paretic arm and hand have strongly correlation.","detailedDescription":"Objective: To investigate the training effects of interlimb force coupling training on paretic hand and upper extremity outcomes in patients with chronic stroke; to analyze the relationship between motor recovery of paretic hand, arm and functional abilities.\n\nDesign: A double-blind randomized controlled trial with outcome assessment at baseline and after 4 weeks intervention.\n\nSetting: Department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei Veterans General Hospital.\n\nParticipants: Thirty-three subjects (mean age = 55.1 ± 10.5 y/o) with chronic stroke were recruited and randomized assigned to training (n=16) and control group (n=17).\n\nInterventions: Interlimb force coupling training task included different gripforce generation on the both hands.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: Barthel Index (BI), and the upper extremity motor control of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), Motor Assessment Score (MAS), and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). All assessment was executed by a blinded evaluator, and data management and statistical analysis was also conducted by a blinded statistic researcher."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Cardiovascular Disease","Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Stroke, Cerebrovascular accident, Rehabilitation, Upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Education & training consultation","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Education and training consultations were provided for subjects in control group during study period.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Bilateral movement training"]},{"label":"Bilateral movement training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise training of bilateral isometric handgrip force training group consisted of 60 minutes of bilateral isometric handgrip force training 3 days per week for 4 weeks (total 12 sessions)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Bilateral movement training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Bilateral movement training","description":"Exercise training of bilateral isometric handgrip force training group consisted of 60 minutes of bilateral isometric handgrip force training 3 days per week for 4 weeks (total 12 sessions)","armGroupLabels":["Bilateral movement training","Education & training consultation"],"otherNames":["Coupling movement"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper Extremity motor control of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE)","description":"Outcome measure was assessed before and after 4 weeks intervention.","timeFrame":"before and after 4 weeks intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel Index (BI)","description":"Outcome measure was assessed before and after 4 weeks intervention.","timeFrame":"before and after 4 weeks intervention"},{"measure":"Motor Assessment Score (MAS)","description":"Outcome measure was assessed before and after 4 weeks intervention.","timeFrame":"before and after 4 weeks intervention"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)","description":"Outcome measure was assessed before and after 4 weeks intervention.","timeFrame":"before and after 4 weeks intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. at least 6 months since stroke\n2. three or fewer incidents of unilateral stroke confirmed by taking the participant's medical history ability to follow researcher's instructions\n3. ability to flex and extend the paretic arm and hand\n4.
