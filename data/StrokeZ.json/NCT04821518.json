The time of test performance, the walked distance and steps made as well as the mean and maximum gait velocity and the calories burned were assessed using the above-mentioned Samsung Health application . ECG results were assessed with the use of ECG M-Trace Base II application described above. In addition, cardiological parameters such as: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and arterial blood saturation were assessed. The measurements were performed at rest and directly after SCMT and SCT. Additionally, after the tests, the level of dyspnoea and fatigue was assessed according to the modified Borg scale (score 0-10)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mobile Applications","Secondary
