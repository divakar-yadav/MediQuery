Eligibility applies to patients with symptomatic ischemic stroke seen within 4.5 h of onset with middle cerebral artery or distal internal carotid artery occlusion, no contraindication to intravenous tPA-mediated thrombolysis and eligible to endovascular treatment of stroke (i.e. thrombectomy). The study has been designed to have 80% power to detect a 80% decrease of infarct volume growth in the tPA-ketamine group at a two-sided type I error rate of 5%. For this purpose, at least 25 patients per arm should be enrolled.","detailedDescription":"Rationale - Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a double-sided molecule, with beneficial effect in acute ischemic stroke due to its intravascular fibrinolytic activity but with potential deleterious effect due to its ability to potentiate neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signalling (Nicole et al., 2001). Co-administration of sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine - a non-competitive inhibitor of NMDA receptor - was shown to improve efficacy of tPA-mediated thrombolysis following stroke in rodents (Gakuba et al, 2011).\n\nAims - To assess efficacy and safety of co-administration of ketamine with tPA compared with tPA-placebo infusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\nSample size estimates -With 25 patients per group, the trial has a 80% probability of detecting a 80% decrease of infarct volume growth in the tPA-ketamine group compared with the tPA-placebo group on day 1 after admission at a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.\n\nStudy outcomes - The primary efficacy outcome is cerebral infarction growth on diffusion weighted imaging between admission and day 1. The primary safety measure is mortality and/or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebral Infarct","Thrombolysis","Tissue-type plasminogen activator","Neuroprotection","Anesthetic agent","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tPA-placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"tPA infusion : 0.9 mg/kg (90 mg maximum), 10% of the total dose is administered as an initial IV bolus dose over 1 minute and the remainder of the dose is infused over 60 minutes.\n\nSaline infusion : 0.15 mL/kg IV bolus (maximum 15 mL) followed by an IV infusion of 0.15 mL/kg over 60 minutes (maximum 15 mL).","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"tPA-ketamine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"tPA infusion : 0.9 mg/kg (90 mg maximum), 10% of the total dose is administered as an initial IV bolus dose over 1 minute and the remainder of the dose is infused over 60 minutes.\n\nKetamine infusion : 0.15 mg/kg IV bolus (maximum 15 mg) followed by an IV infusion of 0.15 mg/kg over 60 minutes (maximum 15 mg).","interventionNames":["Drug: Ketamine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ketamine","description":"Co-administration of subanesthetic dose of ketamine with tPA for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke.","armGroupLabels":["tPA-ketamine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["tPA-placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral infarction growth on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging between admission and day 1.","timeFrame":"Day 1"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"day 0, day 1, day 7 and day 90"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"day 90"},{"measure":"Infarction volume on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging","timeFrame":"day 1"},{"measure":"T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery Imaging infarct volume","timeFrame":"day 90"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and/or death","timeFrame":"day 90"},{"measure":"Arterial patency","description":"Arterial patency will be assessed with the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Score on day 0 before and after thrombectomy (digital subtraction angiography) and day 1 (magnetic resonance angiography).","timeFrame":"day 0 (before and after thrombectomy) and day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Sudden focal neurological deficit attributable to acute ischemic stroke.\n* Age between 18 and 85.\n* Time from symptom onset less than 4.5 hours.\n* NIHSS score between 7 and 20.\n* Informed consent for participation.\n* Ketamine can be administered within 15 minutes after onset of tPA infusion.\n* MRI-based AIS diagnosis.\n* Middle cerebral (M1 or M2 segment) and/or distal internal carotid artery occlusion.\n* No intracranial hemorrhage on MRI.\n* Patient eligible for thrombectomy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication to IV tPA treatment.\n* Contraindication to ketamine.\n* Contraindication to MRI.\n* Contraindication to intravascular iodinated contrast media.\n* Consciousness level \\>1 on question 1a of NIHSS.\n* Pre-stroke mRS ≥3.\n* Concomitant medical illness that would interfere with outcome assessments and follow-up (e.g. advanced cancer or respiratory disease).\n* Previous participation in this trial or current participation in another investigational drug trial.\n* Infarct volume on diffusion weighted MRI more than 100 mL.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Caen","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Caen","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Emmanuel Touzé, MD PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33231064624","email":"touze-e@chu-caen.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":49.18585,"lon":-0.35912}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"11135617","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Nicole O, Docagne F, Ali C, Margaill I, Carmeliet P, MacKenzie ET, Vivien D, Buisson A.
