CR is estimated using variables for cognitive activity: years of education, professional status, socioeconomic status... Furthermore, brain reverse (BR) is a passive and quantitative model that depend on brain size and other quantitative aspects of the brain that explain differential susceptibility to functional impairment in the presence of pathology.\n\nFirstly, volume and localization of ischemic strokes have a great impact on CR and BR due to brain injury. On the other hand, CR influences the severity and the expression of cognitive diseases.\n\nThe investigators realize a prospective study in order to assess the impact of CR and BR on cognitive prognosis after a right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke in elderly patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","brain reserve","cognitive reserve","cognitive prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation","description":"cognitive prognosis, cognitive reserve, brain volume will be studied on patients with scale, questionnaire, magnetic resonance imaging","armGroupLabels":["neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"evaluation of cognitive prognosis","description":"measure will be performed with the Mattis dementia rating scale","timeFrame":"one year post Ischemic stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Volume of leucoencephalopathy","description":"measure will be performed with a MRI","timeFrame":"one year post Ischemic stroke"},{"measure":"volume of hippocampic","description":"measure will be performed with a MRI","timeFrame":"one year post Ischemic stroke"},{"measure":"brain injury","description":"measure will be performed with a MRI","timeFrame":"one year post Ischemic stroke"},{"measure":"volume of ischemic stroke","description":"measure will be performed with a MRI","timeFrame":"one year post Ischemic stroke"},{"measure":"evaluation of cognitive reserve","description":"measure will be performed with the Cognitive reserve index questionnaire","timeFrame":"one year post Ischemic stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ≥70 years old\n* right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke\n* hospitalized in neurovascular unit of Pierre Wertheimer hospital between January 2015 to January 2016\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication for MRI\n* Hemorrhagic stroke\n* Aphasia","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pierre Krolak Salmon, MD","affiliation":"Hospices Civils de Lyon","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hôpital des Charpennes","city":"Lyon","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.74848,"lon":4.84669}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","asFound":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
