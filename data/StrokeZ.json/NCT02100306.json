Less than half of stroke patients regain use of their arm and hand. There is currently no intervention regime that is the gold standard, despite the variety of therapeutic techniques used to treat the upper extremity post-stroke. The use of external feedback to improve motor learning is a technique that has been less studied but shows promise. Therefore, the purpose of this proof of principle study it to test whether different auditory feedback frequencies can facilitate reaching ability in people with stroke. In addition brain scans will be collected that will enable us to determine how stroke severity may impact on one's ability to improve with this technique.\n\nWe hypothesize that patients who receive less feedback (50% alternate) will have enhanced learning relative to the patients who receive more feedback (100%)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive:\n\nAuditory Feedback 100% Auditory Feedback 50% alternate","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Auditory Feedback 100%","Behavioral: Auditory Feedback 50% alternate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Auditory Feedback 100%","description":"Patients will receive constant auditory feedback across training trials.","armGroupLabels":["Patients"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Auditory Feedback 50% alternate","description":"Patients will receive alternating auditory feedback (1 trial auditory feedback; 1 trial no auditory feedback) across trials","armGroupLabels":["Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in movement error from baseline","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of the study, an expected 3 hours per day for 2 weeks (5 days per week/10 days total)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in range of motion","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of the study, an expected 3 hours per day for 2 weeks (5 days per week/10 days total)"},{"measure":"Change in movement duration","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of the study, an expected 3 hours per day for 2 weeks (5 days per week/10 days total)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unilateral first time MCA ischemic stroke\n* Stroke patients should have some movement of shoulder/elbow (no movement of hand - e.g. hand, fingers - is OK)\n* \\> 2 months post\n* between 30-85 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* prior stroke\n* severe comprehension (or cognitive) deficit that compromises informed consent or understanding of instructions\n* contraindications to MRI (e.g. claustrophobia, metal implants)\n* neurodegenerative or psychiatric disease\n* apraxia\n* auditory deficits that would impair testing\n* prior musculoskeletal injury to back or upper extremity (including shoulder subluxation from stroke)\n* skin conditions that would preclude taping of goniometers","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Tea Lulic, MSc","role":"CONTACT","phone":"416 480-6100","phoneExt":"85405","email":"tlulic@sri.utoronto.ca"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Joyce Chen, PhD","affiliation":"Canadian Partnership for Stroke Recovery","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M4N 3M5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Related Info","url":"http://joycelchen.weebly.com/"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
