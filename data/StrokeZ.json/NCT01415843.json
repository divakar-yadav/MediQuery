During this phase, current practice among neuro-physiotherapists will be explored in relation to: the learning strategies used in stroke rehabilitation, the common interventions used in gait re-education, and the strategies adopted for the assessment and management of associated reactions.","detailedDescription":"Associated reactions are unintended and involuntary arm movements, normally seen as bending of the wrist and elbow, that may occur after stroke when a person is doing something effortful such as walking.\n\nThe objectives are:\n\n* To provide an insight into the learning strategies used by physiotherapists during the re-education of walking, including the verbal dialogue that takes place and any preferences (overt or subconscious) adopted for one type of learning strategy.\n* To develop and refine a description of what is meant by the term \"gait re-education\"\n* To provide an insight into how therapists currently manage associated reactions\n\nThis phase of the study will explore these objectives using direct non-participation observation of a number of physiotherapy treatment sessions. This will provide an insight into the nature of the therapy that takes place for retraining walking(e.g. the types of exercises commonly used) and the nature of the learning strategies frequently adopted, including the amount and content of explicit verbal instruction and feedback that is provided to patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* has suffered a stroke\n* is currently receiving active rehabilitation that includes gait re-education\n* is exhibiting upper limb deficits\n* is able to provide informed consent.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with stroke will be recruited from two NHS Trusts - Royal Bournemouth and Christchuch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Southampton City Primary Care Trust.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jane Burridge, Professor","affiliation":"University of Southampton","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch NHS Foundation Trust","city":"Bournemouth","state":"Dorset","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":50.72048,"lon":-1.8795}},{"facility":"Southampton City Primary Care Trust","city":"Southampton","state":"Hampshire","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":50.90395,"lon":-1.40428}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23559523","type":"RESULT","citation":"Johnson L, Burridge JH, Demain SH.
