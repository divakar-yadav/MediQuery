Early intervention has a better prognosis for them. However, patients may miss the regular rehabilitation programs due to Covid-19. Tele-rehabilitation could be a substitution for regular rehabilitation in epidemic situation, by which patients after stroke could have a functional improvement in upper limb motions, ADLs, and complex activities. Furthermore, there is no evidence yet of the effectiveness of telerehabilitation applied to inpatients after stroke.\n\nPurposes: This study is aimed to know if telerehabilitation could improve the motor function and general condition in inpatients after stroke and to explore the intervention methods for telerehabilitation.\n\nMethods: Inpatients after stroke would be recruited from a hospital of a medical university in Northern Taiwan. They will be divided into the telerehabilitation group (n = 12) and the bedside rehabilitation group (n = 12). Each patient will go on treatment in 10 sections, and each section is 15 or to 30 minutes. A single-blinded evaluator will do the pre-and post-evaluation during the treatment. The evaluations include the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS), Functional ambulation category (FAC), Modified Barthel index (MBI), Patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). In the end, a satisfaction questionnaire will be given.\n\nData analysis: Nonparametric tests will be used in the comparison of the pre-and post-evaluation data intergroup. The analysis will be carried out using SPSS Statistic (v20.0) and Î± \\< .05.\n\nKey words: tele-rehabilitation, stroke, inpatients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group (tele-rehabilitation)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each patient will go on a treatment with 10 sections, and each section is 15 or 30 minutes depends on patient's ability.\n\nThe intervention is used by the communication software to interact with each other in real time.
