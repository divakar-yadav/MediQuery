Secondary aims are to assess ease of use, liking, compliance, gastrointestinal tolerance, nutrient intake, anthropometric changes and safety.","detailedDescription":"Bolus enteral tube feeding (termed 'bolus feeding') is an increasingly common method of providing nutritional support to home enterally tube fed (HETF) patients, particularly those who are more active and/or require greater flexibility in their feeding regimen. However, current methods of bolus feeding are complex to administer, messy, may be unhygienic, and require and lead to a significant amount of plastic waste. Therefore, there is a clear need for a simpler and optimised way to provide bolus feeds. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of introducing a new enteral tube feed on health and feeding related quality of life, ease of use, liking, compliance, gastrointestinal tolerance, nutritional intake, anthropometry and safety. This is a prospective, longitudinal, 28-day intervention study with a 7-day baseline period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer","Neurological Disorder","Gastrointestinal Dysfunction","Oral Complication","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This is a prospective, longitudinal, 28-day intervention study with a 7-day baseline period.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bolus Pouch Feed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A 250 ml feeding pouch containing 400 kcal.","interventionNames":["Other: Bolus Pouch Feed"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Bolus Pouch Feed","description":"Following the 7-day baseline period, all patients will enter the 28-day intervention period, where they will receive the intervention feed daily.
