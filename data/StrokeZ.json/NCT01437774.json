Patients enrolled in the ReStore Trial will be randomized to treatment with the ReStore™ Thrombectomy Device (investigational treatment) or to treatment with a commercially available thrombectomy device It is expected that the investigational treatment safety profile in terms of clinically significant procedural adverse events will be comparable to the control group.","detailedDescription":"The objective of this study is to demonstrate substantial equivalence of the ReStore™ Thrombectomy Device with the legally marketed MERCI Retrieval System. The study will evaluate safety and efficacy of the ReStore™ Thrombectomy Device in subjects diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke who require mechanical thrombectomy. All eligible patients will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with either the investigational therapy or the control therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":210,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Concentric Thrombectomy Catheter","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control Arm","interventionNames":["Device: thrombectomy (ReStore or Merci)"]},{"label":"Reverse ReStore mechanical thrombectomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Reverse ReStore Device mechanical thrombectomy Each arm will use either ReStore or Merci as the primary thrombectomy device","interventionNames":["Device: thrombectomy (ReStore or Merci)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"thrombectomy (ReStore or Merci)","description":"Each arm will use either ReStore or Merci as the primary thrombectomy device","armGroupLabels":["Concentric Thrombectomy Catheter","Reverse ReStore mechanical thrombectomy"],"otherNames":["Mechanical Thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Primary efficacy endpoint is the achievement of revascularization in the targeted region post-procedure.
