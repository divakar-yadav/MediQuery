It has already proven a prognostic value. Until now, it hasn't proven a diagnostic value because it take a few hours to increase in the blood.\n\nIt could have in prognostic value for patients who have the symptoms for more than 24 hours.\n\nSTROkE is a diagnostic, prospective, monocentric study, conducted at University Hospital Center of Poitiers (France).\n\nThe aim is to determine the value of PS100B to exclude the diagnostic of a stroke in case of evocative symptoms, for patients who are out of delay for a thrombolysis or a thrombectomy.\n\nPatients eligible are the ones who present to the emergency department with symptoms evocative of stroke for more than 24 hours and less than 4 days. Patients included have a sample of blood withdrawn, in order to measure PS100B blood level.\n\nThe diagnostic of stroke is than confirmed or excluded by an adjudication comity, who are unaware of the result of PS100B blood level.\n\nThe diagnostic value of PS100B is determined with the help of a ROC curve."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["PS100B","stroke","out of delay","diagnostic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood sample in order to measure the value of PS100B"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":381,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic value of PS100B","description":"Determine the best couple sensibility / specificity of the blood value of PS100B with the help of a Receive Operating Charasteristics (ROC) curve for patients who present with symptoms evocative of stroke since more than 24 hours and less than 4 days","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Value of PS100B for ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes","description":"Comparison of the mean value of PS100B between patients with ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Value of PS100B and time delay since the beginning of the symptoms","description":"Stratification of the value of PS100B with the delay of apparition of the symptoms and realization of the blood sample","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Prognostic value of PS100B","description":"Comparison of the value of PS100B and the patient's outcomes 28 days after inclusion.
