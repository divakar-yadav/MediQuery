Both groups received usual care. The intervention group received even 20 minutes bed-cycling 5 days per week with a maximum of 15 sessions. Functional outcome was measured with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index and walking with the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). Measurements were performed pre- and post-intervention (3 weeks), and at 3-months follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Exercise","Bedcycling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"RCT","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Usual care and bedcycling.","interventionNames":["Other: Exercise"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exercise","description":"Bedcycling","armGroupLabels":["Exercise group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"Functional Outcome","timeFrame":"Baseline 24-48 hours after onset, postintervention 3 weeks after baseline and follow up 3-months after baseline."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Barthel ADL-Index","description":"ADL","timeFrame":"Baseline 24-48 hours after stroke onset, postintervention 3-weeks after baseline and follow up 3-months after baseline."},{"measure":"Change in 6-Minutes Walking test (6MWT)","description":"Walking Ability","timeFrame":"Baseline 24-48 hours after stroke onset, postintervention 3-weeks after baseline and follow up 3-months after baseline."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n* Age over 18 years.\n* Diagnose stroke with The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 7-42 points.\n* Ability to understand the Swedish language.\n* Approval of medical responsible physician to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nâ€¢ Medical or neurological diseases that can affect the performance of the exercise and severe cognitive impairment.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Paul Enthoven, PhD","affiliation":"Linkopings University,Sweden","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33704913","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Sandberg K, Kleist M, Enthoven P, Wijkman M.
