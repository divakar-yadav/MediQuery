In particular, limitations in arm reaching movements are prominent and correlate strongly with patients' impairment levels. Because activities of daily living often involve the UEs, retraining reach and grasp skills is critical for return to a full quality-of-life. Yet, the training parameters required for effective rehabilitation of UE function are not known. Recent evidence suggests that high-speed movements during training are effective at improving arm movements in individuals with chronic stroke. Hence, fast movements generating large errors, would promote the restoration of the feedforward controllers and therefore improves arm movements and UE functions in individuals with chronic stroke. Because the cerebellum is involved in learning feedforward controllers from motor errors, the improvements would be proportional to the integrity of the cerebellar-cortical networks.\n\nA double-blind quasi-randomized controlled study will be carried out in chronic post-stroke survivors. Participants will be assigned to either the speed-bias training group or a dose equivalent accuracy-bias training group (control) and will receive 4 days of training over a 1week period by a trained Occupational or physical therapist. Behavioral, EMG, and MRI data will be acquired within two weeks before, 3 days post, and one month after intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Physical therapy","neurorehabilitation","motor function","neuroplasticity","neuroimaging","MRI","TDI","Hemiparesis","occupational therapy","patient focused","motor learning","motor control","skill acquisition","skill training","motor recovery","task-oriented training","task-specific training","arm function","upper extremity","arm therapy","physical rehabilitation","arm rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessments will be done by a blinded and standardized clinical researcher","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Speed-biased complex motor skill training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will perform 400 complex movements per day over 4 days over a one-week period.
