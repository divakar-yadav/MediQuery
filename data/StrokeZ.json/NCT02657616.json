What other thromboembolic complication rates resulting from the use of these treatment strategies? What heavy bleeding rates resulting from the defined management strategies? The analysis is based on a data set of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)(01/01/2010 - 30/06/2014). 2010 is used as the reference period and 01/01/2011-30/06/2013 as the inclusion period. The minimum observation time per patient is 12 months.\n\nUsed is a data base of the AOK PLUS as well as the AOK Baden-Württemberg and AOK Bayern.\n\nThe aim of the study is to compare clinical outcomes between the different treatment strategies (frequency of events and time to first event). The influence of alternative treatment strategies is measured on the basis of three different methodological approaches: unadjusted comparison of event council and time to first event between the defined patient groups; matched-pair comparison (propensity score matching) between the different groups of patients (treatment strategies) and multivariate analysis using time to event (Cox proportional hazards model) as the dependent variable."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke Prophylaxis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":204464,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No anticoagulation with VKA/NOAC","description":"No prescriptions of vitamin-k-antagonists/novel anticoagulants in all observational period; No prescriptions of low molecular weight heparins/Clopidogrel during observation period to the extent of more than 30 days."},{"label":"Anticoagulation with vitamin-k-antagonists","description":"The patient should be treated stable during the observation period with vitamin-k-antagonists (at least one prescription per half-year).
