It accounts for about 20% of all strokes worldwide and mainly includes subtypes such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Multimodal computed tomography including non-contrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion, is of great important in understanding pathophysiological changes, evaluating prognosis and guiding interventions in these diseases.","detailedDescription":"Study overview: The data of the population in the MACTAHS study will be prospectively collected. The CT strategies for acute hemorrhagic stroke are mainly three categories: non-contrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion. Each participants will be followed at least until 1 year after discharge. Finally, investigators will clarify the prognostic value of multimodal CT for patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nSample size: About 10000 patients will be enrolled in this study. All the population will be expected to undergo non-contrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion.\n\nStudy endpoints: Neurological functional outcomes, delayed ischemia and infarction, recurrent bleeding, cognition and emotional dysfunction, systemic in-hospital systemic complications, rehabilitation and recovery status will be evaluated and follow-up would be completed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke","Multimodal CT","Prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Testing populations","description":"All patients with the possibility of acute hemorrhagic stroke and suitable for multimodal CT examination","interventionNames":["Device: Multimodal CT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Multimodal CT","description":"Non-contrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion","armGroupLabels":["Testing populations"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. 0 - No symptoms.\n\nNo significant disability.
