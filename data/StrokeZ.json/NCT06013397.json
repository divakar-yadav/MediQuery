The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nClarify the curative effects of ketogenic diet in the treatment of MELAS disease.\n\nPrevent the aggravation of MELAS disease, and improve the quality of life of patients.\n\nProvide reliable evidence-based medical basis for the clinical application of ketogenic diet in the treatment of MELAS syndrome patients.\n\nThe clinical data of the participants treated with ketogenic diet will be collected, including the completion of ketogenic diet and clinical data at the start of treatment and after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months","detailedDescription":"Ketogenic diet initiation and follow-up:\n\n1. Before starting ketogenic diet treatment, patients with abnormal indexes such as liver, kidney, lipid, humoral immunity, hematuria, routine biochemical, electrolyte, trace elements and bone metabolism should be excluded, energy and nutrients should be calculated according to their height and weight, and patients will be taught with ketogenic diet treatment education\n2. Patients were initiated ketogenic diet after a short period of fasting (fasting no more than 48 hours). After treatment was initiated, 13 of the calculated target energy was given on the first day, 23 of the target energy was given on the second day, and the target amount was reached on the third day. Nutritionists made appropriate adjustments to the target energy according to the level of blood keto measured by patients\n3. Weekly follow-up via telemedicine system or social media, outpatient follow-up at the initiation of ketogenic therapy and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months respectively. Outpatient follow-up was done in a joint clinic with a dietitian and a neurologist to evaluate the effects and side effects of ketogenic therapy on a compliant diet and related clinical examinations\n\nClinical data collection:\n\n1. Demographic information and Medical history collection Gender, age, education level age of onset, genetic test, drug use, past history, personal history, family history\n2. Clinical symptom collection According to the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale(NMDAS), including migraine headaches, seizures, stroke-like episodes and etc.\n3. Biochemical indicators Blood glucose, keto, lactate and pyruvate monitoring, dietary status, dietary ratio changes, energy changes, weight changes\n4. Cognitive function assessment Cognitive function was assessed using Fepsy software\n5. Diagnostic Examination Cranial MRI, scalp EEG"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["MELAS Syndrome","Ketogenic Dieting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"self pre-and post-control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"It is a self pre- and post-control, which compares the outcomes of the ketogenic diet with the status that did not receive ketogenic treatment","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Ketogenic diet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Ketogenic diet","description":"Ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate and moderate protein diet pattern, suitable for refractory epilepsy, glucose carrier protein 1 deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, tumors and some genetic metabolic diseases.
