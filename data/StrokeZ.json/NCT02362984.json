Standard therapy used in the study will consist of: aspirin 80 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, vitamin B complex, and citicholine 250 mg/2 mL twice daily.\n\nAfter hospital admission and diagnosis, patient will be handled according to the standard management for acute ischemic stroke applicable in the hospital. Right after the patient is confirmed eligible to the study, the treatment(s) will be switched immediately into the study's regimens. Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy will be performed at baseline, day 4, and day 8 of treatment (end of study); while safety examinations will be performed at baseline and end of study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["DLBS1033","acute ischemic
