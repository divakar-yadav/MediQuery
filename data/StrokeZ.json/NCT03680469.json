Those new interventions constitute a landmark change in stroke treatment. Since early mobilizing patients after stroke as early as possible might prevent immobility-related complications and promote brain recovery, previous studies supported that early mobilization should commence at some point within 72 hours of stroke. However, increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemia-reperfusion injury underlies concerns early mobilization of patients treated with rtPA or ET. Bedside, a limited amount of research has investigated what specific timing for starting early mobilization after intravenous IV rtPA or ET would optimize recovery potential during the acute period after cerebral infarction. Further research is needed to understand whether the outcomes resulting from starting mobilization within 72 hours of onset for a stroke treated with rtPA or ET is better than that of starting mobilization later. Therefore, the purpose of the study will to test the hypothesis that combining early out-of-bed mobilization within 72 hours of stroke onset with treated by IV rtPA or ET would result in a greater benefit than standard early rehabilitation within 72 hours of stroke onset with treated by IV rtPA or ET."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Acute","Early intervention","Mobilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":122,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"standard early rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The standard early rehabilitation program after acute stroke is an intervention regularly utilized in the stroke center of National Taiwan University Hospital.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: standard early rehabilitation"]},{"label":"adding early out-of-bed mobilization","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The adding early out-of-bed mobilization treatment will be defined as the patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive out-of-bed mobilization treatment in addition to standard early rehabilitation care.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: standard early rehabilitation","Behavioral: adding early out-of-bed mobilization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"standard early rehabilitation","description":"The standard early rehabilitation program is an intervention regularly utilized in the stroke center of National Taiwan University Hospital.
