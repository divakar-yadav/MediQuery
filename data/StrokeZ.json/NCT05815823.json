Two groups of patients were created. Group I also underwent 20 sessions of upper extremity robot-assisted therapy for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, for 30 minutes per session, in addition to receiving conventional therapy (5 days a week for 4 weeks, 1 hour each day). Group II only got traditional therapy. Each patient was assessed both before and after the procedure.\n\nThe Barthel Index (BI), the Fugl Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to assess the patients' pain, daily living activities, and upper extremity motor function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["the Effect of Virtual Reality on Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["stroke","upper extremity","robot-assisted therapy","armeo"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"conventional therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20 sessions of conventional therapy was applied for 5 days a week for 4 weeks, 1 hour a day","interventionNames":["Other: conventional therapy"]},{"label":"robot-assisted therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20 sessions of upper extremity robot-assisted therapy was applied for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, 30 minutes a day.","interventionNames":["Other: robotic exercise therapy","Other: conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"robotic exercise therapy","description":"Functional exercise programs such as collecting rain in a glass, grating vegetables, goalkeeper, cleaning the stove, watering flowers, wiping windows, catching fish, and exploring landscapes were applied by robotic games to the patients","armGroupLabels":["robot-assisted therapy"],"otherNames":["robotic exercise"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional therapy","description":"streching, range of motion, strengthening, balance and walking exercise","armGroupLabels":["conventional therapy","robot-assisted therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"FMA-UE scale","description":"FMA-UE evaluates the hemiparetic arm's mobility, including reflexes, the presence of synergies, and each of the upper limb's independent motions, including grasp.
