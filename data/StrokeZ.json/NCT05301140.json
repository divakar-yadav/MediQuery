Before and after Vivistim System implant, patient data will be collected and reported throughout the therapy process. Physicians or sites will receive appropriate remuneration for the effort and cost involved in collecting and transmitting this data to MicroTransponder Inc.","detailedDescription":"The registry is a data repository of information on patients considering implant of the Vivistim System. The Vivistim System is an FDA approved (P210007) device used to help improve upper limb motor deficits after a stroke. Most patients entered into the registry will go on to be implanted with the System although those who decide not to move forward with the implant procedure can still have data collected as a non-implant comparison group (as long as either or both FM-A / WMFT assessments were collected). The primary purpose of the registry is to provide real-world usage and outcomes data on the Vivistim System. The patient outcome registry will collect acute and long-term follow-up data on Vivistim implanted patients treated with Paired Vagus Nerve Stimulation (Paired VNS™) post-FDA approval.\n\nHistorical and implant information as well as quality of life information will be gathered on patients who consider implant of the Vivistim® System. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation, as well as yearly thereafter for up to three (3) years post-implant. Patients who decide not to have the Vivistim System implanted can continue to have data collected for comparison purposes.\n\nContributing sites and physicians will have access to their own site data and can have anonymized summary analyses on all aggregated data; sites will not have access to other sites' individual level data. Physicians can then use the above information to facilitate patient selection and treatment. Publication (oral or written) of data in the registry, other than individual site data, will not be permitted without the express written advance approval of MicroTransponder, Inc. and the other physicians contributing to the dataset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Problem"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Paired Vagus Nerve Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Vivistim System","description":"VNS Paired with rehabilitation movements"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment (FM-A)","description":"Change in Fugl Meyer Assessment score","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)","description":"Change in Wolf Motor Function Test score","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)","description":"Change in Stroke Impact Scale","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Motor Activity Log (MAL)","description":"Change in Motor Activity Log","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients implanted with the Vivistim System for upper limb deficits associated with an ischemic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Not eligible for surgery","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"22 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Ischemic stroke patients implanted with the Vivistim System","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Brent Tarver, BSEE","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8323305315","email":"brent@microtransponder.com"},{"name":"Diana Hansen","role":"CONTACT","phone":"936-648-9329","email":"diana@microtransponder.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Mt.
