As this is a First-In-Man (FIM) study assessing OTR4132-MD, it is designed as a single ascending dose (SAD) to evaluate the safety, tolerability of a single intra-arterial injection of OTR4132-MD in AIS patients treated with combined thrombolysis and thrombectomy.\n\nThe FIM will include up to 18 patients in up to five dose groups. Each group will comprise 3 subjects. This FIM study will also monitor a dose response relationship in humans: lesion volume change throughout the study period. Patients will be given a single intra-arterial injection of OTR4132-MD with a predefined dose of OTR4132. In the first dose group, the OTR4132 dose is 0.20 mg.\n\nThe results of this study will serve as a groundwork for the design of a pivotal study in the intended patient population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","FIM","OTR3"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"open study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OTR4132MD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"one medical device (10mL) of one of the 5 available concentrations (20 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, 150 μg/mL, 200 μg/mL) will be administrated as a one shot-dose to the patient.\n\nThe respective total dose of OTR4132 received by a patient will be one of the following: 0,20 mg, 0,50 mg, 1 mg, 1,5 mg and 2 mg.","interventionNames":["Device: OTR4132MD"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"OTR4132MD","description":"According to Regulation (EU) 2017/745(MDR), OTR4132-MD is an implantable medical device, for short term use which is specifically intended for use in direct contact with systemic circulation system.\n\nOTR4132-MD is by definition intended to come into contact with the patient when being injected.
