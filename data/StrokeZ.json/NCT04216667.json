The PLEA trial is designed to test the hypothesis whether posterior wall isolation (PWI) with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), PWI plus left atrial appendage electrical isolation (LAAEI) with PVI and PWI plus LAAEI plus coronary sinus isolation (CSI) with PVI is superior to the standard approach alone (i.e. PVI alone) in decreasing the incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-atrial arrhythmia recurrences."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Catheter Ablation","Arrhythmia Recurrence","Embolic Stroke","Mortality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A total of 932 patients will be randomized with equal allocation to one of four treatment groups.
