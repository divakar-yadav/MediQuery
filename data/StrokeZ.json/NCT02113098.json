Whereas about 15% of individuals could give up to participate in the study during their course (dropout rate), we determined a number of 20 participants in each group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait Disorders, Neurologic"],"keywords":["Stroke","Gait","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treadmill, ankle load","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will perform gait training on a treadmill with added load to the non-paretic lower limb","interventionNames":["Other: Treadmill, ankle load"]},{"label":"Treadmill","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group (active comparator) will perform gait training on a treadmill","interventionNames":["Other: Treadmill"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Treadmill, ankle load","description":"The experimental group will perform gait training on a treadmill (Gait Trainer 2®) with added load to the ankle of the non-paretic lower limb, plus physical therapy correction for restore gait symmetry.
