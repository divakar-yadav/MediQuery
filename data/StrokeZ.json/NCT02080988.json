The objective of this study is to measure the cough force produced via citric acid inhalation challenge, and determine if those with severe aspiration with severe dysphagia have more weak cough force during reflexive cough testing that those post-stroke patients with no signs of aspiration or dysphagia after stroke.\n\nWe also aimed to measure the strenght of the respiratory measures with the use of surface EMG."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","deglutition disorders","cough","aspiration pneumonia","diaphragm","respiratory function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Silent aspirators","description":"Stroke patients with dysphagia with severe aspiration"},{"label":"Non aspirating, no dysphagia group","description":"Stroke patients with no dysphagia and no evidence of aspiration"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Coughing force","description":"Coughing force as assessed by reflexive cough test","timeFrame":"baseline one time"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Coughing force during voluntary coughing","timeFrame":"baseline one time"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Spirometry findings (Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume at one second)","timeFrame":"baseline one time"},{"measure":"Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure","timeFrame":"baseline one time"},{"measure":"Root mean square values of respiratory muscles","timeFrame":"baseline one time"},{"measure":"Diaphragm excursion as assessed by M mode sonography","timeFrame":"baseline one time"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Confirmed stroke lesions\n* Confirmed aspiration during vfss or fees examinations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Episode of acute pneumonia or pulmonary embolism at time of enrollment\n* Previous history of chronic respiratory disorders or other systemic disorders that may affect respiratory function ( ex, rheumatoid disease, spinal cord injury)\n* Stroke patients with multiple brain lesions\n* Episode of Diaphragm weakness due to peripheral polyneuropathy or unilateral phrenic nerve palsy\n* Previous episode of abdominal or thoracic surgery within one year of enrollment\n* Concomitant diagnosis of myopathy, muscular dystrophy or other disorders that may affect respiratory muscles.\n* Episode of rib fracture within one year of enrollment\n* Chronic alcoholism\n* Patient with previous diagnosis of dementia or with impaired cognitive function that may limit full participation at the evaluation\n* Patient with tracheostomy state","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients with dysphagia with aspiration","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sun Im, Md PhD","affiliation":"The Catholic University of Korea","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Geun Young Park, MD PhD","affiliation":"The Catholic University of Korea","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Bucheon St Mary's Hospital","city":"Bucheon","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.49889,"lon":126.78306}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28900040","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Choi YM, Park GY, Yoo Y, Sohn D, Jang Y, Im S.
