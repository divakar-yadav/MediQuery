This will be done by placing participants in a seated position on a force platform, that will measure centre of pressure displacements during a leaning task in multiple directions. The results of the limits of stability test will be compared to standard clinical Measures of trunk control and functional balance, to see if there is a relationship between both ways of measuring. And how balance and trunk control are affected in the subacute stroke population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Balance; Distorted"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":49,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Participants post stroke","description":"Severly affected patients in the subacute phase post stroke that are unable to walk without the help of one or two therapists to assist for balance and weight-carrying.

The COP distance between start and end position is calculated, as well as the COP length of the trajectory that it takes the participant to reach his or her maximum leaning position.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is used to assess functional balance. The scale consists of 14 items, for each item the minimum score is 0 points, the maximum score is 4 points. A total amount of 56 points can be achieved on the Berg Balance Scale which indicates a normal balance for adults. A score lower than 45 points in elderly indicates that individuals may be at greater risk of falling.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Trunk Impairment Scale","description":"The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) assesses static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination of trunk movement. The test consists of 17 items with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 23 points, which is calculated by adding up the scores from the subscales (0-7 Points for static sitting Balance, 0-10 Points for dynamic sitting Balance, 0-6 Points for coordination), with a higher scores for better trunk control.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Trunk Control Test","description":"The Trunk Control Tests consists of four items with a maximum score of 100 points. The patient is asked to turn in bed, come from lying to sitting at the bedside and stay seated at the bedside.
