However, caregivers can experience difficulties in accessing and fully utilising existing services due to the varying types of care needs and its intensities amongst stroke survivors.\n\nEcological momentary intervention (EMI) as an innovative and personalised intervention has shown great potential in supporting psychological well-being; yet, there are no studies on using EMI for the caregivers' psychological support. The proposed trial aims to reduce stroke caregivers' psychological distress by delivering EMI through instant messaging applications to provide personalised and real-time support led by healthcare professionals.\n\nStroke caregivers screened by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) with scores ranging from 5 to 19 will be recruited from multiple sites including community centres, rehabilitation centres and outpatient clinics in public hospitals in Hong Kong, and individually randomised into the intervention group (n=20) or control group (n=20). The intervention group will receive the personalised instant messages for 4 weeks. The control group will receive general health information and regular messages reminding them to participate in follow-up surveys. The primary outcome will be the score of PHQ-9 at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include anxiety, perceived stress, and caregiver burden."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Caregiver Burnout","Mobile Phone Use","Depressive Symptoms","Psychological Distress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"receive mobile messages supporting caregivers' psychological well-being, according to the participants' preferences in intervention group.","interventionNames":["Other: Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI)"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"receive general health information through a mobile message."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI)","description":"Using the messaging function of mobile devices, EMI offers a framework to deliver health information to the target population, corresponding to each individual's demands in terms of type (e.g., photo, text and/or voice message), timing, duration, and frequency of the messages, which are different to the features from other interventions","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change depressive symptoms by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Scale (questionnaire) at 4 weeks","description":"Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Scale: PHQ-9 is a scale for screening depression in primary care.
