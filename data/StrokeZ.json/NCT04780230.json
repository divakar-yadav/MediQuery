All the participants will receive individualized speech therapy based on the results of their speech assessment.\n\nFor the real tDCS group, an anodal high-definition tDCS of 2 milliamperes (mA) lasting for 20 minutes will be delivered to the orofacial area of the primary motor cortex (SM1) during speech therapy. For the sham tDCS group, stimulation given during speech therapy will only last for 30 seconds in order to cause a similar sensation on the scalp as the real stimulation group. There will be a total of 10 daily sessions during a 2-week period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysarthria","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"real
