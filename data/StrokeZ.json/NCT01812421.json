The patients will be classified as different adherence level at the end of the study according to their adherence condition.\n\nThis study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that controlling hypertension and its risk factors was more effective than those do not receive HHEP in reducing the recurrence of stroke and cardiovascular diseases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["To Investigate the Relationship Between the Adherence of HHEP After ISTIA and Stroke Recurrence or Cardiovascular Events."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Stroke or TIA (ISTIA) patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Hypertension Health Education Protocol (HHEP)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hypertension Health Education Protocol (HHEP)","armGroupLabels":["Ischemic Stroke or TIA (ISTIA) patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Nonfatal vascular events: ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke recurrence (ICD-9 431 or ICD-10 I61), or myocardial infarction(MI) (ICD-9 410 or ICD-10 I21).","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"vascular death (death within 30 days after a vascular event) and all-cause mortality.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants were eligible for this observational cohort study if they were age 18 years or older; Hospitalized for a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and concurrently diagnosed as hypertension; Provided consent to participate, and their data can be collected from Medical Record System of our hospital.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nWe will exclude people who are onset of symptoms 3 months after their ischemic stroke or TIA; The stroke events occurred before the baseline survey were identified from the Hospital Discharge Register retrospectively and excluded from the analyses.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"YeFeng Cai, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","email":"zizi_33@126.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Brain Center,Guangdong Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Guangzhou","state":"Guangdong","zip":"510120","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"YeFeng Cai, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","email":"zizi_33@126.com"},{"name":"ZiYi Zhou, Master","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Lin Wei, Master","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"XiaoPei Zhang, Master","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":23.11667,"lon":113.25}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000012008","term":"Recurrence"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11997","name":"Neoplasm Metastasis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14540","name":"Recurrence","asFound":"Recurrence","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
