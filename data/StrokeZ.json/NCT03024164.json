The investigators will include 3000 young adult (18-45 years old) patients with confirmed first-ever acute ischemic stroke in China. The main purpose of this study is to build the study cohort of young ischemic stroke patients in China, and to compare the prognosis and stroke recurrence of young patients with different ischemic stroke subtypes. Secondary objectives are trying to find biomarkers of stroke recurrence.","detailedDescription":"Approximately 10%-14% of all ischemic strokes occur in young adults ages 18 to 45 years old. Stroke etiology in this population differs by geographic region and has greater heterogeneity than in older individuals. Ascertain the definite etiologic classification in this young patients might be the key point to prevent the stroke recurrence and reduce the stroke burden. Advances in stroke diagnostic tests, particularly neuroimaging, refinement in classification schema. In this multi-center registry study conducted in China, we determine to explore the difference of prognosis and stroke recurrence of young patients with different ischemic stroke subtypes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["youth; etiology; prognosis; recurrence; biomarkers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"EDTA-blood and serum will be collected for future analysis"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Young adult stroke patients","description":"Young adult (18-45 years old) patients with confirmed first-ever acute ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: Treatment following current guidelines"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Treatment following current guidelines","description":"Treatment following current guidelines","armGroupLabels":["Young adult stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke recurrence","description":"Percentage of patients with the 1 year new vascular events, defined as any event of the following: Any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage)","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Post-stroke disability","description":"Modified Rankin Scale score changes (continuous) and dichotomized at percentage with score 0-2 vs. 3-6 at 3-month follow-up.","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular death","description":"Percentage of patients with the 3-month, 6-month and 1 year cardiovascular death caused by any event of the following: Any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage), sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other cardiovascular death including pulmonary embolism, rupture of aortic aneurysm, cardiovascular interventional therapy, and peripheral arterial disease.","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months and 1 year"},{"measure":"Other cardiovascular event","description":"Percentage of patients with the 3-month, 6-month and 1 year other cardiovascular event including non-lethal myocardial infarction, and non fatal heart failure.","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months and 1 year"},{"measure":"Other systemic embolism","description":"Percentage of patients with the 3-month, 6-month and 1 year other systemic embolism except for cerebral artery, coronary artery, and pulmonary artery.
