During this practice, the participant's real-world motion is replicated by an avatar's motion in the virtual world. To complete the activities, participant's must perform a wide range of functional arm movements while interacting with virtual objects. Individuals are asked to perform three such one-hour virtual ADL practice sessions per week over a participation period of approximately eight weeks.","armGroupLabels":["VOTA Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer upper extremity assessment","description":"Measure of upper extremity motor function","timeFrame":"Pre-assessment and Post-assessment (8 weeks)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"Measure of upper extremity motor function","timeFrame":"Pre-assessment and Post-assessment (8 weeks)"},{"measure":"Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)","description":"Cognitive assessment","timeFrame":"Pre-assessment and Post-assessment (8 weeks)"},{"measure":"Trail Making Test","description":"Cognitive assessment","timeFrame":"Pre-assessment and Post-assessment (8 weeks)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant is a hemiparetic stroke survivor;\n* Time since last stroke at least 3 months;\n* Participant has antigravity strength at the elbow to at least 45 degrees of active flexion in the stroke affected arm;\n* Participant has antigravity shoulder strength to at least 30 degrees each in active flexion, abduction/adduction, and 15 degrees in active rotation from an upright seated position in the stroke affected arm;\n* Participant has visual acuity with corrective lenses of 20/50 or better;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Existing participation in an upper extremity stroke rehabilitation program or planned participation during the study period;\n* Inability to understand and follow verbal directions;\n* Determination that participation would result in over exertion or significant discomfort or pain;\n* Determination that participation would result in significant agitation or elevated stress;\n* Withholding or withdrawal of consent by the participant;\n* Visual field deficit in either eye that impairs the ability to view the computer monitor;\n* Hemispatial neglect that impairs the ability process and perceive visual stimuli provided through the computer monitor;","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"UVA- HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital","city":"Charlottesville","state":"Virginia","zip":"22901","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.02931,"lon":-78.47668}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
