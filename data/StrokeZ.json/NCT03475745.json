However the mechanisms of language recovery after aphasic stroke is not fully understood. Investigators plan to detect the changes of functional and structural language networks after aphasic stroke by high-resolution MRI.Then Combined analyse functional and structural language network changes, establishing a prediction model for language outcome.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe proposed study is a observational trial that will include 50 patients diagnosed with post stroke aphasia from the neurology clinics at The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University. Aphasia battery of Chinese(ABC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at acute(\\~2weeks),subacute(3 months) and chronic phase(6months). Only routine drug therapy will be used.\n\nRelevance:\n\nCurrently there is little known about the recovery mechanisms of post-stroke aphasia.The proposed study intends to analyse functional and structural language network changes by high resolution MRI, which may reveal the potential recovery mechanism underlying post stroke aphasia.."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"],"keywords":["resting-state","DTI","aphasia","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aphasia","description":"Post
