Intra-venous thrombolysis with rt-PA within the first 4,5 hours is the only proven effective treatment. Prognosis is closely related to the recanalization rate that reaches only 30 to 50%. A new therapeutic strategy consisting in a sequential intravenous (IV) thrombolysis by rt-PA followed by 50UI/kg of IV tenecteplase (TNK) has been proposed in case of no recanalization after rt-PA. A case series of 13 consecutive patients treated by this association has been published in 2011. A high rate of recanalization without hemorrhagic transformation increase has been reported. However, efficiency and safety of this therapeutic have to be assessed in a randomized multi-centric study. Such a study is of great interest since interventional neuroradiology has not already shown superiority regarding IV rt-PA. Moreover interventional neuroradiologists specialists are only available in major hospital and an IV sequential strategy could provide an interesting alternative.\n\nMain study objectives:\n\nMain Clinical Objective:\n\nSequential thrombolysis should be associated with a significant better outcome at 3-month, assessed by the modified Rankin score (mRS).\n\nMain Radiological Objective:\n\nSequential thrombolysis should be associated with a higher rate of recanalization (TIMI 2b/3) at 24-hour.","detailedDescription":"This is a Phase 2, multi-center, national, randomized, biomedical study comparing two therapeutic strategies in ischemic stroke associated with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion.\n\nPatients will be included in two randomized arms and the new sequential treatment approach (rt-PA + tenecteplase) will be compared with the standard treatment (rt-PA alone)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nervous System Disorders","Cerebral Artery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rt-PA","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients treated by thrombolysis with rt -PA within 4h30 of the onset of symptoms to a proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion visible on a MRI 1 are pre- included.
