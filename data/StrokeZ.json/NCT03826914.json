Research on certain dietary supplements looks promising as a way to help reduce CVD risk factors. Studies show that supplementation of certain nutrients such as antioxidants, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins and minerals may effectively reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The dietary supplement CardioFlex Q10, which is high in the aforementioned components, was developed to help regulate the body's production of cholesterol, strengthen the arteries and heart, and reverse oxidation.\n\nThe overall objective of this study is to determine if 90 days of supplementing with CardioFlex Q10 can reduce CVD risk factors in adults, independent of other dietary or physical activity changes.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not daily supplementation with the dietary supplement CardioFlex Q10 for 90 days can reduce cardiovascular risk factors in healthy adults. The health markers that will be tested include the participant's waist circumference, body weight, body mass index (BMI), atherosclerosis risk factors (blood pressure, plethysmogram (PTG) wave form, heart rate variability, accelerated plethysmograph (APG) type (biological age of arteries)), and blood work including total plasma lipid profile (total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TGs)), kidney and liver function (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine), and inflammatory and endothelial function biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) ).\n\nAll health markers will be tested the day before starting the study and the day after the study is completed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Abnormalities","Heart Attack","Stroke","Hypertension"],"keywords":["dietary supplements","cardiovascular diseases","heart attack","stroke","hypertension","amino acids","electrolytes","antioxidants"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A 90-day double blinded controlled clinical trial","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"The selected participants will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to the experimental or control group.
