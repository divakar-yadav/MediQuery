Patients with persistent disability 6-24 months following an ischemic stroke will be enrolled following confirmation of eligibility. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to undergo a stereotactic surgery and receive a single administration of CTX0E03 Drug Product by intracerebral implantation or undergo sham surgery only (placebo). Patients will be followed for 12 months after surgery with follow-up assessments occurring at various time points over the 12 months. All eligible patients will be assigned a standardized Physical Therapy (PT) program. Patients will complete their daily PT exercises at home for 12 weeks after their surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Chronic Stroke","Hemiparesis","Arm Paralysis"],"keywords":["Efficacy","Neural Stem cells","Intracerebral","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular disorders","Brain diseases","Stereotactic surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CTX0E03 Drug Product and delivery device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20 million neural stem cells","interventionNames":["Combination Product: CTX0E03 Drug Product and delivery device"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham Surgery","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"CTX0E03 Drug Product and delivery device","description":"Includes stereotactic surgery and a burr hole drilled through the skull to allow for a one time intracerebral injection of 20 million CTX0E03 Drug Product stem cells into an area of the brain adjacent to the area affected by the stroke.","armGroupLabels":["CTX0E03 Drug Product and delivery device"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Sham surgical comparator includes stereotactic surgery and a partial thickness burr hole drilled into the skull.
