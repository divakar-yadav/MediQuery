The MTS of the ankle was used to determine the passive range of movement at different movement velocities, V1 (as slow as possible) and V3 (as fast as possible) with the relative difference between a slow and a fast velocity passive stretch determining the dynamic component of the muscle contracture for the joint. At each visit, the investigator measured 2 joint angles by goniometer: the R1 angle which is the angle of catch after a fast velocity (V3) stretch and the R2 angle defined as the passive joint range of movement following a slow velocity (V1) stretch. The R2 - R1 value indicated the level of the dynamic component of spasticity in the joint.
