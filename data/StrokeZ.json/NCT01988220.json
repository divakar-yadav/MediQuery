Sensory impairments are often overlooked in the therapeutic setting, although they lead to slower motor recovery.\n\nWorking hypothesis: The overall goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a sensory discrimination reeducation oriented therapeutic program to the lower limb of stroke patients with sensory impairments. We assume that subjects to both groups will make progress, which will be more significant in the experimental group.\n\nMethods: Study population and design: Sixty individuals with chronic sensory impairment following a stroke will be recruited. Patients will be randomly assigned to sensory retraining treatment or to sensory stimulation treatment. Treatment will consist of ten 45 minute long intervention sessions, carried out within a 6 weeks period, and a home exercise program. The person conducting the assessments will be blind to the treatment allocation of the subjects. Outcome measures: The efficacy of the intervention will be determined in relation to the International Classification of Functionality (ICF) developed by the World Health Organization and will include assessments at the three domains defined by this model: 1. Body structure and function - determined by measures of the sensory capacity of the lower more affected limb; 2. Activities - determined by measures of balance and gait; 3. Participation - determined by measures of well-being and social reintegration.\n\nTwo new outcome measures, for ankle and knee position sense and for texture discrimination of the foot, will be developed within this study. Data reliability measures on healthy population, and test - retest measures in post stroke population with be collected.\n\nIntervention: The experimental group will be treated by a perception learning oriented protocol for sensory reeducation, to improve identification, localization and discrimination of sensory stimuli, including electrical stimulation, texture and hardness discrimination and position sense training. The control group will receive the same stimuli without the attentive learning and discriminating component.\n\nImportance: Scientific proof and focused recommendations for a potent therapeutic method for the post-stroke population, allowing them better participation and quality of life.\n\nKey words: Stroke, sensory impairment, perceptual learning, lower limb, clinical trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Sensory Deficits"],"keywords":["stroke","sensory deficit","sensory retraining","perceptual learning","lower extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"sensory retraining","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"sensory identification and discrimination training. using different attention and sensation modalities for sensory retraining","interventionNames":["Other: sensory retraining"]},{"label":"repeated exposure to sensory input","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: repeated sensory input"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"sensory retraining","armGroupLabels":["sensory retraining"],"otherNames":["perceptual learning","sensory reeducation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"repeated sensory input","description":"sensory stimulation without attentive learning focus","armGroupLabels":["repeated exposure to sensory input"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Timed Up and Go test","description":"Standing up from a chair, walking three meters, turning around and coming back to sitting. time is assessed.","timeFrame":"pre - up to a week before intervention, post - after 6 weeks, follow-up - 3 months after"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Von Frey monofilaments foot identification threshold","description":"Assessment of threshold for Von Frey monofilaments identification, using the levels method.
