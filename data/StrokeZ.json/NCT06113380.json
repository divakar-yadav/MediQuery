The goal is to reduce the workload of rehabilitation therapists.","detailedDescription":"NTUH-ii is an upper limb rehabilitation robot. The aim of this robot is to reduce the workload of rehabilitation therapists and make the rehabilitation process more effective.\n\nThe robot can complete rehabilitation tasks, such as elbow flexion/extension, shoulder flexion/extension, and shoulder horizontal abduction/adduction, etc. By giving the desired trajectory, the robot can lead patients to do the tasks in passive mode or active mode.\n\nHowever, curative rehabilitation should include the motion intention of patients. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of rehabilitation effect by combining the sensors (such as sEMG, IMU) to obtain the motion intention of patients and give the assistive movement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rehabilitation by rehabilitation robot","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Rehabilitation therapists will determine the training mode based on the subject's movement ability.\n\nPassive training mode Active-assistive training mode","interventionNames":["Device: NTUH-ii, am upper limb rehabilitation robot arm"]},{"label":"Traditional rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Traditional upper limb physical therapy is performed by the therapist.","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional upper limb physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"NTUH-ii, am upper limb rehabilitation robot arm","description":"Rehabilitation programs are planned based on the subject's capabilities, and the differences between assisted rehabilitation with a robot and traditional rehabilitation are compared.","armGroupLabels":["Rehabilitation by rehabilitation robot"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Traditional upper limb physical therapy","description":"Traditional upper limb physical therapy is performed by the therapist.","armGroupLabels":["Traditional rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Fugl-Meyer assessment upper extremity, higher scores indicate a better outcome.","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Fugl-Meyer assessment upper extremity, higher scores indicate a better outcome.","timeFrame":"Before the task and right away the experiment, 3 months, 6 months post intervention."},{"measure":"sEMG analyzation","description":"using sEMG sensors to obtain the sEMG signal and applying 3Ã—2 ANOVA to analyze.","timeFrame":"Before the task, right away the experiment and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months post intervention."},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"To measure the increase of muscle tone, score from 0 to 4, higher scores indicate the higher muscle tone.","timeFrame":"Before the task, right away the experiment and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months post intervention."},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"To quantify upper extremity movement ability through timed single- or multiple-joint motions .and functional tasks.","timeFrame":"Before the task, right away the experiment and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months post intervention."},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","description":"A self-report questionnaire that evaluates disability and health-related quality of life after stroke.
