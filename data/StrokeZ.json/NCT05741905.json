Intravenous thrombolysis is a major therapy for acute ischemic stroke, however, nearly half of patients failed to benefit from it. It is necessary to find new interventions combined to intravenous thrombolysis, which promote the efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis. The investigators' previous studies suggested levofloxacin to be a newly identified neuro-protective agent, which could reduce infarct volume and improve neurologic function in animal models. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin combined with intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke patients, the prospective, multicenter and randomized controlled trial was designed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Intravenous thrombolysis","Levofloxacin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Levofloxacin group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Levofloxacin 200mg twice per day is administrated.","interventionNames":["Drug: Levofloxacin"]},{"label":"Levofloxacin simulant group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Levofloxacin simulant 200mg twice per day is administrated.","interventionNames":["Drug: Levofloxacin simulant"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Levofloxacin","description":"Levofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotics and newly identified neuro-protective agent.
