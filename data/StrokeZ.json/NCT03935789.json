Although the residual effects of stroke affect many aspects of life, many aspects are not addressed by traditional rehabilitation treatments. In particular, persons with mild stroke, typically defined as a stroke with no or slight motor impairment and a high level of independence in basic activities of daily living, often experience emotional problems, subtle but significant cognitive impairment and decreased participation in productive, social and leisure activity. Despite these problems, persons with mild stroke are typically discharged to home without further referral to health or rehabilitation services other than follow-up with primary care physicians.\n\nThis application is in response to RFA PA-11-335 (Lab to Marketplace: Tools for Biomedical and Behavioral Research), a special 2-year Phase I SBIR program to accelerate the translation of behavioral research from academic to the marketplace. The project is based on the extensive research that developed and tested reliable and valid measures of activity participation (Activity Card Sort, or ACS) and cognitive skills supporting performance of simple and complex functional tasks (Functional Behavior Profile, or FBP). These measures have been used to guide treatments to help persons with mild cognitive impairment and their families support functional independence. These measures and the results of other studies will be used to build a dynamic online self-management tool designed to help persons with mild stroke develop individualized strategies that will support optimal recovery.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of Better Living After Stroke through Technology (BLAST) to help stroke survivors and family members return back to their productive and meaningful lives by proactively 1) helping them set their activity goals using ACS, 2) assessing their behavioral/functional capabilities using FBP, 3) recognizing symptoms indicative potential secondary stroke risks, 4) engaging support from online/community resources, and 5) offering tailored self-management recommendations using evidence-based strategies on how to achieve their activity goals and avoid secondary stroke based on their capabilities, stroke-related symptoms and available social resources.\n\nStroke survivors and family using the BLAST system are expected to have 1) better life satisfaction as measured by the Overall Recovery item of the Stroke Impact Scale; 2) increased activity as measured by Activity Card Sort; 3) better problem-solving and task performance as measured by Functional Behavior Profile; and 4) fewer caregiver concerns as measured by the Stroke Caregiver Needs Scale.\n\nSpecific Aims: 1) to evaluate the acceptability of BLAST ; and 2) to evaluate the preliminary effect of BLAST on self-efficacy, participation, and community reintegration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","occupational therapy","participation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single group feasibility study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BLAST","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants in this study will be assigned to this group to participate in the BLAST intervention.
