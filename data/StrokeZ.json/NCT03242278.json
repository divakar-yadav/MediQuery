objective is to assess the proportion of Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients receiving the standard dose of 20 mg of rivaroxaban or the reduced dose of 15 mg of rivaroxaban.\n\nThe secondary objective is to determine if dosing patterns for rivaroxaban may be influenced by baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) status (as a proxy for measured baseline renal function)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Non-valvular atrial fibrillation
