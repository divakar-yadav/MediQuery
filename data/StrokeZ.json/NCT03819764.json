The investigators are also calculating the cost effectiveness of the rehabilitation interventions.","detailedDescription":"The aims of the study are to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combining aerobic exercise training with upper extremity motor task practice to improve motor recovery following stroke. It is hypothesized that the neurophysiologic impact of aerobic exercise may augment motor recovery associated with motor task practice. To test this hypothesize, 60 individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited to participate in this randomized clinical trial. Following screening and informed consent, all participants will undergo an exercise stress test to determine response to maximal exertion. Following the stress test, baseline clinical assessments will be obtained to quantify upper extremity function, gait, endurance, and self-reported quality of life. Additionally, variables to determine degree of disability will be obtained. Individuals will be randomized to one of two interventions: 45 min of forced-rate aerobic exercise paired with 45 min of upper limb repetitive task practice or two back-to-back 45-minute sessions of upper limb repetitive task practice. The interventions will occur 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Outcomes assessing motor function and disability will be repeated at mid-treatment, end of treatment, and at 4 weeks, 6-months and 12-months following end of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"],"keywords":["stroke","aerobic exercise","forced exercise","repetitive task practice","arm function","upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aerobic Exercise & Repetitive Task Practice","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will perform the following:\n\n1. 45 minutes of cycling\n2. 45 minutes of upper extremity repetitive arm exercises","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic Exercise","Behavioral: Upper Extremity Repetitive Task Practice"]},{"label":"Upper Extremity Repetitive Task Practice Only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will perform the following:\n\n1. 90 minutes of upper extremity repetitive arm exercises","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Upper Extremity Repetitive Task Practice"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Aerobic Exercise","description":"Cycling on a recumbent stationary bike with a specialized motor that forces the individual to cycle approximately 30-35% faster than your self-selected speed","armGroupLabels":["Aerobic Exercise & Repetitive Task Practice"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Upper Extremity Repetitive Task Practice","description":"Repetitive arm exercises","armGroupLabels":["Aerobic Exercise & Repetitive Task Practice","Upper Extremity Repetitive Task Practice Only"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)","description":"This is a 33 item assessment of post-stroke upper extremity impairment.
