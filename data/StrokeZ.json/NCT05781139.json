It is recognized as a healthcare and social burden and remains challenging in terms of proper diagnosis and treatment.","detailedDescription":"Biomarkers are needed to identify at-risk individuals, stage their disease, and track disease progression. Such biomarkers should be noninvasive, inexpensive, and simple to acquire. Neurodegeneration biomarkers in CSF include neurofilament light (NfL), Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1). NfL for example increases in several neurologic conditions, including AD. In addition, NfL can be detected in serum using standard immunoassay formats. Higher CSF levels of CHI3L1 are seen in patients with neurological disorders such as MS patients experiencing relapses of MS. In addition, C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) is a crucial homeostatic chemokine expressed in lymphoid organs, and it is essential for the recruitment and compartmentalization of lymphocytes. In MS, CXCL13 regulates homing of B cells and subsets of T cells to inflammatory foci in CNS by interacting with the CXCR5 receptor. The levels of CXCL13 are elevated in the CSF of patients with MS compared to healthy controls, as well as in other neuroinflammatory diseases. CXCL13 may be considered a CSF biomarker of intrathecal B cell response, as its levels correlate with the count of B cells, the IgG index, and the presence and OCBs in the CSF.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assesses several cortical properties such as excitability, plasticity, and connectivity in humans. TMS has been applied to patients with dementia, enabling the identification of potential markers of the pathophysiology and predictors of cognitive decline; moreover, applied repetitively, TMS holds promise as a potential therapeutic intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dementia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early onset Alzhiemer","description":"before age of 65 and above age of 50","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: levels of Neurofilaments (NfL) in serum"]},{"label":"Late onset Alzhiemer","description":"Above the age of 65","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: levels of Neurofilaments (NfL) in serum"]},{"label":"Vascular dementia","description":"Any patient diagnosed with vascular dementia","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: levels of Neurofilaments (NfL) in serum"]},{"label":"control group","description":"persons who has no dementia","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: levels of Neurofilaments (NfL) in serum"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"levels of Neurofilaments (NfL) in serum","description":"the levels Neurofilaments (NfL) (Abcam, USA), C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) and Chitinase 3-like Protein 1 (Sigma-aldrich, Germany) will be determined in the serum and CSF (if available) in the different participant groups.","armGroupLabels":["Early onset Alzhiemer","Late onset Alzhiemer","Vascular dementia","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"detect difference between multiple types of dementia (Alzheimer's disease with early onset, and late-onset as well as multi-infarct dementia )","description":"detect difference between multiple types of dementia (Alzheimer's disease with early onset, and late-onset as well as multi-infarct dementia ) regarding clinical profile, biomarkers, and cortical excitability","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
