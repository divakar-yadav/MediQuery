In order to further clarify the main pharmacodynamic substances of Xingnaojing in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, this study intends to carry out a non-randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial. The primary hypothesis is that , compared with the control group, Xingnaojing will produce serial changes in plasma metabolites at baseline (pre-dose) and 7 days, as well as urine metabolites at baseline (pre-dose), 6 days, 7 days and 8 days. The serial changes may be the potential support to explain the intervention effect of Xingnaojing. All participants will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)entry score of 4-25. Participants who have planned or already received the intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment will be excluded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Xingnaojing injection group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive intravenously administered Xingnaojing injection, combined with guidelines-based standard care.\n\nInterventions:\n\nDrugs:Xingnaojing injection Other: Standard care (eg. antiplatelet drugs and statins)","interventionNames":["Drug: Xingnaojing injection"]},{"label":"Standard care group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects will receive guidelines-based standard care.\n\nInterventions:\n\nOther: Standard care (eg. antiplatelet drugs and statins)"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Xingnaojing injection","description":"Xingnaojing injection 20 ml+0.9% diluted sodium chloride injection 250ml, IV (in the vein), every 12 hours for 7 days.","armGroupLabels":["Xingnaojing injection group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Differences in Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at baseline.","description":"Differences in the content of Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole in plasma and urine samples between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at baseline.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Differences in Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at 6 days.","description":"Differences in the content of Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole in plasma and urine samples between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at 6 days.","timeFrame":"6 days"},{"measure":"Differences in Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at 7 days.","description":"Differences in the content of Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole in plasma and urine samples between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at 7 days.","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Differences in Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at 8 days.","description":"Differences in the content of Borneol, Muscone, 1,8-Cineole in plasma and urine samples between Xingnaojing injection group and standard care group at 8 days.","timeFrame":"8 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The change of neurological deficits","description":"The change of neurological deficits is measured by the change of National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, ranging from 0 (best score) to 42 (worst score).","timeFrame":"Baseline, 7 days"},{"measure":"Patient reported outcome","description":"Patient reported outcome is measured by Patient reported outcome (PRO) scale of stroke, ranging from 0(worst score) to 180 (best score).","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"The proportion of life dependency","description":"The proportion of life dependency is defined as Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2.
