The technique uses microcatheters to navigate to the draining veins of AVM, to reach and then fill the AVM nidus retrogradely with liquid embolic agents until the lesion is occluded. This technique has the potential to improve on some of the problems with the arterial approach to AVM embolization, such as a low overall occlusion rate. However, by occluding the vein first, and filling the lesion with the embolic agent in a retrograde fashion, the method transgresses a widely held dogma in the surgical or endovascular treatment of AVMs: to preserve the draining vein until all afferent vessels have been occluded. Nevertheless, the initial case series have shown promising results, with high occlusion rates, and few technical complications.\n\nThe method is increasingly used in an increasing number of centers, but there is currently no research protocol to guide the use of this promising but still experimental treatment in a prudent fashion. Care trials can be designed to offer such an experimental treatment, taking into account the best medical interests of patients, in the presence of rapidly evolving indications and techniques."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Arteriovenous Malformations, Cerebral","Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformation","Ruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformation"],"keywords":["brain arteriovenous malformation","Arteriovenous malformations","AVM","BAVM","stroke","intracranial hemorrhage","congenital abnormalities","aneurysm","vascular malformations","cardiovascular abnormalities","cardiovascular diseases","vascular diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"standard Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The standard TAE, without TVE, is used in patient allocated standard treatment.\n\nThe arterial approach will consist of at least one attempted catheterization for trans-arterial injection of liquid embolic.\n\nPatients incompletely treated at the time of the final embolization procedure are adjudicated a failure to reach the primary outcome and can be treated using alternative standard options (including surgery, radiation therapy, conservative management).
