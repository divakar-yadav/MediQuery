Hemorrhagic Infarction was a part of the natural progression after acute ischemic stroke. Previous study have shown no significant relationship between hemorrhagic Infarction and poor outcome in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. In this study, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of early antiplatelet therapy after hemorrhagic infarction in acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Antiplatelet Therapy","Hemorrhagic Infarction"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","intravenous thrombolysis","Hemorrhagic Infarction","antiplatelet therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":290,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early Antiplatelet Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Early aspirin Therapy"]},{"label":"Non-Early Antiplatelet Therapy","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Non-Early aspirin Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Early aspirin Therapy","description":"Early Antiplatelet Therapy is administered within 24 to 48 hours after stroke onset and the dose is determined by the clinician.
