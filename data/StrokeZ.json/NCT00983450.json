In addition, the physiotherapy treatments at the rehabilitation center, the study group will gain an intervention consisting of 12 therapy sessions, administered for 12 consecutive days (apart of weekends). The intervention will include 6 minutes of watching a movie clip alternately showing a healthy man and a healthy woman at their sixties, walking while being filmed from various angles. Immediately after watching, the subject will perform 6 minutes of walking, under the experimenters supervision, but without his or hers intervention. Immediately following the walking, the whole procedure will be repeated (watching a clip and walking).\n\nThe control group will undergo 12 treatments of the same nature, but will watch the movie clip shown backwards, so that the people filmed will seem to walk backwards (it was established that watching a reversed action does not activate the MNS system activated by a regular execution of the activity \\[Celnik et al., 2008\\]), followed by 6 minutes of walking under the experimenters supervision, then watching the movie again and walking again.\n\nThe person performing the examinations will be blinded as to the division of the subjects to the study group and the control group. After performing the previously noted examinations needed to participate in the research, the subjects found fit will be examined before the beginning of the intervention, at its end and then three months after its conclusion. The examinations will include smart step and walking parameters."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"People after a first ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, up to 60 days following the event.","interventionNames":["Other: watching a normal walking clip"]},{"label":"CONTROL","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"People after a first ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, up to 60 days following the event.","interventionNames":["Other: watching walk backward clip"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"watching a normal walking clip","description":"the study group will gain an intervention consisting of 12 therapy sessions, administered for 12 consecutive days (apart of weekends).
