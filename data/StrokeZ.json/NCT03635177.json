A group of stroke patients will be subjected to four weeks of daily remote ischemic conditioning and four weeks of placebo and vascular function is assessed as a primary outcome.","detailedDescription":"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIC) has been shown to reduce myocardial damage in association with a myocardial infarct but less is known about the potential effects on vascular function in patients who have suffered a stroke. RIC is a procedure by which blood flow to a limb is repeatedly occluded during a short period by an inflatable cuff. This project evaluates the effect of a two week period with RIC on vascular function and cerebral blood flow velocity as well as on factors associated with blood clot formation in patients who have suffered a stroke. The study also aims to provide mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of the RIC procedure.\n\nSubjects are patients who within the past five years have suffered from lacunar infarct. The study is of a cross-over design with two weeks of homebased RIC treatment and two weeks of control period in a randomized order. Before and after the experimental periods the subjects undergo a number of tests assessing general health status, vascular function and cerebral blood flow velocity. Skeletal muscle samples are obtained for the determination of selected proteins related to vascular function and angiogenesis and blood samples are obtained for the determination of platelet function.\n\n."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Lacunar"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"The patients will undergo two weeks of the intervention and two weeks of controlperiod, separated by three weeks.
