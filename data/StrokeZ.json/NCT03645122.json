Muscle weakness after stroke results from the abnormal interaction between cells in the brain that send commands to control movement and cells in the spinal cord that cause muscles to produce movement. The neuromodulation strategy central to this project has been shown the strengthen the physical connection between both cells, producing a change in movement potential of muscles weakened by stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States with 795,000 individuals suffering a new or recurrent stroke each year. In most cases, disability is associated with incomplete motor recovery of the paretic limb. Full recovery is often not achieved, creating a need for neuromodulation strategies that target the physiological mechanisms impaired by stroke to fully harness the adaptive capacity of the nervous system. The neuromodulation protocol that will be tested in these experiments will target connections between the brain and spinal cord with noninvasive stimulation to enhance movement potential of the hand. Individuals who experienced a single stroke at least 6 months ago may be eligible to participate."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Neuromodulation","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)","Electrical stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the region of the brain responsible for voluntary movement control and electrical stimulation to a peripheral nerve innervating hand muscles will be triggered at an interval that elicits action potentials arriving in a set sequence and predetermined delay in the spinal cord.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Physiology","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Different neural elements will be stimulated and evoked potentials will be recorded via electromyography.
