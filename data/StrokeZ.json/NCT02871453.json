A large proportion of stroke patients develop motor dysfunction in the early stage after stroke. Acupuncture is often used as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. Jiao's scalp acupuncture is a contemporary acupuncture technique integrating traditional Chinese needling methods with western medical knowledge of representative areas of the cerebral cortex. It has been widely applied to be a kind of effective treatment for stroke in China. But, there is meta-analysis suggests that with stroke rehabilitation, acupuncture has no additional effect on motor recovery but has a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo effect and varied study quality. The efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies.\n\nThe objective of this proposed study is to determine whether scalp acupuncture treatment could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke patients.\n\nIn this 8-week, assessor-blind, randomized, controlled study of scalp acupuncture as additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 116 patients with ischemic stroke patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to scalp acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment (n =58) or rehabilitation treatment (n =58). (40 sessions, 5 sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured using Fugl-Meyer Scale, Modified Barthel Index and SS-QOL scale. The study will be conducted at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University, Hua Shan Hospital."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Motor Dysfunction","Scalp Acupuncture"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":116,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acupuncture combined rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Scalp acupuncture treatment\n\nRehabilitation treatment","interventionNames":["Device: Scalp Acupuncture Treatment"]},{"label":"Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Rehabilitation treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Scalp Acupuncture Treatment","description":"The Motor Area of the scalp acupuncture is located over the anterior central convolution of the cerebral cortex, being a line starting from a point 0.5cm posterior to the midpoint of the anterior-posterior midline of the head and stretching diagonally to the juncture between the eyebrow-occipital line and the anterior border of the corner of temporal hairline is indistinct, draw a vertical line upward from the middle point of the zygomatic arch to the eyebrow-occipital line, the intersection of the two lines is the projection of the Motor Area.
