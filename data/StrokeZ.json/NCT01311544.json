However, the techniques usually used provide only static evaluation (degree of stenosis, occlusion) but not dynamic. An ultra-fast 3D MRA originally developed for the cardiac imaging, k-t blast (Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique) could be used to review the supraaortic vessels. This MRA offers the following advantages: short acquisition time, wide spatial coverage (of the thoracic aorta to the distal encephalic arteries), 3D spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. These qualities are even more optimal with a high magnetic field (3T). The high temporal resolution is interesting because it provides to repeat a volume every eight seconds and thus to have a dynamic evaluation of vascular filling and to assess the vascular supply of the infarcted territory. This sequence is classified as a 4D MRA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":92,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Images quality for each cervical and intracranial arteries","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quantification of carotid stenosis with NASCET classification","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Study of dynamic vascular consequences of carotid stenosis","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men and women over 18 years\n* Eligibility for intravenous thrombolytic treatment (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria)\n* Permanent ischemic stroke confirm with encephalic MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\n* Patient able of accepting protocol information\n* Patient who received information about the protocol and had not expressed its opposition to participate\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pacemaker\n* Surgical ferromagnetic clips\n* Cochlear implants\n* Intraocular metallic foreign body\n* Iron implants or objects likely to concentrate the Radio Frequency field\n* Claustrophobia\n* Known intolerance to contrast media (DOTAREM)\n* Pregnant women (Beta Human Chorionic gonadotrophin performed for biological assessment of thrombolysis)\n* Patient with severe kidney with Glomerular Filtration rate \\< 30 ml/min\n* Persons subject to major legal protection (safeguarding justice, guardianship, trusteeship), persons deprived of liberty","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"jean-yves gauvrit","affiliation":"Rennes University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rennes University Hospital","city":"Rennes","state":"Brittany","zip":"35033","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.11198,"lon":-1.67429}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
