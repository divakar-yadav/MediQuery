The intervention will consist of 8 20-minute tDCS sessions conducted over four weeks. The stimulation will be performed by applying the stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on the left side (F3) and the cathode will be at point O2 of the right hemisphere. The study will consist of two groups: the control group in which sham stimulation will be applied and therapeutic education and aerobic exercise; the intervention group in which stimulation, therapeutic education and therapeutic exercise will be carried out."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["tdcs","post stroke fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"* Therapeutic education about post-stroke fatigue\n* Sham stimulation with tDCS: Anode placed in F3 and cathode in O2, 20 minutes.\n* Aerobic exercise measured with Borg scale (moderate intensity)","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]},{"label":"Experimental group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"* Therapeutic education about post-stroke fatigue\n* Stimulation with tDCS: Anode placed in F3 and cathode in O2, intensity 2mA during 20 minutes.\n* Aerobic exercise measured with Borg scale (moderate intensity)","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"Non invasive brain stimulation with sham and active comparators","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental group"],"otherNames":["physical exercise","therapeutic education"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fatigue Assessment Scale","description":"The scale consists of 10 questions about the characteristics of fatigue in the current daily routine, which are rated on a five-point range from 1, \"never,\" to 5, \"always.\" Higher scores indicate more fatigue, with a cut-off point of ≥24 defining the presence of fatigue.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 month post intervention and 3 months post intervention.

It includes different areas: level of consciousness, eye movements, integrity of visual fields, facial movements, muscle strength, sensitivity, coordination, language and negligence. Each item is scored on an ordinal scale from 0 to 2, 0 to 3 or 0 to 4.

The scale is numerical and ranges from 0 to 6. 0: no symptoms; 1: without significant disability (the patient is able to carry out his/her usual activities and obligations); 2: mild disability; 3: moderate disability; 4: moderately severe disability; 5: severe disability (totally dependent patient); 6: death.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 month post intervention and 6 months post intervention.

There are two forms of output from scoring the IPAQ. Results can be reported in categories (low activity levels, moderate activity levels or high activity levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week). MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity. A MET is a multiple of your estimated resting energy expenditure. One MET is what you expend when you are at rest. Therefore 2 METS is twice what you expend at rest. To get a continuous variable score from the IPAQ (MET minutes a week) we will consider walking to be 3.3 METS, moderate physical activity to be 4 METS and vigorous physical activity to be 8 METS.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 month post intervention and 3 months post intervention.
