Investigators will study whether immediate statin treatment after the onset of stroke is beneficial on the neurological protection since most of previous studies with statins just showed the preventive effects from onset of primary or recurrent cerebral infarction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":270,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Atorvastatin 20 mg or Pitavastain 4 mg or Rosuvastatin 5 mg treatment initiated within 24 hours after admission","interventionNames":["Drug: Statin"]},{"label":"Stable Group","type":"OTHER","description":"Not start or withdraw Atorvastatin 20 mg or Pitavastain 4 mg or Rosuvastatin 5 mg treatment for a weak after admission.","interventionNames":["Drug: Statin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Statin","description":"Randomized controlled trial of early versus late statin therapy in patients with ischemic stroke","armGroupLabels":["Acute Group","Stable Group"],"otherNames":["Atorvastatin, Pitavastain, Rosuvastatin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale","description":"Scale range from 0 \\[no symptom\\] to 6 \\[dead\\]","timeFrame":"12 weeks from stroke onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* the Informed consent will be acquired by the document.\n* Age: 20 years of age or older.\n* Gender: unquestioned\n* hospitalization, outpatient: hospital\n* Patients by MRI at the time of hospital transport, it has been confirmed diagnosed with cerebral infarction\n* ingestible in within 24 hours after admission In the study treatment period, patients that can be defined treatment in this clinical study implementation plan\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the treatment agent of the present study\n* Patients acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis acute exacerbation, liver cirrhosis, it is believed that the liver cancer, liver function jaundice or the like is reduced, or a biliary obstruction\n* Patients suspected of being pregnant or pregnant\n* Patients in the administration of the cyclosporine or telaprevir\n* patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (SCr â‰§ 2.5mg / dL or eGFR \\<30mg / dL)\n* Patients who received a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months\n* valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, patients with atrial thrombus\n* Patients familial hypercholesterolemia\n* patient admission NIHSS score is greater than or equal to 3 is more than 20 or before the onset mRS score\n* patients with other doctors deemed inappropriate","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Shinichi Yoshimura","affiliation":"Hyogo collage of Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hyogo collage of Medicine","city":"Nishinomiya","state":"Hyogo","zip":"665-8501","country":"Japan","geoPoint":{"lat":34.71562,"lon":135.33199}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29030478","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Yoshimura S, Uchida K, Daimon T, Takashima R, Kimura K, Morimoto T; ASSORT Trial Investigator.
