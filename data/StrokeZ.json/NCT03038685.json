Main focuses are on patient-empowerment, shared-decision making and health literacy, as these items are linked with better therapeutic adherence and self-care for chronic diseases.\n\nIn case of a positive result, implementation of this individualized chronic stroke care program executed by a personal stroke coach, initiated during hospitalization and using a web-based intervention program, can easily be unrolled in other Belgian stroke units. The program can be cost-effective if better clinical outcome, stroke recurrence rates, number of in-hospital consultations, number of rehospitalisations are reduced. This will be evaluated in a in-depth healt-economic analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Secondary prevention","Web-based intervention","Strokecoach"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"A pilot, double-arm, pre/post study design with compirason between historical, monocenter cohort (Sint-Janhospital, 2011) and prospective, multicenter cohort (4 Belgian Stroke centers, 2017)","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":148,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"prospective, multicenter cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A group of 175 patients will be recruited in 4 Belgian stroke centers during the six months period.

Tips and tricks to deal with lifestyle modification will be delivered on regular basis. Meanwhile, patients will be asked to complete on a pre-specified frequency their data regarding their cardiovascular risk profile. Additionally, participants will be contacted at 0.5-1-2 and 6 months by phone calls or videoconsultancy.
