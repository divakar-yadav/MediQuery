Mechanical ventilation will be standardized according to current international recommendations (tidal volume between 6 mL.kg-1 and 8 mL.kg-1 of theoretical ideal weight (TIP) for patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS); PEEP equal to 6 cmH2O). Hemodynamic and ventilatory data will be collected (baseline).\n\nThe successive realization of the two ARM will then be carried out with collection of the hemodynamic and ventilatory data during the last 10 seconds of each ARM. Between each ARM, conventional ventilation will be resumed for 10 minutes in order to observe a wash-out period, and to allow a return to the baseline state. Data will also be collected as before.\n\nAfter these measurements have been taken, all management will be left to the discretion of the practitioner caring for the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Output","Hemodynamic Optimization","Monitoring Blood Pressure","Stroke Volume","Mechanical Ventilation","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) then extended sigh","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients assigned to this group will receive a CPAP ARM (40cmH2O during 50 seconds), followed by a 10-minute pause corresponding to a period of return to basal state.\n\nThen an ARM by extended sigh (e-sigh) also 50 seconds (driving pressure at 10cmH2O and successive PEEP levels at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30cmH2O, with respiratory frequency fixed at 30/min in controlled pressure).\n\nHemodynamic (blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume) and ventilatory measurements will be performed the last 10 seconds of each recruitment maneuver.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Alveolar Recruitment Maneuver (ARM)"]},{"label":"extended sigh then continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients assigned to this group will receive an ARM by extended sigh (e-sigh) during 50 seconds (driving pressure at 10cmH2O and successive PEEP levels at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30cmH2O, with respiratory frequency fixed at 30/min in controlled pressure), followed by a 10-minute pause corresponding to a period of return to basal state.\n\nThen they receive a CPAP ARM (40cmH2O during 50 seconds).
