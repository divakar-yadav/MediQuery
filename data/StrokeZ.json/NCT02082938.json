We conducted a quasi-experimental \"before and after\" study with twelve hemiparetic adult patients who had genu recurvatum in the gait. The plantar pressure peaks were compared at the various moments of the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Nos Without Residual Deficits"],"keywords":["stroke,","rehabilitation,","hemiparesis,","gait training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bracing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Bracing: the patients began four weeks of training the gait with the brace, under the guidance and observation of the physiotherapist belonging to the group of authors of this study.","interventionNames":["Device: Bracing"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Bracing","description":"Twice a week, for a period of 5 weeks, before the sessions in the physiotherapy clinic the patients participating in the study were asked to walk at a self-selected speed on flat ground along a corridor 50 meters long, with the brace being used for fifteen minutes of gait retraining of the affected side.","armGroupLabels":["Bracing"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"distribution of plantar pressures during walking","description":"To evaluate the distribution of plantar pressures during walking, for individuals with hemiparesis, before and after training with a brace for gait retraining and control of genu recurvatum.\n\nTo observe the gait evolution of 12 patientes after the trainnig with a orthotic device.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* the presence of hemiparesis after the stroke, with an evolution time of between 6 and 24 months, the ability to walk without using assistive aids, and the presence of genu recurvatum during the mid-stance in the gait.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* conditions that would preclude evaluation and training with the brace; for example, the presence of contractures or fixed deformities in the lower limbs, and moderate to severe impairments related to cognition, perception, attention, or language","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Éder K Cardoso, Master","affiliation":"Federal University of Health Science of Porto Alegre","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke Nos","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
