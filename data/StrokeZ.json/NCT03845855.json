Half of participants will attend virtual reality treatment in addition to robotic gait therapy for 12 sessions, while the other half will attend only robotic gait therapy for 12 sessions.","detailedDescription":"Following stroke, motor disorders, balance disorders, falls, gait disturbances and cognitive disorders are frequently seen. In stroke rehabilitation, with the use of robots and virtual reality systems with conventional methods, it is aimed to increase patient's motivation, to check if exercise is effective, to provide objective evaluation data and to support the motor learning process and the use of these methods in the field of neurological rehabilitation is increasing.\n\nMulti-task evaluations can be made with the virtual environments created by virtual reality applications and complex tasks.\n\nThe traditional approach to stroke rehabilitation is mainly focused on balance and gait training under single task conditions. In everyday life, people should not only have balance and mobility skills, but also have the ability to perform other cognitive and motor tasks with these skills. Therefore, traditional approaches are not sufficient for the individual to return to society after a stroke.\n\nIn this respect, this study was planned in order to examine the effects of frequently used virtual reality treatment in addition to robotic gait therapy on the dual task, balance and gait performance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["virtual reality","stroke","dual task"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual reality with robotic gait","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"virtual reality treatment with robotic gait therapy 2 times for week by 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: virtual reality","Other: robotic gait"]},{"label":"Robotic gait therapy only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"only robotic gait therapy 2 times for week by 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: robotic gait"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"virtual reality","description":"Virtual reality with a game","armGroupLabels":["Virtual reality with robotic gait"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"robotic gait","description":"robotic gait therapy","armGroupLabels":["Robotic gait therapy only","Virtual reality with robotic gait"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meter walk test","description":"The time is measured after 10 meter walk completed","timeFrame":"change from baseline time at the end of 6 week"},{"measure":"10 meter walk test with cognitive task","description":"The time is measured after 10 meter walk with a cognitive task completed","timeFrame":"change from baseline time at the end of 6 week"},{"measure":"10 meter walk test with motor task","description":"The time is measured after 10 meter walk with a motor task completed","timeFrame":"change from baseline time at the end of 6 week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mini Mental State Examination","description":"Mini Mental State Examination can be used to assess the mental status. Mini Mental State Examination is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30. The minimum score is 0. Getting 24 point is cut point. If a person get 24 points from examination, his/her mental status is fine. The higher scores represent better mental status.","timeFrame":"change from baseline score at the end of 6 week"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Classification","description":"This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. Level 0 is the minimum level and level 5 is the maximum level. Higher levels represent better function.","timeFrame":"change from baseline score at the end of 6 week"},{"measure":"Rivermead Mobility Index","description":"Rivermead Mobility Index assesses functional mobility in gait, balance and transfers after stroke. 14-self-reported items and 1 direct observation item are calculated. Items are coded as either 0 or 1, depending on whether the patient can complete the task according to specific instructions. Items receive a score of 0 for a \"No\" response and 1 for a \"Yes\" response.A maximum of 15 points is possible; higher scores indicate better mobility performance.","timeFrame":"change from baseline score at the end of 6 week"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks.
