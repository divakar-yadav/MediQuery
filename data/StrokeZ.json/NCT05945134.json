Inter-muscular coordination impairment caused altered muscle contraction sequences and weight-bearing asymmetry during functional activities. Sit-to-stand (STS) training is often used to improve functional activities among post-stroke subjects. However, the improvement may come from compensatory movements. Using compensatory movement may cause muscle weakness in the affected side and increase fall risk. This study will develop a novel STS training system with interactive visual and audio feedback emphasizing weight transferring and weight bearing. The present study aims to investigate the effects of sit-to-stand training with interactive visual and audio feedback on muscle contraction sequences and weight bearing symmetry in individuals with chronic stroke.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective randomized single-blinded controlled trial with pre- and post-measurements. 20 individuals will be recruited, and randomly assigned to experimental or control group. Statistical data analysis will be done by SPSS 24.0. Baseline characteristics will be analyzed using independent t-test or Chi-square test. Repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc analysis will be used for time-by-group comparisons. The significant level is set at 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Interactive feedback","Muscle contraction sequence","Weight bearing symmetry","Sit-to-stand training","Chronic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Visual and auditory feedback STS training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The interactive interface of visual and auditory feedback system was designed using LabVIEW and integrated force plates for training.

It allows the participants to adjust and relearn the correct weight shifting and symmetry.\n\nThe intensity will be adjusted based on different chair heights (e.g. 115%, 100%, 80% of lower leg length), various seat materials, and supported level of thigh (progressing from one-third of the length between the greater trochanter of the femur and the knee joint line to full support).
