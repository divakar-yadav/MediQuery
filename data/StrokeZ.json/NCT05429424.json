Improvements in dysphagia and subsequent complications in patients should be effective in reducing hospital stays and improving the quality of long-term care. In view of clinical medical needs and policy trends, this study aims to explore the efficacy of using traditional Chinese medicine to treat cerebral apoplexy sequelae in Taiwan. It is expected that through (1) exploration of real-world data analysis, combined with the advantages of Taiwan's biomedical database, data exploration will be carried out to provide big data (2) Multi-center prospective randomized clinical trials, providing clinical evidence of the highest level of evidence in empirical medicine."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["acupuncture","swallowing impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"In this study, the participants, assessor, and statistician are all blinded to the treatment assignments except for the acupuncturist and study coordinator.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":336,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Verum acupuncture group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The study uses manual acupuncture as verum intervention.","interventionNames":["Other: Verum acupuncture group"]},{"label":"Sham control group I","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The study used specific made needle with a blunt tip, Streitberger device, as sham intervention.","interventionNames":["Other: Sham control group I"]},{"label":"Sham control group II","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Manual acupuncture at the points unrelated to the dysphagia is another sham intervention in this study.","interventionNames":["Other: Sham control group II"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Verum acupuncture group","description":"The acupuncturist disinfected the skin of the selected acupoints with alcohol, then vertically penetrated the skin with disposable stainless-steel needles (size, brand, Taiwan) to the depth predetermined for each point (between 8-25 mm, depending on the location of the acupoint) and achieved a \"deqi\" response, often described as a pressure, fullness, or achiness feeling around the acupoints.","armGroupLabels":["Verum acupuncture group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham control group I","description":"The needle does not penetrate the skin and retract in the handle while the acupuncturist needling into the skin.
