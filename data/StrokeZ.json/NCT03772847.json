Platelet activating factor (PAF) strong platelet aggregation may be involved in thrombosis. Formation process. The main components of Ginkgolide injection (Ginkgo) are ginkgolide, ginkgolides A, ginkgolides B and ginkgolides C. Ginkgo biloba lactone can antagonize PAF and has strong anti-platelet aggregation. . Therefore, it can be speculated that ginkgolides injection combined with alteplase intravenous thrombolysis may improve the recanalization rate after thrombolysis and reduce the reocclusion rate.\n\nIn addition, clinical studies have also found that ginkgolide injection has a good auxiliary effect on hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, which can regulate inflammatory factors such as IL-6, TNF-α and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients. Recovery of neurological function in patients. It is well known that TNF-α, IL-β, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, etc. are all inflammatory factors associated with reperfusion injury. Therefore, we speculate that ginkgolides injection may also regulate inflammatory factors associated with reperfusion injury, such as IL-6, TNF-α, thereby reducing reperfusion injury, thereby improving patient prognosis.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy of ginkgolides injection combined with alteplase in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and to improve the prognosis of patients with thrombolysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intravenous Alteplase Thrombolysis","Neurological Improving"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1189,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ginkgolide group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ginkgolide plus alteplase","interventionNames":["Drug: ginkgolide"]},{"label":"control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"alteplase"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ginkgolide","description":"ginkgolide plus alteplase","armGroupLabels":["ginkgolide group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"proportion of patients with a 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score below 2","description":"mRS 0-6, higher indicate worse outcome","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) scores between the two groups at baseline, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days","description":"NIHSS 0-42, and higher indicate worse outcome","timeFrame":"14 days"},{"measure":"recurrence rate of cerebrovascular disease in 1-month and 3-month follow-up","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"incidence of compound events (include cerebrovascular events,myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and systemic embolism）","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
