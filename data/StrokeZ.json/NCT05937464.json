FIM consists of 18 questions and basically measures 2 parameters: 1) physical/motor function, 2) cognitive/cognitive function. Each item is scored at 7 levels (1-7), with 'level 1' representing full dependance and 'level 7' completely independence. The FIM total score is between 18-126 points. The higher the score an individual gets, the higher the level of independence means. FIM is the most preferred and used activity scale in the field of rehabilitation.","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"30-Second chair stand test","description":"The physical functionality of the participants was assessed with the 30-Second chair stand test.18 The 30-second chair stand test (30-CST) is a measure of lower body strength and endurance. Participants were asked to sit in a standard-height chair (with a seat height of 43 cm) with arms crossed over the chest, then stand fully and sit down again as many times as possible within 30 s. In order to decrease the effect of learning, all tests began with three to five practices.","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"6- Minute walk test","description":"The functional capacities of the participants were evaluated with the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), which can determine the functional capacity of individuals with a single measurement in neurological diseases.19 In the study, a 30 m long straight line was divided into 3 m intervals and the total distance walked at the end of 6 minutes was calculated. Rest period of 10 minutes was given before the test. The importance of the distance to be walked was emphasized to the individuals participating in the study and they were asked to walk as fast as they could without running. At the end of the test, the distance that the individuals could walk was recorded in meters (m).","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"36-Item Short Form Health Survey","description":"The quality of life of the participants was evaluated with the Turkish version of the Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scale.20 SF-36 is a 36-item self-assessment scale consisting of eight sub-parameters. This scale consists of Physical functioning, Role limitations: Physical/Emotional, Social functioning, Mental health, Vitality, General health perception sub-parameters. Each subscale is scored between 0-100. An increase in the score indicates an improvement in the quality of life.","timeFrame":"At baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age between18-65 years old\n* Patients who had a stroke at least three months ago\n* Can independently ambulated\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Heart failure and rhythm disorder,\n* Visual and cognitive problems,\n* Neglect phenomenon (Neglect Syndrome),\n* Cerebellar pathology,\n* Any lower extremity surgery\n* An additional neurological pathology that could prevent receiving a training program","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Private rehabilitation center in Istanbul","city":"Istanbul","state":"Antalya","zip":"07190","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":41.01384,"lon":28.94966}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
