The apparatus comprises a combination of several magnets enclosed in a supportive cover. The magnets are placed in a proper position and their polarity can be changed at any time without any difficulty.\n\nThe device provides a source of stimulation for the nerve to achieve therapeutic results and rehabilitation of patients with spinal trauma or stroke.\n\nA spinal cord injury - damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves at the end of the spinal canal - often causes permanent changes in strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of the injury.\n\nMany scientists are optimistic that advances in research will someday make the repair of spinal cord injuries possible. Research studies are ongoing around the world. In the meantime, treatments and rehabilitation allow many people with a spinal cord injury to lead productive, independent lives.\n\nThe effects of SCI depend on the type of injury and the level of the injury. SCI can be divided into two types of injury - complete and incomplete.\n\nComplete: A complete injury means that there is no function below the level of the injury; no sensation and no voluntary movement. Both sides of the body are equally affected.\n\nIncomplete: An incomplete injury means that there is some functioning below the primary level of the injury. A person with an incomplete injury may be able to move one limb more than another, may be able to feel parts of the body that cannot be moved, or may have more functioning on one side of the body than the other. With the advances in acute treatment of SCI, incomplete injuries are becoming more common.\n\nSpinal Magnetic Stimulation (SMS) is a relatively new way to use magnetism to affect the spinal cord. It is non-invasive, meaning that the procedure does not require any type of surgery; rather, it is conducted by transmitting magnetic pulses through the Spinal Cord by pressing a machine against the back.\n\nThe Long term goal of this research project is the implementation of an effective, inexpensive therapy in patients with spinal cord injury. Another objective is the development of a cheap, presentable and comfortable magnetic device that causes neural stimulation to stop and reversing the signs and symptoms of Spinal Cord injury.\n\nThe short-term objective is to prove that magneto stimulation is an intervention that reverses the signs and symptoms of Spinal Cord injury in an early and moderate State"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["SCI, Spinal Cord Injury, Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Spinal Magnetic Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Spinal Magnetic Stimulation (SMS) is a relatively new way to use magnetism to affect the spinal cord.
