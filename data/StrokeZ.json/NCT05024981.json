The resulting deficits are numerous and lead in particular to an alteration in the quality of walking and autonomy. Numerous rehabilitation techniques have been described. In practice, correction instructions are often given by the therapist while the motor activity is being performed. Walking is a complex activity, as is the processing of dual-task information in elderly stroke patients. It therefore appears interesting to separate the time of motor realization and that of correction instructions. Investigators therefore propose firstly to film the patient during the performance of a walking activity and then, secondly, to analyse the video with the patient, which thus represents a source of delayed feedback. The main objective of the study is to observe the effects of this practice on walking speed. Investigators are comparing two groups of patients: the control group receiving conventional rehabilitation and the experimental group receiving conventional rehabilitation plus sessions with the video tool. They expect to observe a greater improvement in walking speed in the experimental group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Classic reeducation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Classic reeducation"]},{"label":"Classic reeducation + videographic feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Videographic feedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Videographic feedback","description":"Twice a week during his classic re-education sessions, the patient will be filmed for 1 minute.
