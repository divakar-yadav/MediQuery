All subjects will be divided into an intelligent group and a doctor group according to a 1:1 ratio. The intelligent group will undergo intelligent system evaluation, and the doctor group will undergo the clinician's conventional treatment process. At the same time, all the subjects will undergo gold-standard panel gait and cognitive rating scale assessments.","detailedDescription":"All subjects in the intelligent group will undergo tests to evaluate their nervous system function, including the timed up-and-go test, mini-cognitive assessment, and sentence repetition. Subjects will be recorded using a camera and microphone. The intelligent system uses the built-in intelligent algorithm to analyze the gait video, sound, and picture to provide information on gait features (stand-up time, turnaround time, stride length, step velocity, stride length, step width, etc.), language features (pronunciation, intonation, word order, language accuracy, language fluency, etc.), and clock features (contour, numbers, pointers, etc.).\n\nAll subjects in the doctor group will consult with a doctor in the non-intelligent group according to the routine treatment procedure. Doctors in the non-intelligent group are required to be internal medicine clinicians with intermediate title or below, and they should have registered their qualifications, relevant knowledge and training experience, educational background, and other information in the early stage of the study. The doctors in the non-intelligent group will make clinical diagnoses for the subjects based on routine medical operations such as a history of the present illness, previous history, and physical examination, and the data in medical records in the outpatient department will help determine whether the subjects have gait disorders.\n\nAll subjects' walking videos will be assessed by the gold-standard panel, which will consist of 2 experts of movement disorders. If there is any difference, a third expert will be included in the evaluation. According to the clinical experience, the expert doctors will evaluate the subjects' gait, and the results will be divided into normal gait and abnormal gait."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Silent Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intelligent","type":"OTHER","description":"receive the neurological function assessment by artificial intelligence","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: intelligent assessment"]},{"label":"manual","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"receive the neurological function assessment by doctor"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"intelligent assessment","description":"intelligent neurological function assessment","armGroupLabels":["intelligent"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sensitivity","description":"Compared with the gold standard panel of neurology, the sensitivity of the intelligent system and clinicians to screen for gait disorders","timeFrame":"baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Specificity","description":"the specificity of the intelligent system and clinicians to screen for gait disorders","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Coincidence","description":"the coincidence of the intelligent system and clinicians to screen for gait disorders","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Yoden index","description":"the Yoden index of the intelligent system and clinicians to screen for gait disorders","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Positive predictive value and negative predictive value","description":"the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the intelligent system and clinicians at different levels to screen for gait disorders","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Cost and cost-effectiveness","description":"Health care utilization and costs will be collected to calculate direct and indirect costs of the intelligent system and clinicians to screen for gait disorders, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be computed.","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
