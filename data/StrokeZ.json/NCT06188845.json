Kinesio Taping (KT) has been used to help stroke patients improve their balance and ambulation. Few studies explored the effects of KT on fine motor function in stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hand function performance of high-functioning stroke survivors after KT. Participants were divided into two groups: KT group and control group. Last two days, the KT group received KT intervention. After the taping was removed, baseline and post-test evaluation were conducted. Outcome measures included muscle strength, range of motion (ROM), spasticity, fine motor function, and self-reported upper limb disability. The results revealed that the KT group had less spasticity, increasing ROM trend, and improved fine motor function and disability. KT improved spasticity, active movement, and muscle flexibility, resulting in more skilled and delicate hand function in chronic high-functioning stroke survivors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cardiovascular Diseases","Physical Disability"],"keywords":["kinesio tape","high-functioning stroke","hand function","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"KT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the KT group were applied I-shaped Kinesio tape to the wrist extensor and pronator teres of the hemiplegic forearm for 2 days.
