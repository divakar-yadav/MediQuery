The first phone call will be scheduled to occur within one week of the consent and baseline assessments. A minimum of one social phone call will occur each week for 6weeks. Each phone call is expected to last around 1 hour with flexibility to be shorter or longer. The calls will be unstructured and designed simply to engage in conversation with the participant. The length of the phone calls, days and times will be recorded by the volunteer along with a short journal entry describing the conversation topics and any information that stood out to the volunteer. If the stroke survivor and student volunteer wish to speak more than the designated one call a week, that will be allowed if both parties agree. The same student volunteer will conduct all six sessions","armGroupLabels":["Treatment group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of participants who enrolled in the study","timeFrame":"post intervention (6 weeks from start of intervention)"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of participants who completed all 6 phone calls","timeFrame":"post intervention (6 weeks from start of intervention)"},{"measure":"Feasibility as assessed by the number of participants who completed all the assessments","timeFrame":"post intervention (6 weeks from start of intervention)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in loneliness as assessed by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale","description":"This is a 20 item questionnaire, each one is scored form 1(never) to 4(always).
