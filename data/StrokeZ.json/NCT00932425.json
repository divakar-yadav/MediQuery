Patients with stroke routinely undergo 24 hours of continuous cardiac telemetry during hospitalization for stroke as a means of excluding AF. Small studies indicate that extending the duration of monitoring with portable outpatient telemetry devices detects more cases of AF. However, these studies are small and lack control groups, and cannot demonstrate that prolonged cardiac monitoring detects more cases of AF than routine clinical follow-up. The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of randomizing patients to prolonged cardiac monitoring or routine clinical follow-up. The investigators will enroll 40 consecutive adult patients seen at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) Neurovascular service with cryptogenic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score 4 or greater). Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. Group A will be assigned to wear an ambulatory cardiac event monitor for 21 days. Group B will be discharged home without a monitor and will serve as controls during routine clinical follow-up. The investigators' primary outcome will be feasibility, defined as more than 80% of randomized patients completing full clinical follow-up and more than 70% of cardiac monitoring if applicable. The investigators' secondary outcomes will be diagnoses of AF at 90 days and 1 year and diagnoses of recurrent stroke at 1 year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cryptogenic","Cardioembolic","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Outpatient cardiac monitoring","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be assigned to wear a portable outpatient cardiac telemetry device for 21 days","interventionNames":["Device: Cardionet Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT)"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients will be discharged home with standard clinical follow-up"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Cardionet Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT)","description":"Patients will be assigned to wear the telemetry device for 21 days","armGroupLabels":["Outpatient cardiac monitoring"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Completion of Clinical Follow-up as a Measure of Feasibility","description":"Feasibility was defined as 90% or more of randomized patients completing full clinical follow-up and 70% or more completion of assigned cardiac monitoring if applicable","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Completion of Assigned Monitoring as a Measure of Feasibility","description":"Feasibility criteria included more than 70% completion of cardiac monitoring if applicable.
