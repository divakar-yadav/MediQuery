Investigators examined young, healthy, males who regularly participated in aerobic exercise.\n\nInvestigators first measured participant's response to exercise in hypoxia (simulated \\~7,500 feet above sea level). The investigators then had participants either 1) undergo 1 bout of high intensity interval exercise or 2) undergo 1 bout of moderate, continuous exercise.\n\n48 hours after the exercise, participants were again examined in hypoxia.","detailedDescription":"A crossover design was utilized to assess the effects of exercise-induced plasma volume expansion on cycling performance in hypoxia. All participants completed a high intensity (HI) bout and control (CON) intervention in a counterbalanced order. The HI bout consisted of 8x4min cycling bouts at 85% of VO2peak with 4 min rest between intervals. CON consisted of cycling at 50% VO2peak. Two 15 km, self-paced cycling time trials (TT) were performed before and after each training intervention. The first TT occurred 5 days before the training intervention (HI or CON) and the second TT occurred 48 hours post intervention. Interventions were separated by 14 days to ensure sufficient washout of any training effect as data have suggested retention of expanded plasma volume may last for 7-14 days. During washout, participants were instructed to continue their normal exercise routine.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that a single HI session would increase plasma volume and attenuate cardiovascular strain during exercise in hypoxia, as evidenced by reductions in HR and elevations in SV and Q. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesized that these changes would contribute to a reduced time-to-completion in a 15 km, self-paced cycling TT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Output","Stroke Volume"],"keywords":["Hypervolemia","high intensity exercise","altitude exposure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Intensity Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vigorous cycling","interventionNames":["Procedure: High Intensity Intervals"]},{"label":"Continuous Moderate Exercise","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Leisurely cycling","interventionNames":["Procedure: Moderate Exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"High Intensity Intervals","description":"8x4 min cycling bouts at 85% of VO2peak","armGroupLabels":["High Intensity Exercise"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Moderate Exercise","description":"81 minutes of cycling at 50% VO2peak","armGroupLabels":["Continuous Moderate Exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hemoglobin Concentration","description":"measured through spectroscopy","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Hematocrit Concentration","description":"measured through hematocrit reader","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time Trial Time","description":"Time to complete 15 km","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Cardiac Output","description":"measured via impedance cardiography","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Males age 18-38\n* Exercise at least 3 times/week for at least 30 minutes/day for the past 3 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Frequent hot bath or sauna users\n* Resided at altitude greater than 2,500 meters for \\>14 days.\n* Cardiovascular or metabolic disease","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"38 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"California Baptist University","city":"Riverside","state":"California","zip":"92504-3206","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":33.95335,"lon":-117.39616}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"6065055","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Alexander JK, Hartley LH, Modelski M, Grover RF.
