The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of mechanical embolectomy with the CE MARK approved stentriever Solitaire FR® versus medical management alone. Randomization will be done under a minimization process using age, baseline NIHSS, therapeutic window and vessel occlusion site. For the primary endpoint, subjects will be followed for 90 days post-randomization.\n\nInterim analysis will be performed as preplanned and interpreted by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after the first 174, 346 and 518 patients representing 25%, 50% and 75% of the planned sample size have completed their 90-day follow-up. The DSMB will advise the executive committee (EC) on recommendations to stop the trial early either for reasons of safety, efficacy, futility or to adjust the sample size. The latter may be necessary as given the paucity of data regarding natural history of the non-treated patients assumptions regarding rates of favorable outcomes in this group of patients may be incorrect. Of note, sample size adjustment based on different than expected outcomes rates is permitted, but it is not permitted to adjust the sample size based on change in the pre-specified treatment effect which is set at 10%.\n\nSubject population: Subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours from symptom onset and whose strokes are attributable to an occlusion of the internal carotid or proximal MCA (M1) arteries. Subjects are either ineligible for IV alteplase or have received IV alteplase therapy without recanalization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","endovascular treatment","clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":206,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical embolectomy with Solitaire FR device","interventionNames":["Device: Solitaire FR device"]},{"label":"Medical treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Medical treatment (standard of care in acute ischemic stroke)including intravenous thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Other: Medical treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Solitaire FR device","description":"Mechanical embolectomy in anterior large vessel occlusion","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular treatment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Medical treatment","description":"Standard of care in acute ischemic stroke including intravenous rTPA","armGroupLabels":["Medical treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Between-group comparison of the distribution of the modified Rankin Scale scores (shift analysis)","description":"evaluated by two separate assessors who are blinded to treatment","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"},{"measure":"Symptomatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage","description":"Deterioration in NIHSS score of ≥4 points within 24 hours from treatment and evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage type 2 in the 22 to 36 hours follow-up imaging scans evaluated by independent CT/MR Core Lab and Clinical Events Committee","timeFrame":"24h (-2/+12 hours) after enrollment"},{"measure":"Infarct Volume","description":"Infarct volume evaluated in a second neuroimaging after treatment evaluated by independent CT/MR Core Lab","timeFrame":"24h (-2/+12h) post treatment"},{"measure":"Vessel recanalization","description":"Vessel recanalization evaluated by CT angiography or MRA at 24 hours in both treatment groups evaluated by independent CT/MR Core Lab","timeFrame":"24h post treatment"},{"measure":"Intraprocedural related complications in endovascular arm","description":"Procedural related complications in the endovascular treatment arm: arterial perforation, arterial dissection, and embolization in a previously uninvolved vascular territory evaluated by the Angiography Core Lab and the Clinical Events Committee","timeFrame":"During endovascular treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.
