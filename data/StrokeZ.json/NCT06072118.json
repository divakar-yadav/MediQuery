Adrenomedullin, a vasoactive peptide, has angiogenic, vasodilation, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties and could have triple sites of action on components of the neuro-glial-vascular unit consisting of vessels, microglia and oligodendrocytes or, more specifically, on the white matter oligovascular unit. The aim of the AMCAD trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of Adrenomedullin in CADASIL patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cadasil"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adrenomedullin group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Adrenomedullin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Adrenomedullin","description":"Dosing at 15 ng/kg/min for 8 hours is continued for 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Adrenomedullin group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow change rate evaluated by arterial spin labeling","description":"Frontal lobe","timeFrame":"at 28 days post adrenomedullin administration"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow change rate evaluated by arterial spin labeling","description":"Frontal lobe","timeFrame":"at 8 hours / 15 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow change rate evaluated by arterial spin labeling","description":"Whole brain mean and each area","timeFrame":"at 8 hours / 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Mean diffusivity change rate of the white matter evaluated by MR diffusion tensor imaging","description":"Whole brain mean and each area","timeFrame":"at 8 hours / 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Fractional anisotropy change rate of the white matter evaluated by MR diffusion tensor imaging","description":"Whole brain mean and each area","timeFrame":"at 8 hours / 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Change in times of Trail making test-A/B from baseline evaluation","timeFrame":"at 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Change in scores of Montreal cognitive assessment from baseline evaluation","timeFrame":"at 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Change in scores of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth edition from baseline evaluation","timeFrame":"at 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Occurence of cerebral infarction","timeFrame":"at 8 hours / 15 days / 28 days / 90 days / 180 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Cerebral blood flow change rate evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography","description":"Frontal lobe","timeFrame":"at 28 days post adrenomedullin administration"},{"measure":"Safety: Serious adverse event","timeFrame":"From the initiation of adrenomedullin administration to 28 days post"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
