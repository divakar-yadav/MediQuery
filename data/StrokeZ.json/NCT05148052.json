The virtual reality exergame is designed to maximize the movement of upper extremities, primary to the shoulder and elbow. Thirty-six chronic stroke patient will receive conventional occupational treatment and virtual reality exergame in random order with a two-week-washout period. Outcome measures will be evaluated within two days before and after each treatment, conventional treatment and virtual reality exergame."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Virtual reality","Upper Extremity Paresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional therapy first","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group receiving conventional occupational therapy first and then virtual reality exergames.","interventionNames":["Device: Virtual reality exergames","Behavioral: Conventional occupational therapy"]},{"label":"Virtual reality first","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group receiving virtual reality exergames with virtual reality first and then conventional occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Virtual reality exergames","Behavioral: Conventional occupational therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Virtual reality exergames","description":"Twelve sessions of virtual reality exergames involving upper extremities will be conducted.
