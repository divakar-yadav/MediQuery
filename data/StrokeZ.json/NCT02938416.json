It can be performed in an eccentric or concentric way in a controlled manner, and is evidenced to be an effective and safe training method in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, burn injury, ankle instability, osteoarthritic knee, and chronic stroke in the past literatures.","armGroupLabels":["Isokinetic training"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Isotonic strengthening exercise","description":"Isotonic strengthening exercise keeps the tension remained unchanged during the muscle's length changing. As the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes. There are two types of isotonic contractions: (1) concentric and (2) eccentric. In a concentric contraction, the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance, then remains the same as the muscle shortens. In eccentric, the muscle lengthens due to the resistance being greater than the force the muscle is producing.","armGroupLabels":["Isotonic training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"isometric strengthening exercise","description":"home exercise education on isometric quadriceps strengthening on the day of out-patient appointment","armGroupLabels":["isometric training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Peak torque","description":"Isometric peak torque of hip/knee at 90 degree of flexion, peak torque of hip/knee at angular velocity of 60 degree/s and 120 degree/s","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed Up and Go test","description":"stand up from a chair, walk for 3 meters and go back and sit down","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire","description":"Use the 36-item, patient-reported questionnaire to survey the self-perceived health status","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Oxford Hip/Knee Score","description":"symptoms score during daily activities","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"The plasma concentration of hsCRP, and the level of substance P in saliva","description":"check by drawing blood and test","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* within one month of acute stroke\n* receive total hip/knee replacement within two to four weeks before\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* cannot perform from sitting to standing\n* Body Mass Index \\> 30\n* Lower limbs fracture history\n* Diabetic polyneuropathy\n* Cardiopulmonary diseases that impede exercise prescription\n* Impaired cognitive function\n* Infectious disease during the study period that may cause cytokine changes","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yuan-Yang Cheng, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886-4-23592525","phoneExt":"3500","email":"rifampin@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yuan-Yang Cheng, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taichung City","zip":"40705","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Yuan-Yang Cheng, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886423592525","phoneExt":"3533","email":"rifampin@gmail.com"},{"name":"Yuan-Yang Cheng, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":24.1469,"lon":120.6839}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35757239","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Cheng YY, Liu CC, Lin SY, Lee CH, Chang ST, Wang SP.
