During the appointment the purpose of the study will be explained and doubts will be clarified. All participants, whether accept or not, will receive the consultation that is normally provided to these patients and the information will be recorded in the medical record. If the subject does not accept, after the consultation, the appropriate management for the condition will be prescribed and a subsequent appointment will be made with another corresponding doctor to continue with the control.\n\nIf the subject agrees to participate, a clinical summary will be prepared, which will include demographic data, employment situation, the need for temporary disability for work and clinical data for the research file. The signature of the informed consent letter will also be requested. This physician 1 will assign the therapeutic modality using a table of random numbers to: Group 1. Therapy supported by virtual reality; Group 2. Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy; o Group 3. Usual physical and occupational therapy. The activities corresponding to each group will be carried out during 2 sessions a week, of 1 hour each session, for 6 weeks.\n\nAn appointment will be made to be assessed by the second rehabilitation specialist (evaluator 2), who will remain blind to the treatment, and will measure the functionality of the thoracic and pelvic limbs with the different scales (Fugl-Meyer, Motor Index and Fine Clamp Test), including muscle tone, trophism, arcs of mobility, functionality of the limbs, as well as of the hand, coordination, balance and sensory aspects. These scales will be applied before (initial assessment -A.I.-), during (intermediate assessment -Int.A.- week 3, session 6) and after (final assessment -F.A. - week 6, session 12) of the different rehabilitation programs. During the same times, the Boston Aphasia Intensity scale and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory will be applied by a neuropsychologist blinded to the treatment, for the evaluation of language and satisfaction, respectively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae"],"keywords":["Constraint-induced movement therapy","Hemiparesis","Neurorehabilitation","Satisfaction","Stroke","Virtual Reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Clinical Trial Randomized Single Blind","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The evaluators were blinded to the therapy group to which the patient belonged.
