However, there is no literature on the effectiveness of combined application of these modalities in the treatment of patients with poststroke dysphagia. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate whether combined NMES, FEES and traditional swallowing rehabilitation can improve swallowing functions in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["dysphagia,endoscopy, electrical stimulation,stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The combination group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received 12 sessions of NMES for 1 hour /day, 5 days/week within a period of 2-3 weeks.
