The primary hypothesis is that home blood pressure telemonitoring supplemented with individualized, culturally tailored telephone-based nurse case management will have greater effects on blood pressure reduction and stroke recurrence and, while it will be more costly, it will also be more cost-effective than home blood pressure telemonitoring alone. Results of this study will provide strong empirical evidence to inform clinical guidelines and practice, which may lead to reductions in stroke disparities in the United States."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":450,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will take home BP readings 3 days per week (morning and evening) for one week out of each month during the 12-month intervention.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM)"]},{"label":"HBPTM + Nurse Case Management (NCM)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will complete the same Home BP Telemonitoring protocol and will also complete 20 counseling phone calls with a nurse case manager during the 12-month intervention.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM)","Behavioral: Nurse Case Management (NCM)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM)","description":"Participants will take home BP readings 3 days per week (morning and evening), one week out of every month for 12 months.
