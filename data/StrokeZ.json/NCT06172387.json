One in every four people is affected by stroke at different times in life. Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and third leading cause of disability in adults. we hypothesized that in patients with acute large vessel occlusive ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy, the infusion of 20% human serum albumin solution into the revascularization area can exert a stronger neuroprotective effect.","detailedDescription":"In the previous period, we have conducted a clinical trial on the safety and feasibility of arterial infusion of 20% human serum albumin solution. The results of the study found that after arterial infusion of 20% human serum albumin solution at a dose of 0.6g/kg to the subject's vascularization area, the subjects did not develop significant complications related to albumin solution. There were no serious adverse events associated with arterial infusion of albumin solution in all subjects. After the evaluation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board, the clinical study was considered to be the next step, which is to initially explore the effectiveness of 0.6g/kg arterial infusion of 20% human serum albumin solution for neuroprotection of subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","albumin","intra-arterial","thrombectomy","neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intra-arterial group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20% human serum albumin (0.6g/kg) solution will be injected into the artery after revascularization in acute ischemic stroke.
