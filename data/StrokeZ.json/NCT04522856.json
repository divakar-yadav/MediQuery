Current guidelines for periprocedural anaesthesiological care give gross recommendations on management of stroke patients during recanalization, but lack detailed information.\n\nTo determine how anaesthesiologists support endovascular thrombectomy with regard to anaesthetic technique, choice of substances, haemodynamic management, and ventilation. With a multivariate analysis, the investigators will look for the factors of anesthetic management that are independently correlated with a good or bad outcome.","detailedDescription":"see brief summary"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["Endovascular thrombectomy","acute ischaemic stroke","large-vessel occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","description":"Local"},{"label":"B","description":"Nested"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological outcome 90 days after the stroke","description":"Neurological outcome is measured using the modified Rankin Scale \\[0-6\\], with higher values indicating worse outcome.
