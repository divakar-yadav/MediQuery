Stroke participants are recruited from the rehabilitation ward of CGMH hospital.\n\nThe inclusion criteria are (a) first-time unilateral cerebral stroke, (b) stroke onset less or equal to 1 year, (c) admission to the rehabilitation ward, (d) ages 20-80 years, (e) spasticity of paretic arm ≤ grade 2 in the Modified Ashworth Scale, and (f) no active medical problems such as fever, pneumonia, or scabies. The exclusion criteria are (a) brainstem or cerebellar stroke, (b) epilepsy history, including photosensitive epilepsy, (c) previous or active heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction or angina, (d) visuospatial problems related to stroke, such as hemianopia or hemineglect, (e) paretic upper limb reaches Brunnstrom recovery stage VI, (f) severe aphasia, (g) severe cognitive impairment, and (h) poor cooperation with assessments.\n\nAll participants are randomly allocated to study group and control group. Participants in the control group receive conventional rehabilitation therapy over 50 minutes on weekdays. Participants in the study group receive conventional rehabilitation therapy over 50 minutes on weekdays and 7 sessions (flexible schedule in different day) of PlayStation®VR of 20 minutes each in the main 16-day study period. Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up HRQOL will be assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0. Motricity Index and Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Functional Independence Measure, and arm movement ratio will also be checked before intervention, after intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. The safety outcome, intervention-related adverse events or any serious adverse events, during study period will be recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Virtual Reality","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"All participants are randomly allocated to study group and control group.
