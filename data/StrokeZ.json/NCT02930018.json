Subjects harboring an acute ischemic stroke and who are selected for endovascular revascularization in accordance with local institutional practices and who harbor a small established infarct core and with good collateral circulation will be given a single, 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous dose of Nerinetide (NA-1) or placebo as soon as they are deemed to have met the enrollment criteria and with the intention of starting administration within 30 minutes of randomization.
