This study compared the effectiveness of standardised, low and high intensity behavioral intervention for dysphagia with that of \"usual care\".","detailedDescription":"Stroke compromises swallowing function, causing dysphagia, in one quarter to one half of all patients. Dysphagia is associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, dehydration and malnutrition. Despite the development and implementation of several strategies of managing dysphagia after stroke, Few have been evaluated by means of randomised controlled trials.\n\nComparisons: This study aims to compare stroke patients with dysphagia assigned to receive usual swallowing care, prescribed by the attending physician; standardised low intensity intervention comprising swallowing compensation strategies and diet prescription; or standardised high intensity intervention and dietary prescription ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia"],"keywords":["Swallowing disorder","Stroke","Standardized swallowing therapy","Randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"behavioral swallowing exercises/ strategies"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"survival free of an abnormal diet at 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"time to return to normal diet over the study"},{"measure":"recovery of swallowing ability at 6 months after stroke"},{"measure":"the occurrence of dysphagia - related medical complications at 6 months."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* clinical diagnosis of stroke within the previous 7 days\n* clinical diagnosis of swallowing difficulty\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* no previous history of swallowing treatment\n* no previous history of surgery of the head or neck","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Graeme Hankey, MBBS, MD,","affiliation":"Royal Perth Hospital","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Giselle D Mann, MPH,PhD","affiliation":"Royal Perth Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Royal Perth Hospital","city":"Perth","state":"Western Australia","zip":"6000","country":"Australia","geoPoint":{"lat":-31.95224,"lon":115.8614}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"16361020","type":"RESULT","citation":"Carnaby G, Hankey GJ, Pizzi J.
