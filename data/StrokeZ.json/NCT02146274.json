To achieve these goals, we will link the nation's largest stroke registry, the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program and nationwide Medicare claims data, coupled with telephone interviews for longitudinal treatment and downstream patient-reported outcomes.\n\nDesign \\& Procedures:\n\nRetrospective: Using GWTG-Stroke database and its associated 1900 hospitals, we will conduct several comparative research protocols prioritized by stroke survivor focus groups and surveys. GWTG-Stroke registry clinical data linked with Medicare claims will be used for analysis of effectiveness and safety of post-stroke therapies on long-term clinical outcomes (n= 450,000). Outcomes of interest include:\n\n\"Home-time\" (days alive and at home) Death Stroke/TIA readmission All-cause readmission Cardiovascular readmission Bleeding readmission\n\nProspective:\n\nWe will use the existing AVAIL registry combined with an additional 2000 stroke survivors for a combined cohort of over 5000 patients to obtain detailed information on patient-reported outcomes. The AVAIL Registry (IRB # Pro00012243) collected data from 3000 stroke survivors between 2006 and 2008. We plan to use these data to supplement our prospective PROSPER study. The PROSPER study will enroll a minimum of 2,000 subjects to augment the data collected from the AVAIL study. Consented patients from at least 75 sites will complete interviews at 3 and 6 months after discharge. We anticipate that the PROSPER questionnaire will include the following tools: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8), modified Rankin scale (mRS), Barthel Index, EuroQOL (EQ-5D), Stroke-specific quality of life (SSQOL-12) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Sites will consent interested patients and have them complete a patient contact information form which includes, name, address, phone numbers, email address, etc. Outcomes of interest include: : Post-stroke fatigue, Depression, Chronic pain, Medication intolerance, Modified Rankin scale (mRS), EuroQOL and Stroke-specific quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["PROSPER","Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1877,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Stroke Patients","description":"Patients who have had an ischemic stroke that are hospitalized in an acute-care setting."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Depression","description":"Patient Health Questionnaire - 2 Item (PHQ-2) Higher score suggests more depression; range of 0-6.
