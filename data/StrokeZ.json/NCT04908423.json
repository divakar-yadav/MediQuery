Physical function will be quantified as time to complete the instrumented TUG.\n\nA one-group pretest-post-test experimental design will be used. Participants will be tested on the primary and secondary outcome measures before upper extremity injection with Xeomin® and 4 to 6 weeks thereafter. Additionally, participants will be contacted for an end of study visit via telephone approximately 12-weeks post Xeomin® injection to obtain information regarding any adverse events and gain insight into the therapeutic duration of the Xeomin®. The proposed duration of the study is 2 years to allow adequate time for screening, recruitment and follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"A one-group pretest-post-test experimental design will be used.
