A relatively common problem encountered with these patients is non-responsiveness to clopidogrel therapy. A prior study in cardiac patients showed that the addition of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Lovaza, or \"fish oil\") can increase a patient's response to therapy with clopidogrel, but there have been no studies in neuro patients. In this study, patients will be divided into one of two groups: in the study arm, patients will receive clopidogrel +/- aspirin as well as Lovaza. In the control arm, patients will only receive clopidogrel +/- aspirin. Assays will be done to measure responsiveness to clopdiogrel on days 0, 12-24 hours after loading dose, day 3-5 if still inpatient, and at a follow-up visit 20-30 days after the start of the study. The investigators believe that this study will show an increase in platelet aggregation in patients receiving both clopidogrel and Lovaza."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
