Quantitative data will be analyzed descriptively.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the leading cause of death and adult disability. Transitioning from hospital to home is a challenging process for stroke survivors and their families, leading to frustration and adverse health outcomes for survivors and caregivers. To address both the survivor and caregiver needs, dyad-focused interventions are necessary to be implemented in the transitioning process. However, very few interventions were designed to address the needs of the dyad and place an equal emphasis on both survivors' and caregivers' outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a dyad-focused intervention built upon the theoretical tenets of strategy training to help prepare stroke survivors and their caregivers to transit to community living. The study will involve two phases. In phase one, the intervention protocol will be developed through literature review, expert panel meeting, and focus groups with rehabilitation therapists, stroke survivors, and caregivers. In phase two, a feasibility study will be conducted to evaluate the acceptability and suitability of this newly-developed intervention and outcome measures to stroke survivor-caregiver dyads.\n\nA mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) design, including a repeated measures design, will be used in this feasibility study. Fifteen to twenty stroke survivor-caregiver dyads are expected to be recruited. Adult stroke survivors who have been diagnosed with stroke, are about to be discharged from inpatient wards to home or has been discharged home within the past 3 months, have an identified adult caregiver who provides care or assistance of any kind and taking responsibility for the survivor and is available to participate in the intervention sessions with the survivor will be eligible to participate in the study. These participants will receive the dyad-focused strategy training intervention using the developed intervention protocol. Standardized assessments will be used to assess dyadic outcomes such as goal attainment, quality of life, self-efficacy, participation, depressive symptoms, and survivor-caregiver relationship at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The feasibility indicators, such as recruitment rates and intervention attendance and adherence, will be evaluated by questionnaires, field notes, and qualitative interviews after the interventions are completed.\n\nQuantitative data will be analyzed descriptively; while data obtained from the outcome measures will be examined using Wilcoxon signed rank test and effect size (r) to compare the differences between the pre- and post-intervention scores. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Caregiver","Stroke","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dyad- focused strategy training intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The dyad-focused strategy training intervention protocol will be developed to help dyads manage the needs that they have as transitioning to the community.\n\nThe following theoretical frameworks and guidelines will be used to guide the development of the intervention: (1) the strategy training guideline outlined by Skidmore et al; (2) Bodenmann's framework of dyadic coping; and (3) Self-efficacy theory.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Dyad-focused strategy training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Dyad-focused strategy training","description":"Rehabilitation therapists will be hired to deliver the intervention to the stroke survivors-caregiver dyads on a one-to-two base.
