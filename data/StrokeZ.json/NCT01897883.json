Fifty centres from different regions of China will participate in this study.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicentre, cross-sectional, observational study, aiming to investigate the prevalence and control situation of dyslipidimia in China post ischemic stroke patients within 6-12 months from attack. Patients will be screened consecutively, eligible subjects will be interviewed by investigator and finish a questionire during the visit. Investigator will collect relevant medical history, physical exam results and lab test results including blood lipid (i.e. Triglyceride, Total Cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C) and glucose(HbA1c if available).Approximately 5000 post ischemic stroke patients within 6-12 months from attack will enter into the study.
