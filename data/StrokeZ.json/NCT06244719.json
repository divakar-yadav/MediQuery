The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nAre the wearables well-tolerated by patients? Does the vibrotactile stimulation help regain arm function?\n\nParticipants will wear vibrotactile stimulation gloves and shirts for 5 hours daily during their stay at the rehabilitation unit, in addition to conventional therapy. Researchers will compare the treatment group (vibrotactile stimulation wearables) with a control group (conventional therapy only) to see the effects of the vibrotactile stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vibrotactile Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants wear vibrotactile stimulation shirts and gloves for 5 hours per day, 7 days per week, during their stay at the rehabilitation unit, which is expected to be between 2-3 weeks.
