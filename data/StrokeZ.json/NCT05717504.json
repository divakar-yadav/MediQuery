Its name comes from the fibrillation (i.e. quivering) of the two upper chambers (atria) of the heart instead of a coordinated contraction, causing a rapid, irregular heart rate. This irregular contraction is ineffective, leading to the development clots in the heart. These clots can travel through the bloodstream until they get stuck in a brain artery. Millions of brain cells that depend on the oxygen supplied by the blocked artery die within minutes. This is known as a stroke. Strong blood thinners known as anticoagulants can lower stroke risk by 64% in AF patients when the AF is detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG) or if it lasts more than 24h on a heart monitor. Therefore, doctors use cardiac monitors to record the heartbeats of stroke patients for up to 3 years. It was historically thought, but not proven, that if AF was found in stroke patients, using anticoagulants could prevent a second stroke. However, recent information suggests that using cardiac monitors in stroke patients increases AF detection and anticoagulants prescription without a reduction in the number of new strokes. The failure to prevent a second stroke is likely the consequence of cardiac monitors sometimes detecting very short-duration AFs, which may have a low risk of stroke. If AFs last only for a few minutes or hours, anticoagulants may not be needed.\n\nPatients with a stroke and not know atrial fibrillation will be implanted with a loop recorder and randomized in two groups (disclosure arm and non-disclosure arm). Patients will have phone follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months after implantation. A quality-of-life survey will be performed at the last study visit.\n\nThis study will assess if it is possible to organize a large clinical trial comparing the use of long-term vs. shorter-term heart monitoring. The investigators will evaluate 24 patients, between the 3 centers, in the same way, the investigators plan to evaluate a larger number of participants (\\>1000) in a future study. This will allow us to learn if such a study is possible, identify potential implementation challenges, and develop strategies to overcome those difficulties."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Implantable Loop Recorder","Anticoagulant","Stroke","Atrial fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Disclosure","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Group A (disclosure arm): patients and physicians will be informed about all AF episodes identified on ILR lasting for ≥6 minutes.","interventionNames":["Device: Implantable Loop Recorder","Other: Quality of life survey"]},{"label":"Non-Disclosure","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Group B (non-disclosure arm): patients and physicians will be only informed about AF episodes identified on ILR lasting for ≥24h.
