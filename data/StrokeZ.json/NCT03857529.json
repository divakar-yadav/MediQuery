The stimulator will be programmed to deliver stimulation with an intensity that corresponds to the opening of a glove instrumented with sensors and plugged into the stimulator (i.e., CCFES).\n\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): TDCS is a method of noninvasive stimulation of the brain. Using electrodes placed in saline-soaked sponges, low level of direct current (1mA) is delivered over the scalp. This intervention is considered safe and noninvasive because it does not involve implantation or injection or any skin penetration.","armGroupLabels":["conventional tDCS concurrent with CCFES","conventional tDCS preceding CCFES","sham tDCS with CCFES","unconventional tDCS concurrent with CCFES","unconventional tDCS preceding CCFES"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Corticospinal Excitability","description":"Change in corticospinal excitability will be measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation","timeFrame":"up to one hour post intervention"},{"measure":"Reaction Time","description":"Change in reaction time will be assessed with visual and auditory cues.","timeFrame":"up to one hour post intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
