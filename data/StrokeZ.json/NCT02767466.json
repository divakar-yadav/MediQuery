Both before and after the treatments, a self-report Mood Survey Scale (MSS) was used to assess the effects on the treatment on distinct affective states. The subscales of the MSS were tested for pre-post changes and different effects between treatments with non-parametric tests."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurological Incidents","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"G","description":"All participants were randomly exposed to two different treatments:\n\n* Conventional physical therapy (no specific device used)\n* Robotic assisted gait training (Lokomat, Hocoma AG, Switzerland)\n\nWe consider the study as observational, since the both interventions of the study (physical therapy, robotic assisted gait training) did not change in the patients' usual therapy plan, as they received both interventions daily.\n\nWe only added diagnostic interventions to assess the affective responses.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Physical therapy and robotic assisted gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Physical therapy and robotic assisted gait training","armGroupLabels":["G"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of subscales of mood survey scale from pre to post treatment","timeFrame":"30-60 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* voluntary participation\n* neurological incident\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* lack of communication ability\n* interference of consciousness\n* inability to speak German language","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with neurological disorders","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Martin Kopp, Prof","affiliation":"Univeryity of Innsbruck","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001930","term":"Brain Injuries"},{"id":"D000070642","term":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000006259","term":"Craniocerebral Trauma"},{"id":"D000020196","term":"Trauma, Nervous System"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4897","name":"Brain Injuries","asFound":"Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M628","name":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic","asFound":"Traumatic Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9039","name":"Craniocerebral Trauma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21713","name":"Trauma, Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
