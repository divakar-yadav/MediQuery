The light accelerates blood and cells circulation in the human body, so that protein molecular structure would promote changes. Pain control is indicated in such treatment, but still lacking evidence of neurological symptoms and functional improvement.\n\nPurpose:This research is designed through randomization, control, and double-blind trial to therapeutic effect and platelet activity after intravenous laser irradiation of blood for ischemic stroke patient. Furthermore, to establish a new way of clinical rehabilitation therapy.\n\nMethod: The investigators plan to recruit 20 patients who are between the ages of 20 to 80 years old. The participants are required to have clear conscious and be able to communicate. The patient with mild to moderate stroke ( NIHSS=1-15), which onset between one month to 2 years will be included. The treatment group will receive an intravenous helium-neon laser phototherapy. A vein indwelling needle will be placed in their veins located in the upper elbow, and the laser fiber catheter will be introduced through the indwelling cannula. The power is set between 2.5 \\~ 3.0Mw, 60 minutes each time, once a day for five consecutive days each week, for 2 weeks (total 10 times in one course). The steps for the control group are the same, except that the output power is adjusted to zero intensity. This plan will be explained to the patient in detail during the outpatient visit and patients will sign the consent form upon agreement. Before intravenous laser irradiation, three days, one month, and three months after the therapy, 20 ml of autologous peripheral venous blood need to be drawn for basic blood tests and platelet activity tests. At the same time, the clinical functions of patients will be evaluated, including NIHSS, mRS and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","intravenous laser irradiation of blood","platele activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The treatment group receive an intravenous helium-neon laser phototherapy.
