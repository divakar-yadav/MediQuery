The exosuit provides dynamic dorsiflexion and plantarflexion assist during walking. We will determine the effect of training parameters of intensity, repetition, and gait quality which are all key parameters associated with experience-dependent neuroplasticity. The other objective is to determine the effect of this intervention on community walking activity, walking speed, walking distance, and locomotor mechanics and energetics."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["exoskeleton","ambulation","robotics","Stroke","walking"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Previous work has demonstrated that the tuning of the exosuit technology is important for each patient post stroke to be able to maximally utilize the technology. These modulations include when the plantarflexion force is delivered, and how to deliver the assistance within a training session however it is still unclear how to implement this into a training protocol.

Patients will be directed to walk at their preferred and maximum but safe speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk the entire distance and past the end line approximately 1 meter. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be recorded using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.15 sec).","timeFrame":"Baseline Day 1-3, Midpoint at week 6, Post-intervention at week 12"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in 6 Minute Walk Test in distance from baseline","description":"The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) measures the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at study completion. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.","timeFrame":"Baseline Day 1-3, Midpoint at week 6, Post-intervention at week 12"},{"measure":"Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)","description":"The Functional Gait Assessment is a 10 item test used to assess postural stability during walking tasks.
