The study team will load the MedRem app onto two Apple Watch 4s for use during the study. As the device is placed on the wrist, it is free from the limitations of smartphones. However, one of the major challenges in developing interactive systems for wrist devices is their form factor. The touch screens available on these devices are tiny and much smaller compared to smart phones and tablet computers. MedRem enables user interactions by incorporating speech recognition and text-to-speech features along with clever interface design. The tiny display of the device is used for minimal inputs and outputs, while a user can retrieve and provide more information from/to the system through voice commands. Personalized models are built and updated over time to reduce errors in recognizing users' voice commands, and thus better user experience is provided."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Medication Adherence"],"keywords":["Remote monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Phase 1 - determine the feasibility of the Apple Watch medication/exercise reminder system MedRem by deploying the system to control subjects.\n\nPhase 2 of study- assess the subjects' adherence to medications, exercise and checking heart rate (and quality of the exercise), with the use of MedRem\n\nâ€¢ assess the acceptance and usability of the MedRem system.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MedRem application","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MedRem smartwatch application","interventionNames":["Device: MedRem application"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MedRem application","description":"Medication adherence smartwatch application","armGroupLabels":["MedRem application"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Use of MedRem System","description":"Assess the patients' adherence to medications and exercise.
