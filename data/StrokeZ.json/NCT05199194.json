Randomization will be 1:1 according to reperfusion treatment modalities: (A) (with placebo TNK) direct mechanical thrombectomy vs. (B) Intravenous thrombolysis with TNK (0.25 mg/kg) plus mechanical thrombectomy. Randomization will be done by a minimization process using age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and site of the occluded artery. For the primary outcome, the subjects will be followed up within 90 days after randomization. The primary outcome will be the ordinal distribution from the modified Rankin scale score (mRS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Tenecteplase","TNK","MT","Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":390,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mechanical Thrombectomy preceded by TNK","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects assigned to this arm will receive an intravenous bolus of tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg) before the mechanical thrombectomy.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Mechanical Thrombectomy preceded by Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects assigned to this arm will receive an intravenous bolus of matching placebo (with the same volume of infusion as of 0.25mg/kg of tenecteplase) before the mechanical thrombectomy.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg","armGroupLabels":["Mechanical Thrombectomy preceded by TNK"],"otherNames":["TNK"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Intravenous administration of placebo, matching the volume of tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg","armGroupLabels":["Mechanical Thrombectomy preceded by Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Distribution of the modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days","description":"Distribution of the modified Rankin Scale scores (shift analysis).","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional independence defined as modified Rankin Score ≤ 2","description":"Functional independence defined as modified Rankin Score ≤ 2","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Infarct volume evaluated on CT at 24 hours (-2/+12 hours).","description":"Infarct volume evaluated on CT at 24 hours (-2/+12 hours).","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Dramatic early favorable response as determined by a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 0-2 or NIHSS improvement ≥ 10 points at 24 (-2/+12 hours) hours.","description":"Dramatic early favorable response as determined by a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 0-2 or NIHSS improvement ≥ 10 points at 24 (-2/+12 hours) hours.","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular therapy alone vs. endovascular therapy associated with tenecteplase","description":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular therapy alone vs. endovascular therapy associated with tenecteplase","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Quality of life analysis as measured by EuroQol/EQ5D at 3 month, 6 months and one year among the groups","description":"Quality of life analysis as measured by EuroQol/EQ5D at 3 month, 6 months and one year among the groups","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months and 12 months"},{"measure":"Score distribution of mRS at 90 days (shift analysis) in patients presenting M2-CMA occlusion","description":"Score distribution of mRS at 90 days (shift analysis) in patients presenting M2-CMA occlusion","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Vessel recanalization evaluated by CT angiography or MRA at 24 hours in both treatment groups","description":"Vessel recanalization evaluated by CT angiography or MRA at 24 hours in both treatment groups","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Vessel recanalization post procedure in the endovascular arm assessed by TIMI grades and adjudicated by a central core-lab.
