Furthermore, the study will also examine the effect of intensive antihypertensive treatment on the intermediate cardiovascular diseases outcomes, including CIMT, carotid plaques, PWV ABI, and kidney function, etc.","detailedDescription":"The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT, NCT00794885) found that among hypertensive adults in China without a history of stroke or myocardial infarction, the combined use of enalapril and folic acid, compared with enalapril alone, significantly reduced the risk of first stroke. The mean systolic blood pressures were highly comparable between the two groups over the course of the trial (139.7mmHg and 139.8mmHg, respectively, in the enalapril-folic acid and the enalapril group). In the further analysis, lower systolic blood pressures seemed to be associated with greater reduction in cardiovascular outcomes in both of the treatment groups.\n\nHowever, due to inconsistencies in the results of the ACCORD and SPRINT trials, the appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure in effectively reducing cardiovascular events among hypertensive patients remain uncertain.\n\nThe proposed trial aims to test the hypothesis that among hypertensive patients aged 60 years or older, a lower systolic blood pressure goal will lead to greater reduction in stroke incidence.\n\nThe current feasibility study aims to test whether the blood pressure level of the study patients can be effectively and safely managed according to the intensive antihypertensive treatment protocol. Furthermore, the study will also examine the effect of intensive antihypertensive treatment on the intermediate cardiovascular diseases outcomes, including CIMT, carotid plaques, PWV ABI, and kidney function, etc.\n\nThe current feasibility study will enroll approximately 100 patients with H-type hypertension (hypertensive patients with hyperhomocysteinemia) aged 60 years or older, and without a history of major cardiovascular diseases.\n\nEligible patients will randomly assigned to one of three different systolic blood pressure (SBP) target groups (Group A, SBP: 140 - \\<150 mmHg; Group B, SBP: 130 - \\< 140 mmHg; and Group C, SBP \\< 130 mmHg)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Hyperhomocysteinemia"],"keywords":["hypertension","BP titration","intensive blood pressure control","primary prevention","China","H-type Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard BP control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SBP within 140 - \\<150 mmHg.
