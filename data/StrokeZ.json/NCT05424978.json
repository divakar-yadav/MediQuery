Methods: Clinical data and information of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received standardized green channel treatment for stroke were collected, and a multicenter observational clinical study was carried out in the real world to evaluate the prognosis, mortality, incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage, incidence of pneumonia, and recurrence rate of stroke after 90 days.","detailedDescription":"The standardized green channel treatment system for acute ischemic stroke includes: Triage nurse triage timely, rapid assessment emergency doctor, suspected stroke the green channel, immediately start in the green channel of stroke accompanied by doctors and nurses stroke patients improve CT examination, intravenous thrombolysis or CT room, emergency room if considering large vascular lesions and the onset time in 6 hours, and rapidly to international for endovascular treatment, if the onset time of more than 6 hours, Rapid evaluation of ischemic penumbra and vascular occlusion by multi-mode imaging.
