Thus, imagery provides both the learning of the new movement and the improvement of the quality of movement by repeating the known activities.the investigators These neurophysiological findings obtained in recent years have popularized the use of motor imagery approach in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.\n\n32 stroke patients aged 50-75 years will be included in the study. Cases will be randomized into 2 groups.\n\nIn our study, a treatment program will be applied with a physiotherapist for a total of 8 weeks, 2 days a week. The first group in the treatment program; Motor imagery will be performed with the Bobath Therapeutic Approach (BTA+MI) and the second group will be physical practice of imagery activities after motor imagery with the Bobath Therapeutic Approach (BTA+MI+PP). Motor imagery activity was determined as 'eating activity'.\n\nThe desired goal as a result of our work; the investigators think that motor imagery training on eating activity of stroke patients and physical practice used together will improve both the achievement of eating activity and upper extremity motor function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Motor imagery","Physical practice","Bobath therapeutic approach"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment (Outcomes Assessor)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Motor imagery and Bobath Therapeutic Approach (BTA+MI)","interventionNames":["Other: Group 1 Motor imagery and Bobath Therapeutic Approach (BTA+MI)"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Motor imagery, Bobath Therapeutic Approach and Physical practice (BTA+MI+PP)","interventionNames":["Other: Group 2 Motor imagery, Bobath Therapeutic Approach and Physical practice (BTA+MI+PP)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Group 1 Motor imagery and Bobath Therapeutic Approach (BTA+MI)","description":"Motor imagery (MI) is the mental rehearsal of motor abilities to improve function.
