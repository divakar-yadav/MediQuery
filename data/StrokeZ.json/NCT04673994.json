We will enroll 25 young healthy adults (CONyoung) as a reference group. Our hypothesis is that the cerebrovascular response in individuals with chronic stroke will be significantly lower: 1) during a single bout of HIIT, and 2) during the recovery immediately following and 30 minutes after HIIT, compared to CON.\n\nThis study has 2 visits at the University of Kansas Medical Center Research in Exercise and Cardiovascular Health Laboratory. For the first visit, we will perform questionnaires about heart health, physical activity and overall health. Participants will then complete a submaximal exercise test on a seated stepper. Participants will also have a familiarization session to practice HIIT. The second visit will include cerebrovascular measures before, during, immediately after, and 30 minutes after performing HIIT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","High Intensity Interval Exercise"],"keywords":["Cerebral Blood Velocity","Cerebral Autoregulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":91,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chronic Stroke","description":"Individuals 40-80 years old who have had a stroke 6 months to 5 years ago.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Single, acute bout of high intensity interval exercise"]},{"label":"CON","description":"Control group (CON) comprised of age- and sex-matched healthy adults.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Single, acute bout of high intensity interval exercise"]},{"label":"CONyoung","description":"Healthy, young adult control group (CONyoung) who are age 18-30 years old.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Single, acute bout of high intensity interval exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Single, acute bout of high intensity interval exercise","description":"Individuals will perform a single bout of high intensity interval exercise on a seated recumbent stepper.
