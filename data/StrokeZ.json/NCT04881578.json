If on the other hand side a PFO and AF is found, lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation is mandatory.\n\nBy using the contemporary ICM protocols to search for silent AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke and a PFO for 3 months before PFO closure, ALFA ROMEO will help to understand the relationship of silent and previously undetected AF in the setting of PFO and investigate the true incidence of new-onset AF and its temporal course after effective PFO closure. Our findings will have the potential to impact on the future diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with cryptogenic stroke and a PFO"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cryptogenic Stroke","Foramen Ovale, Patent","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["occlusion of patent foramen ovale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"continuous cardiac monitoring before and after transcatheter PFO closure","description":"Data will be assessed from patients with cryptogenic stroke and planned PFO occlusion who undergo the contemporary ICM protocols to search for silent AF"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"incidence of first AF within 12 months after percutaneous PFO occlusion","description":"to assess the incidence of first AF within 12 months after percutaneous PFO closure with a prespecified landmark analysis after 3 months to differentiate potentially device related AF (months 0-3) from likely intrinsic AF (months 4-12)","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of first AF within 3 months of continuous rhythm monitoring before the intended percutaneous PFO closure procedure","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Overall incidence of first AF from ICM-implantation to ICM-explantation or 36 months post implantation (if ICM remains in situ) excluding a blanking period of the first 3 months after PFO closure","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Differences in the primary endpoint according to the grade of the PFO","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of recurrent clinical embolic events such as cryptogenic strokes or systemic embolism including pulmonary embolism (with the use of the TOAST classification algorithm)","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"AF burden, defined as proportion of follow-up time with documented AF at different time points","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of major bleeding (BARC 3 to 5)","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of any death and cardiovascular death at different timepoints","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Device related events","timeFrame":"36 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of embolic events such as cryptogenic stroke or systemic embolism (single event or multiple events). A stroke is considered to be cryptogenic if no possible cause can be determined despite extensive workup according to the standard protocol of the participating center (TOAST classification 5b) (29). Before inclusion in the study, the following tests are required as standard tests to establish the diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke:\n\n   * MRI or computed tomography (CT) of the neurocranium (documenting ischemic embolic stroke)\n   * 12-lead ECG (exclusion of AF)\n   * Continuous ECG monitoring for at least 7 days (inpatient telemetry or Holter-ECG as an in- or outpatient\n   * Ultrasonography, CT or MRI angiography of head and neck to rule out arterial disease as a cause of stroke (see below), or other potential causes of stroke\n2. Cardiac monitoring is planned to be performed with the BIOMONITOR III(m) device\n3. Presence of right-to-left shunt through a PFO as assessed by means of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with agitated saline while the patient is at rest or while a Valsalva maneuver is being performed.\n4. Occlusion of PFO is planned to be performed with the AMPLATZERTM PFO OCCLUDER device.\n5. Patient is willing to sign patient consent form.\n6. Age ≥18 years.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known etiology of the embolic event (based on neuro-/cardiac/vascular imaging), such as:\n\n   * Evidence of large-artery atherosclerosis (ultrasonography, CT or MRI angiography, or digital subtraction angiography) with stenosis of 50% or more in the artery feeding the acute ischemic territory.\n   * Small vessel disease, defined by radiographic appearance consistent with ischemic infarction in the territory of a perforating arteriole, with ≤20 mm in diameter on axial sections and not involving the cortex, located in the white matter, internal or external capsule, deep brain nuclei, thalamus, or brainstem.\n   * Evidence of a high-risk cardiac or aortic arch source of embolism (left ventricular or left atrial thrombus or \"smoke,\" emboligenic valvular lesion or tumor, aortic arch plaque \\>3 mm thick or with mobile components or any other high-risk lesion)\n   * Stroke of other determined cause such as presence of non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies (i.e. dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia), hypercoagulable states (must be tested in patients \\<55 years old) and hematologic disorders\n2. Atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect.\n3. Coronary or valvular disease requiring surgical intervention.\n4. Documented history of AF or atrial flutter.\n5. Permanent indication for therapeutic oral anticoagulation at enrollment.\n6. Already included in another clinical trial that will affect the objectives of this study.\n7. Life expectancy \\<1 year.\n8. Pregnancy.\n9. Patient underwent or is scheduled for implantation of a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy device.\n10. Unable or unwilling to follow the required procedures of the Clinical Investigation Plan.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
