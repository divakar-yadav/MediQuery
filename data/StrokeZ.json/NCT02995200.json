The objectives of this pilot study are to:\n\ni.) determine the feasibility of using accelerometers to quantify amount of UE use in the home setting in healthy individuals and individuals chronic post-stroke,\n\nii.) quantify and compare the unilateral activity of the weaker (paretic) versus stronger (non-paretic) UEs,\n\niii.) quantify and compare amount of UE use in healthy controls to that of people chronic post-stroke (side matched unimanual use for each arm and bilateral use) in the home, and\n\niv.) assess the effect of a few sessions of in-home accelerometer used-based feedback on unilateral and bilateral UE use.\n\nv.) assess kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data during UE movements bilaterally and between healthy controls and subjects post-chronic stroke pre and post feedback (for the people after stroke)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Feedback Intervention (Participants Post-stroke)","Healthy Control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group Post-Stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 sessions of in-home accelerometer based feedback about paretic arm use","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Accelerometer Based Feedback"]},{"label":"Healthy Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Accelerometer Based Feedback","armGroupLabels":["Group Post-Stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Amount of Use (measured by accelerometer)","timeFrame":"3 week period"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy Adults: 40-100 years old, able to follow 2-step commands, able to comply with experimental protocol, living in a home setting, full active range of motion (AROM) in both shoulders and elbows for their age group.\n* Individuals Post-stroke: Able to follow 2-step commands, 40 - 100 years old, community dwelling with or without assistance, no upper extremity (UE) injury within the last 3 months, at least 30 degrees of flexion AROM (with or without assistance) and PROM in shoulder and elbow in or out of synergy, intact superficial light touch sensation in both UEs, and at least 6 months post ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke that is either cortical, subcortical or in the cerebellum.
