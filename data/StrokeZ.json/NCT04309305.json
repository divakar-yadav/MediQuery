The study will compare the walking abilities of people who went through standard of care treatment after a stroke to those who used the robotic exoskeleton as part of their rehabilitation. This study will also look at the effects walking in the RE has on brain activity. The name of the robotic exoskeleton that is being used in this study is the EksoTM."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke RE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After discharge from the acute rehabilitation facility, participants in the stroke RE group will participate 3 days a week for 10 weeks in robotic exoskeleton gait training provided by a trained, licensed physical therapist.

hemiparesis\n* Medical clearance by the Medical Director\n* Be able to physically fit into the exoskeleton device.\n* Have joint range of motion within normal functional limits for ambulation.\n* Have sufficient strength to use the hemiwalker, cane or walker (etc. assistive device) while wearing the RE.\n* Patient cognitive status and ability to communicate in English must be at a level consistent with that required to participate in standard motor rehabilitation, e.g. can follow directions.\n* Adequate cognitive function to give informed consent, understand the training, instructions, use investigational devices and give adequate feedback.\n* No history of injury or pathology to the unaffected limb.\n* physically fit within the RE: Height below 60\" or above 76\" and weight above 220 lbs.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any medical issue that precludes full weight bearing and ambulation (e.g. orthopedic injuries, pain, severe spasticity).\n* Skin issues that would prevent wearing the device.\n* Pre-existing condition that caused exercise intolerance.(Documented uncontrolled hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure)\n* Hospitalization for heart attack, heart surgery or acute heart failure within 3 months of enrollment in study.\n* Severe cognitive or psychiatric problems as well as incontinence might be contraindications to start training with a RE.\n* History of severe cardiac disease such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure\n* Uncontrolled seizure disorder.\n* Uncontrolled spasticity or joint contracture that would interfere with walking in the RE and limits normal ROM during ambulation with assistive devices.\n* Neuromuscular or neurological pathologies (e.g., Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury with evidence of motor weakness and multiple sclerosis) that will interfere with neuromuscular function, ambulation, or limit the range of motion of the lower limbs\n*
