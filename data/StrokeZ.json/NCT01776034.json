Particularly, the study will focus on developing a program of research on adapting and testing SC weight management interventions in overweight and obese stroke survivors and persons with chronic inflammatory autoimmune/immune-mediated diseases, specifically those with multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).","detailedDescription":"Individuals with disabling conditions, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis, face many barriers to engaging in physical activity, healthy nutritional habits, and good sleep hygiene. This leads to weight gain, de-conditioning, and declines in upper- and lower- extremity function, which makes it even more difficult to engage in healthy behaviors, thereby perpetuating a cycle of functional decline. Developing an effective weight management intervention may be a strategy for disrupting this disabling cycle and reducing the impact of the disease. Fostering a positive social environment may help adults with disabling conditions overcome barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors. SystemCHANGE (SC) is a new behavior change program that uses approaches consistent with social ecological theories and process improvement techniques (i.e. changing the dynamics of a system or group) to increase social support in lifestyle behaviors that promote energy balance. SC focuses on redesigning the social environment using a series of trial-and-error \"experiments\", which is in contrast to cognitive-behavioral interventions that focus on changing a person's viewpoint of a situation and increasing motivation. In a SC intervention, individuals are taught a set of skills to assist them in incorporating habitual lifestyle behaviors into their daily systems so they succeed despite wavering motivation. The rationale for developing a weight management intervention for these patients is to slow disability progression and prevent secondary conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Multiple Sclerosis","Rheumatoid Arthritis"],"keywords":["Self Care","Exercise","Weight management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SystemCHANGE Group Lifestyle counseling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The SystemCHANGE™ intervention will be delivered over a six-month period involving 12 face-to-face group sessions (1.5 to 2 hours each) held weekly for three months, followed by three monthly \"booster calls.\" Intervention groups include \\~10 to 15 patients, and friends and family members are encouraged to attend.
