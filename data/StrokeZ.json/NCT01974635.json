We hypothesize that measureable improvement in the sensation of the upper limb will precede improvement in functional movement.","detailedDescription":"The AMES device performs tests of sensorimotor impairment as well as delivering therapy. In this study, we are testing 2 additional diagnostic tests (i.e., Joint Position Test and \"Frisbee\" Test), both of proprioception, in order to determine which of the two is the best test of proprioception. Our hypotheses are: (1) both sensation and movement recover with AMES treatment, (2) sensory recovery precedes that of movement, (3) robotic delivery of the Joint Position Test produces more reliable test results than does manual delivery of this test, and (4) the Frisbee Test results will parallel those of the Joint Position Test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injury","Stroke","Acquired Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Spinal Cord Injury","Robotic therapy","Rehabilitation","Sensation","Movement","Proprioception","Stroke","Acquired Brain Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AMES Therapy and Diagnostic","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"During treatment, the AMES device rotates the hand, into flexion and extension, while the patient assists with this motion,and while the lengthening muscle(s) are vibrated mechanically.
