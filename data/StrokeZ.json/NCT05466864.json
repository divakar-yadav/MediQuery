Therefore, it is extremely important to identify OSA in patients with stroke.\n\nWearable devices can greatly reduce the manpower and material requirements of traditional laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG). With Photoplethysmography (PPG) technology and neural network algorithms, the Belun ring and the sleeping platform not only can detect blood oxygen, and heart rate but also can identify sleep stage and estimate the severity of sleep apnea.\n\nIn this study, inpatients with acute ischemic stroke in the hospital will proceed with three nights test for recording the parameters of the autonomic nervous system in the acute phase, evaluate whether sleep apnea and the feasibility of the Belun sleep platform.\n\nIt is important that early recognition of OSA and prompt treatment, which can potentially improve OSA-associated adverse outcomes, as well as understanding the degree of autonomic nervous function impairment for patients with acute ischemic stroke. After smoothing this process, it can help clinicians more accurately comprehend the condition, timing of admission, and discharge."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep-Disordered Breathing","Sleep Architecture","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea","Central Sleep Apnea","Stroke","Sleep Position"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TMU Hospital","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Potential participants with suspected OSA will be identified from the schedule of the TMU sleep labs.

The Belun Ring, an FDA-cleared pulse oximeter, acquires signals from the radialis indicis artery of the proximal index finger. The Belun Ring total sleep time can be derived from features extracted from accelerometer, SpO2, and PPG signals, whereas Belun Ring AHI can be derived from Ring-TST and features extracted from HRV and SpO2 changes. The BSP proprietary OSA detection algorithm was using neural network. BSP performance can be improved by training the algorithm through continual data collection. To our knowledge, BSP is the only validated sleep platform using a medical-grade wearable pulse oximeter, actigraphy, and artificial intelligence algorithm that has the capability to identify sleep stages, detect OSA events, and monitor autonomic nervous system activity changes during sleep.","armGroupLabels":["TMU Hospital"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"AHI, duration with SpO2 < 90%, and SpO2 nadir, as well as sleep stage parameters (total sleep time [TST], wake time, REM time, and NREM time)","description":"To specifically assess the accuracy of BSP bAHI in predicting OSA by comparing to the concurrent in-lab PSG-AHI and to determine the accuracy of BSP sleep stage parameters by comparing to the concurrent PSG.\n\nBSP bAHI, BSP time with SpO2 \\< 90%, and BSP-SpO2 nadir will be extracted from BSP and compared to PSGAHI (4% hypopnea criteria), PSG time with SpO2 \\< 90% (PSG-T90), PSG-SpO2 nadir extracted from the concurrent PSG.\n\nBSP sleep stage parameters (total sleep time \\[TST\\], wake time, REM time, and NREM time) will be extracted from BSP and compared to the same parameters of the concurrent PSG.
