Financial capacity is, in fact, an instrumental activity of daily life (i.e. Instrumental Activity Of Daily Living, I-ADL) whose impairment negatively affects the functional autonomy of the individual, so as to be subject to legal protection.\n\nTo assess financial capacity, the Numerical Activities of Daily Living - Financial (NADL-F; Arcara et al., 2017) will be administered, a battery of tests aimed at investigating both financial performance and financial competence according to the most recent neuropsychological models proposed in the literature."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Brain Tumor","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":99,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with Parkinson's Disease/Parkinsonisms","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological tests"]},{"label":"Patients with brain tumors","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological tests"]},{"label":"Patients with ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological tests"]},{"label":"Healthy Controls","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Neuropsychological tests"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Neuropsychological tests","description":"Neuropsychological assessment with:\n\n* NADL-F\n* Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB)\n* functional scales assessing activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (I-ADL)\n* Mini-Mental Parkinson (MMP) - For Parkinson's Disease patients\n* Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) - for brain tumor and stroke patients","armGroupLabels":["Healthy Controls","Patients with Parkinson's Disease/Parkinsonisms","Patients with brain tumors","Patients with ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numerical Activity of Daily Living Financial (NADL-F) in Patients with Parkinson's Disease/Parkinsonisms","description":"Assessment of financial capacity; score range=0-62; higher scores indicate higher financial capacities","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"Numerical Activity of Daily Living Financial (NADL-F) in Patients with ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke","description":"Assessment of financial capacity; score range=0-62; higher scores indicate higher financial capacities","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in Numerical Activity of Daily Living - Financial (NADL-F)Patients with brain tumors","description":"Assessment of financial capacity; score range=0-62; higher scores indicate higher financial capacities","timeFrame":"At 3 and 12 months follow up"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","description":"Assessment of global cognitive functioning","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB)","description":"Assessment of global cognitive functioning","timeFrame":"At baseline"},{"measure":"Activities of daily living questionnaire (ADL)","description":"Assessment of function independence in everyday life","timeFrame":"At baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age \\> 18 years\n* Clinical diagnosis of interest for clinical groups\n* For stroke patients: disease duration \\> 1 month\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Other brain disorders different from those of interest\n* Sensory-motor deficits that could prevent neuropsychological assessment\n* Language disorders that could prevent neuropsychological assessment\n* Global cognitive impairment as indexed by MoCA \\< 26 or MMP \\< 22.85","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"99 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"* Patients with Parkinson's Disease/parkinsonisms\n* Patients with brain tumor\n* Patients with stroke\n* Healthy controls","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Nadia Bolognini, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39025821","phoneExt":"8132","email":"n.bolognini@auxologico.it"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Milan","state":"Lombardia","zip":"20122","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Nadia Bolognini, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39025821","phoneExt":"8132","email":"n.bolognini@auxologico.it"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.46427,"lon":9.18951}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28880732","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Arcara G, Burgio F, Benavides-Varela S, Toffano R, Gindri P, Tonini E, Meneghello F, Semenza C.
