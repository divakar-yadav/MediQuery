Using intravenous thrombolysis combined with intra-arterial therapy to recanalize occluded vessels in eligible patients is recommended by current guidelines. Five randomized clinical trials showed that modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) 2b/3 recanalization can be achieved in 59-88% of acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation large artery occlusion，but only an average of 46% of patients have a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score \\[mRS\\] 0-2). Therefore, new therapeutic strategies in addition to thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke are urgently needed.\n\nAs early as 1987, Busto et al. found that lowering of the brain temperature by only a few degrees during ischemia confers a marked neuroprotective effect. Therapeutic hypothermia has been suggested to be the most potent neuroprotective strategy in recent years5，and a number of clinical studies in patients with acute cerebral infarction also showed that mild hypothermia (33-35 ℃) can increase tolerance to ischemic insults and play a significant neuroprotective role after reperfusion. However, adverse events such as pneumonia, affecting up to 35% of treated patients occurs with hypothermia. Since selective brain cooling does not require a reduction in core body temperature, it is theoretically possible to avoid many serious adverse effects caused by whole body hypothermia.\n\nThe investigators have previous shown that short-duration selective brain cooling by the intra-arterial infusion of cold saline combined with mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke is feasible and safe. The efficacy of selective brain cooling in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, however, is not established. The investigators therefore conducted this RCT study to explore the efficacy of short-duration selective brain cooling in patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypothermia","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["mechanical thrombectomy","selective brain cooling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mechanical thrombectomy group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional mechanical thrombectomy","interventionNames":["Device: mechanical thrombectomy"]},{"label":"mechanical thrombectomy plus selective brain cooling group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A microcatheter which was used to deploy the stent retriever was threaded into the femoral artery in the groin through a guiding catheter and up through the neck, until it reached beyond the clot causing the stroke under the assistance of micro-guide wire, 50 mL cold 0.9% saline (4°C) was infused into the ischemic territory at 10 mL/min through the microcatheter, thus allowing the cold solution to infuse into the ischemic territory prior to reperfusion.
