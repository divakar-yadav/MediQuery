Post-stroke hand disability impairs stroke survivors' abilities and independence with self-care, hygiene, employment, and leisure, frequently resulting in diminished quality of life. Rehabilitation can often be limited, but research suggests that the effects of therapy is improved by the addition of sensory stimulation.\n\nTo fully leverage the potential therapeutic benefits of sensory stimulation, we have developed a new stimulation that is imperceptible random-frequency vibration applied to wrist skin. The objective of this study is to determine if this treatment is superior to task-practice alone in improving hand functional recovery, sensorimotor grip control, and neural communication."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Physical Disability"],"keywords":["physical stimulation","subliminal stimulation","stroke rehabilitation","physical therapy","occupational therapy","upper extremity","paresis","hand function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vibration","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The device will deliver imperceptible vibration for the treatment group.","interventionNames":["Device: real stimulation"]},{"label":"No Vibration","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The device will deliver no vibration for the control group.","interventionNames":["Device: No stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"real stimulation","description":"Participants will undergo standardized hand task practice therapy (3 sessions/week for 6 weeks) with the watch worn on the paretic wrist.
