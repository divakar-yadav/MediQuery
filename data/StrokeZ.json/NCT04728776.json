The stroke impact scale is a comprehensive self-reported outcome measure designed to assess the quality of life following the stroke. Although the psychometric properties of SIS found to be superior to the conventional generic quality of life scales, it has not been translated and tested in Pakistan.\n\nOBJECTIVE To translate and cross-culturally validate the Urdu version of stroke impact scale 3.0 for Pakistan MATERIAL AND METHODS Established guidelines were followed for translation and adaption of the Stroke impact scale 3.0. A prospective cohort of 116 patients with mild to moderate stroke self-reported their recovery on the Urdu version of SIS 3.0. The patients were concurrently evaluated on the established scales to assess the validity using the Spearman correlation coefficient. ANOVA was used to determine the discriminant validity. Ninety patients were consecutively re-evaluated to determine the test-retest reliability, precision, minimal detectable change (MCD) and clinically minimally important difference. The coefficients of ICC, Cronbach's alpha, and weighted kappa were calculated to establish the stability and consistency of the scale. The receiver operating curve was used to estimate the MCID of SIS-16 using global rating scale as an anchor.\n\nKEYWORDS: Stroke, Stroke Impact Scale, Outcome Measures, Quality of Life"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":116,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 \"Change\" is being assessed","description":"A 59-item self-reported scale with 8 domains, scores of each domain range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate a better health-related quality of life","timeFrame":"Day 1, A week after the first assessment"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale-16 \"Change\" is being assessed","description":"It consists of 16 items of 4 physical function.
