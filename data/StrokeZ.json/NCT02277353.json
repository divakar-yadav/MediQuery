However, its usefulness in prone positioning has not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the usefulness of stroke volume variation (SVV) derived from NICOM® to predict fluid responsiveness in prone patients undergoing spine surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid Responsiveness","Prone Position","Non Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring"],"keywords":["Fluid responsiveness","NICOM","Prone Position","Stroke Volume Variation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"All enrolled patients","description":"This study enrolls patients undergoing elective spine surgery in prone position and all enrolled subjects may receive fluid loading with hemodynamic monitoring by Flotrac/Vigileo and NICOM, but the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the subjects of the study because this is a prospective observational study.","interventionNames":["Other: Fluid loading to evaluate fluid responsiveness"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Fluid loading to evaluate fluid responsiveness","description":"loading of hydroxyethyl starch 6ml/kg over 10-15min to all patients","armGroupLabels":["All enrolled patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke volume variation from NICOM®","description":"predictability of stroke volume variation from NICOM® for fluid responsiveness","timeFrame":"5 min after infusion of bolus fluid"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation from Flotrac/Vigileo system","description":"Correlation with pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation from Flotrac/Vigileo system","timeFrame":"5 min after infusion of bolus fluid"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"TPR (total peripheral resistance), TPRI (total peripheral resistance index)","timeFrame":"5 min after infusion of bolus fluid"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ASA I or II patients undergoing spine surgery in prone position\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pre-existing arrhythmic disorders/moderate to severe valvular heart disease/obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD grade \\>2), left ventricular dysfunction with LV EF less than 50, preoperative need for inotropics or vasopressors\n* BMI \\>30kg/m\\^2 or \\<15kg/m\\^2\n* Preoperative serum Cr \\> 1.3mg/dL\n* Patients with coagulopathy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients undergoing spine surgery under general anesthesia in prone position","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jeong Jin Min, MD","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Samsung Seoul Hospital, Samsung Medical Center","city":"Seoul","zip":"135-710","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
