Some patients with memory problems improve over the first year after stroke, but recovery is unpredictable. The STRATEGIC study assesses patients with recent stroke and follows them up after one year. The study uses cognitive testing and advanced MRI to understand the brain's mechanism for recovery from memory problems and to identify factors that may predict later recovery.","detailedDescription":"Memory breakdown in older age is a major challenge for medical research, with an increasing burden in personal, societal and fiscal terms. Stroke is an important cause. Memory depends on widespread networks in the brain which are bound together by white matter connections, which essentially act as the wiring of brain networks. This project uses a technique called diffusion tensor MRI to investigate these connections and their relationship to brain function and patterns of memory impairment after stroke.\n\nPrevious research showed that a tract called the fornix was most important in the healthy brain and in ageing. However, in individuals at an early stage of memory decline alternative pathways became disproportionately more important. This led to the idea that individuals with early memory decline might be especially vulnerable to injury to these alternative tracts from stroke. The purpose of this project is to test this idea.\n\nThe project focuses on patients with recent stroke. Participants undergo MRI, including diffusion tensor MRI, and in-depth testing of memory and other cognitive functions. The pattern of damage to temporal lobe connections in the brain will be assessed and related to the impact of brain infarction on memory. Analysis will determine how undamaged tracts contribute to recovery over one year. Finally, cutting edge computational image analysis techniques will be applied to try and predict memory profile in more detail and extract maximum information about prognosis from brain images."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Memory Impairment"],"keywords":["Diffusion tensor imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":193,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Patients with recent ischaemic stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score at 30-90 days","description":"The MoCA is a widely used test measuring across several cognitive domains.
