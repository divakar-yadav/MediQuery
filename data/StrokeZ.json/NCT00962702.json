The primary effectiveness outcome is the percentage of patients with complete exclusion of the left atrial appendage assessed peri-operatively (visually), and at 90 days post procedure via transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography will be performed intra-operatively and again at 90 days post procedure. Intra-operative and follow-up TEE examinations will be read centrally at a core laboratory. Any Doppler flow across the Fastener into the excluded portion of the appendage will also be considered a failure of exclusion. The presence or absence of LAA and/or LA thrombus will be evaluated. Patients will also be evaluated for other potential sources of embolism, including aortic atheroma, patent foramen ovale, or other intracardiac shunts.\n\nData collection will be completed at baseline, at the time of open cardiac surgery procedure and throughout the perioperative hospitalization. Patients will be evaluated at 30 days post surgery and at 90 days post surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Exclusion","Left Atrial Appendage","Surgical","Open chest"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exclusion of Left Atrial Appendage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exclusion of Left Atrial Appendage","interventionNames":["Device: LAAx TigerPaw System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"LAAx TigerPaw System","description":"Exclusion of Left Atrial Appendage","armGroupLabels":["Exclusion of Left Atrial Appendage"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The dual primary safety and effectiveness outcomes include the rate of device related adverse and serious adverse events and the extent of complete exclusion of the LAA with minimal residual cavity.","timeFrame":"Patients will be evaluated at 30 days post surgery and at 90 days post surgery."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The extent of complete exclusion of the LAA with minimal residual cavity.","timeFrame":"30 days post surgery and at 90 days post"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
