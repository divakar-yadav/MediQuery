Robotic therapy has been proposed as a viable approach for the rehabilitation of the upper limb, as a way to increase the amount and the intensity of the therapy, and to standardize the treatment. However, robotic technologies have not yet been used to their full potential in terms of tailoring rehabilitation paths and monitoring the response to treatments. The main goal of the study is to use AI algorithms to (a) predict the recovery of the patients and (b) suggest exercises and parameters to improve the outcomes of the treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the robotic group, patients will undergo a 30-session upper limb robotic rehabilitation using the device MOTORE.","interventionNames":["Device: AI-based upper limb robotic therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"AI-based upper limb robotic therapy","description":"Patients will be treated using MOTORE, a robotic device that allows passive, active, and active-assistive planar movements of the shoulder and elbow joints.
