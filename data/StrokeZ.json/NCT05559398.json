Endovascular therapy (EVT) is recommended within 6 hrs of stroke onset, and up to 24 hrs following perfusion imaging criteria.\n\nDespite the major benefit associated with MT, more than 50% of the patients remain disabled at 3 months. Reperfusion rates after MT are critical to determine functional outcome. However, complete reperfusion is obtained in only 50 % of the patients, due to, at least in part, erratic emboli and/or no-reflow processes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of glenzocimab in addition to EVT and compared to EVT plus placebo, whether or not associated with ntravenous thrombolysis (IVT), on functional outcome at day 90."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Platelet glycoprotein VI","Endovascular therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, double blinded, multicentre, placebo controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":260,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Glenzocimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Glenzocimab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Glenzocimab","description":"Glenzocimab (ACT-017, Acticor Biotech) is formulated for IV administration as a sterile product with 20 mM sodium citrate and 130 mM sodium chloride buffer at pH of 5.0.\n\nIt is supplied for clinical trial use in vials containing 50 mL of the drug product at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.\n\nEach vial contains 500 mg of glenzocimab.
