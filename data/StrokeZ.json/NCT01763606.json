These patients are routinely treated with medicines that thin their blood, including enoxaparin or aspirin. However, it is unclear which medicine is best and whether these medicines can be adequately studied in a clinical trial.\n\nThe purpose of this Phase I/II study is to determine if a clinical trial of different blood thinners in patients with cancer and stroke is possible. In addition, the study aims to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of enoxaparin with those of aspirin on patients with cancer and recent stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer Patients First-ever Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Enoxaparin","Aspirin","stroke","12-264"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Enoxaparin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients assigned to enoxaparin.","interventionNames":["Drug: Enoxaparin"]},{"label":"Aspirin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients assigned to Aspirin.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Enoxaparin","description":"Patients will be receive 6 months of subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg BID with a maximum starting dose of 100 mg BID.
