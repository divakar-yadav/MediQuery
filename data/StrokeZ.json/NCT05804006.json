Our study aims to investigate the feasibility of the HIIT program and its effects on functional abilities, cognitive function, and quality of life in early post-stroke.","detailedDescription":"Study design, setting, and ethical considerations:\n\nThis study will be a prospective pre-post study that will be conducted at the university hospital of Parakou in Benin. The study protocol will be submitted to the ethics committee of Hasselt University in Belgium and the local biomedical ethics committee of the University of Parakou, Republic of Benin.\n\nInterventions:\n\nThe experimental protocol will be preceded by 30 minutes of conventional physiotherapy, including neuromuscular interventions (balance training, postural awareness), musculoskeletal interventions (passive range of motion, stretching, strengthening), and lower-intensity overground walking. The conventional physiotherapy will be followed by 15 min of the rest period, then the experimental protocol consisting of a HIIT program on a recumbent cycle SOLE R92 (HIIT-REC) will be performed three times per week for six successive weeks.21 Training will be performed on non-consecutive days, thereby permitting recovery between sessions. The HIIT procedure will start at 4-min at 30% of the peak workload interspersed with 1-min at 70% of the peak workload at 50 rpm for weeks 1-2 and increased by approximately 5 minutes every two weeks as tolerated to reach 30 minutes from week 5 (4 to 6 repetitions). The training intensity will progress similarly by 5% peak workload two weeks as tolerated to reach 4-min at 40% peak workload interspersed with 1-min 80% peak workload from week-5.22 All sessions will be supervised and performed individually with verbal encouragement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Conventional physiotherapy followed by High-Intensity Interval training on the semi-recumbent bike","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HIIT-REC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-intensity interval training program on a recumbent cycle SOLE R92 (HIIT-REC)","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physiotherapy followed by HIIT-REC program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional physiotherapy followed by HIIT-REC program","description":"The experimental protocol will be preceded by 30 minutes of conventional physiotherapy followed by 15 min the rest period; then the HIIT-REC procedure will start at 4-min at 30% of the peak workload interspersed with 1-min at 70% of the peak workload at 50 rpm for weeks 1-2 and increased by approximately 5 minutes every two weeks as tolerated to reach 30 minutes from week 5 (4 to 6 repetitions).
