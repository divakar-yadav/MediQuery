The primary endpoint is early neurological deterioration (END) before discharge.","detailedDescription":"Anticoagulation therapy is effective to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF who have a history of stroke. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that early initiation of anticoagulation therapy after AIS is safe, while no remarkable benefits have been observed. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness between early and late initiation of anticoagulation therapy in AIS patients with non-NVAF. Participants will be 1:1 randomized into early or late initiation group. The primary endpoint is END before discharge."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Atrial
