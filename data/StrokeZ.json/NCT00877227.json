Increased homocysteine concentrations are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents in adult, children and newborns. These increased concentrations can easily and safely be lowered by folic acid in adults.","detailedDescription":"The incidence of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) occurring perinatally is relatively high and aspects of the multifactorial pathophysiology remain unclear. Elevated homocysteine concentrations are shown to be associated with an increased risk for CVA in newborns. We want to study the possible homocysteine lowering effect of folinic acid in newborns.\n\nWe will include newborns in our prospective randomized folinic acid intervention study from patients admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. We will measure total homocysteine (tHcy) and folate concentrations at three time points. The intervention group will be treated with folinic acid (70 Âµg/kg/day) for two weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mild Hyperhomocysteinemia"],"keywords":["CVA","stroke","newborns","homocysteine","folinic acid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"folinic acid","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Folinic acid was given for two weeks as 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (10 mg/ml) (Pharmachemie bv).
