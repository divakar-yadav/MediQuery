An MRI is performed at baseline. At the day of surgery, patients is randomized to closure/left open left atrial appendage.\n\nDuring surgery, a maximum of 15 ml blood and a right atrium biopsy are taken for further analyses. Additionally, a biopsy of the left atrium appendage is collected from the group of patients randomized for closure.\n\nThe study group recommend a double closure. After discharge a second MRI is performed and the final MRI is performed after a minimum of six months.\n\nThe final contact with the patient is done one year after surgery at the earliest. Where a clinical interview is done over the phone and the patients clinical records are screened for cerebral ischaemic events and atrial fibrillation.\n\nDuring the study period, some patients are elected for a bicycle stress test to test for levels of neurohormones, and some are elected for monitoring with Holter.\n\nThere will also be performed transesophageal echocardiography on interested patients in order to test for the quality of surgical closure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Cerebral Embolism","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":205,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"On the control group is done MRI scans of the brain, and patients can be elected for monitoring and/or bicycle stress test to test for neurohormones."},{"label":"Surgical Closure","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"During open heart surgery, the surgeon closes the left atrial appendage.
