Feasibility will be tested in the clinical environment by providing the intervention, measuring patient outcomes, and identifying the obstacles to insurance payment for the QualPro intervention. By productively addressing issues of implementation, the hypotheses of this study include proven feasibility in the clinical environment and clinically significant gains for stroke patients in the areas of strength, balance, gait coordination, endurance, physical function, and increased life role participation.","detailedDescription":"This comprehensive intervention targets the impairments preventing recovery to normal and safe gait, mobility, function, and life role participation (quality of life). It has been tested in chronic stroke survivors and found efficacious.\n\nThe QualPro protocol will include three phases, all of which contain components previously mentioned. The QualPro protocol includes implementation of gait coordination training to address weakness, impaired endurance, and dyscoordination. The protocol will include implementation of balance training for falls prevention composed of Yang style, 24-posture, short-form Tai Chi. Additionally, the QualPro protocol will include implementation of aerobic training for fitness, health, and endurance of stroke survivors, which will be composed of low-volume, high intensity interval training (HIIT) on a cycle ergometer. Strength exercises will also be included. All exercises will address weakness, impaired endurance, and dyscoordination.\n\nThe long-range financial goal of this research study is to realize the cost savings of implementing the proposed combination of interventions that will preclude much of the very costly and downwardly spiraling sequellae currently observed after stroke, and that currently costs managed care and insurance companies an exorbitant and unnecessary amount of precious resources."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","stroke rehabilitation","stroke therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of Care, Sub-Acute","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive standard of care stroke rehabilitation therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard of Care, Sub-Acute"]},{"label":"Standard of Care, Chronic","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive standard of care stroke rehabilitation therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard of Care, Chronic"]},{"label":"Experimental Group, Sub-Acute","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group consists of sub-acute stroke patients who are between three weeks and six months post-stroke and will receive the QualPro protocol.
