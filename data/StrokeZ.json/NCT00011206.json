Follow-up and analysis has continued on the 361,662 men screened and the 12,866 men randomized.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nThe National Death Index (NDI) will be used for continued follow-up of the MRFIT cohorts. An additional assay to establish IGF-1 and IGF binding protein will be added to the data set as a potential prognostic factor. The effort will focus on three primary aims related to long-term mortality. Aim 1 will relate nutritional-dietary data to twenty-five year mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), colon cancer, prostate cancer, and all causes for the 12,866 men randomized. Aim 2 will relate age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, geographic location, major risk factors, low risk status, prior diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction to twenty-five year mortality for the 361,662 men screened. Aim 3 will relate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein, and fasting and one-hour glucose measurements from frozen baseline sera to mortality for the 12,866 men randomized."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Coronary Disease","Myocardial Ischemia","Diabetes Mellitus","Cerebrovascular Accident","Myocardial Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"No eligibility criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"James Neaton","affiliation":"University of Minnesota","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"12020303","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Domanski M, Mitchell G, Pfeffer M, Neaton JD, Norman J, Svendsen K, Grimm R, Cohen J, Stamler J; MRFIT Research Group.
