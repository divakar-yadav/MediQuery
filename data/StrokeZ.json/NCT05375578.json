The WQ is in English Language the name of the author of WQ is Van der Ham Et al and firstly introduced in 2013. The reliability of this English tool is 0.70 to 0.80 it has been translated in various Languages i.e Hungarian, Dutch and Chinese and suffering from stroke. But it was not translated in Urdu Language. No such study has been previously conducted in Pakistan region which translates the scale and follows the proper cross-cultural adaptation","detailedDescription":"For resolving such problem WQ play pivotal role in accessing navigation problem of stroke patients it is a very reliable tool for accessing navigation issue. The scale consists of 22 items. All the items dated from 01 to 07 in which stroke patients are accessed. The patients who are taken in the study age from 18 to 65 years. As the WQ is a well-developed measurement scale for accessing navigation in stroke patients. It is meaningful to validate its Urdu version. The translation and cultural adaptation process would start after obtaining approval from the developer of the original WQ. This would be done according to bitten guidelines. The purpose will be to gain uniformity in the translation of both the target Language and source Language. This will involve 5 steps which is forward translation, synthesis 1, back translation, synthesis 2 and pallet testing. The second step would be done according to the Beaton guidelines in which psychometric properties will be measured that is internal consistency, test retest reliability, Discriminant validity, Convergent Validity, Content Validity and Factor analysis"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Way finding Questionnaire, Navigation, Cognition."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wayfinding Questionnaire","description":"For resolving such problem WQ play pivotal role in accessing navigation problem of stroke patients it is a very reliable tool for accessing navigation issue.
