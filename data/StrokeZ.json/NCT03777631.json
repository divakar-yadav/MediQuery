Although anticoagulant therapy can effectively reduce thromboembolic events, the reported annual recurrence rate in NVAF and previous stroke patients in the \"real-world\" is not low even with appropriate antithrombotic treatment; 8.6% in patients with \"guideline adherent\" antithrombotic therapy and around 5% in patients treated with anticoagulant therapy. NVAF and recent stroke is high-risk population for stroke recurrence even with anticoagulant therapy, and developing optimal secondary prevention strategy is an urgent task.\n\nCatheter ablation (CA) is now widely used to treat symptoms related to NVAF. Some retrospective studies showed a beneficial effect of CA for stroke prevention using age-/sex-matching or propensity-score matching. Moreover, CA have a potential to improve survival or prevent heart failure development in patients with AF. However, the effect of CA for secondary stroke prevention or impact of CA for NVAF patients with recent ischemic stroke for survival or developing heart failure has not been evaluated in a prospective randomized trial. Therefore, in the present study, we intend to compare two groups of patients with NVAF with a history of cerebral infarction: a group receiving standard medical therapy (control group) and a group receiving standard medical therapy plus CA (CA group)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation Non-Rheumatic"],"keywords":["anticoagulation treatment","catheter ablation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The included patients were randomly allocated to two groups: (1) Standard medical treatment group and (2) Catheter ablation additional group.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":251,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard medical therapy group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The preferred anticoagulant is edoxaban.
