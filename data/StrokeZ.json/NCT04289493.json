It will be a randomized, crossed over, interventional pilot study recruiting 54 patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia. Patients will be treated individually in 40-minute sessions twice a week for 8 weeks. In each session, a speech therapist and an actor will select the clips with muted words or sentences that have been detected as functionally meaningful for each patient. Outcomes will be assessed as significant differences in two aphasia tests.","detailedDescription":"The DULCINEA study aims to develop and validate a new therapy that integrates essential language characteristics and functional communication by dubbing scenes from TV series that represent daily situations. It will be a randomized, crossed over, interventional pilot study recruiting 54 patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia from the departments of Neurology and Rehabilitation from La Paz University Hospital and also from the \"Afasia Activa\" association. After meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and signing informed consent, patients will be randomised (1:1) in two different treatment groups. The first group will receive therapy within the first 3 months of their inclusion with a subsequent period of another 3 months without therapy (thus, serving as group 2 controls). Group 2 will initiate therapy after 3 months since their inclusion (serving as group 1 controls during the first 3 months). Therapy consists of 17 sessions performed in a eight week period (1 baseline session and 16 dubbing sessions), each lasting 40 minutes, in which the patient will be asked to dubb words or sentences previously selected and considered as functionally meaningful for them. These words will be chosen through an online survey performed by a representative group of aphasic patients and the study patients´own relatives in the baseline treatment session. Outcomes will be assessed as significant differences in two aphasia tests (CAL questionnaire and the BDAE)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia, Post-Ictal"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Word dubbing","Functional communication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups with 27 patients in each one.
