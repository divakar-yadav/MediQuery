However, perioperative changes in cerebral hemodynamics can induce fluctuations in cerebral perfusion that may lead to transient or irreversible neurological deficits. Our preliminary single-center study suggests that postoperative intravenous administration of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) may alleviate perioperative neurological deficits and improve the neurological outcomes after EC-IC revascularization for MMD. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, single-controlled, add-on to standard of care study of NBP in patients with MMD of high risk for ischemic cerebrovascular events after EC-IC revascularization surgery.","detailedDescription":"This trial is a prospective, randomized, singe-blinded, placebo parallel controlled, multiple-center trial.\n\nA total of approximately 450 patients (age between18 years and 60 years) with moyamoya disease after EC-IC revascularization will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive butylphthalide in 100 mL of normal saline twice daily since the day of surgery and continued for 14 postoperative days; 2) the other group will receive 100 mL of normal saline twice daily since the day of surgery and continued for 14 postoperative days.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate the rate and severity of ischemic cerebral event in MMD patients with butylphthalide after EC-IC bypass surgery. The study consists of four visits including the day of randomization(baseline), postoperative day 1 before the first injection, 14 days after surgery when the injection therapy is done, and 30 after suryery. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment, neurological function scale will be recorded during the program. The rate of stroke event, neurological deficit and severity of neurological deficits will be assessed by modified Rankin scale. The trial is anticipated to last from January 2020 to December 2022 with subjects recruited form two neurosurgical centers in Beijing, China."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Moyamoya Disease","Ischemic Cerebral Infarction","Ischemic Stroke","Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accident","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["Dl-3-n-butylphthalide","Revascularization surgery","Extracranial-to-intracranial revascularization","Direct bypass surgery","Combined bypass surgery","Indirect bypass surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":450,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Butylphthalide (NBP)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"For patients without obvious intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan at 4 hours after surgery, 25 mg of NBP in 100 mL of normal saline was administered intravenously since the day of surgery and continued twice daily for 14 postoperative days.","interventionNames":["Drug: dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP)"]},{"label":"Normal saline","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"For patients without obvious intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan at 4 hours after surgery, 100 mL of normal saline was administered intravenously since the day of surgery and continued twice daily for 14 postoperative days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Normal Saline 0.9% Infusion Solution"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP)","description":"25 mg of NBP in 100 mL of normal saline was administered intravenously since the day of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery and continued twice daily for 14 postoperative days.","armGroupLabels":["Butylphthalide (NBP)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Normal Saline 0.9% Infusion Solution","description":"100 mL of normal saline was administered intravenously since the day of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery and continued twice daily for 14 postoperative days.","armGroupLabels":["Normal saline"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Perioperative ischemic stroke rate","description":"Perioperative cerebral stroke was defined as a symptomatic event of new cerebral infarction within 30 days after surgery and confirmed by CT or MRI.
