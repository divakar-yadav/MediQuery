Stroke individuals face some limitations in managing daily activities such as walking, dressing, feeding and showering. Personal, environmental, and societal limitations have led to the development of new treatment strategies, such as telerehabilitation(TR), to meet the needs of stroke individuals and their caregivers.\n\nIn this study, patients will be randomized and divided into 2 groups in order to examine the effects of two different TR methods on physical parameters and activities of daily living in stroke patients. Baseline assessments will be made for both groups to determine functionality, activities of daily living, fall activity, quality of life, and level of fatigue. For 8 weeks, the TR group will do their exercises with exercise videos prepared on the system 3 times a week. The control group, on the other hand, will do their exercises with exercise brochures on the system 3 times a week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, assessments will be repeated. With telerehabilitation to be applied to individuals with stroke, it is aimed to increase functional capacity, independence in daily living activities and quality of life, and reduce the number of falls and fatigue levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Telerehabilitation","Home-based","Physiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telerehabilitation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will perform their exercises with pre-prepared personalized exercise videos over the telerehabilitation system 3 times a week for 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Home-based Telerehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will perform exercises with personalized exercise brochures defined over the telerehabilitation system 3 times a week for 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Exercise Brochure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home-based Telerehabilitation","description":"Balance, walking, strengthening exercise videos etc. taken in different positions will be uploaded to the telerehabilitation system.
