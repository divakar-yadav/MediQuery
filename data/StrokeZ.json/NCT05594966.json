Cerebral small vessel disease(CVSD) is refer as the main resource of delirium among elderly people. In the study, CVSD will be diagnosed using multimodal MRI. And we want to select a high correlating COPD biomarker through CyTOF. We also want to investigate a medical model to select the high risk patients who may suffer from POCD after cardiac surgery.","detailedDescription":"This study will investigate whether preoperative CSVD and CyTOF will help to predict the occurencce of Postoprative Cognitive Dysfunction(POCD) in 1 year after surgery. The investigators perform a prospective cohort study among selective cardiac surgery patients between 50 to 85 years old. All participates have pre-operative head multimodel MRI in Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University. Incusion and exclusion criteria and relevant data were collected. Patients' age, gender, specific surgical methods, educational background, BMI, tobacco and alcohol history, and systematic medical history were collected before surgery, specific history (heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, cornoary artery stent implantation, and history of cardiac surgery), medical history (blood pressure medication, anti-arrhythmic drugs, diuresis, anti-arrhythemic drugs, diuresis, anticoagulant drugs), laboratory examination, auxiliary examination(blood routine, blood coagulation, liver and kidney function, etc.), and Cognitive Function Assessment Scale(MMSE, MOCA, ADL, GDSS). Perioperative indicators were also collected, including use of anesthetics, anestetic time,vital signs, etc. Blood sample should be taken before and after surgery. Postopeative data including: POD whithin 5 days after surgery, cardiovascular drugs use in ICU, mechanical ventilation time, length of stay in ICU, occurrence of complicatiosns of patients, Cognitive function Assessment Scale 1 year after surgery. POD was assessed by a professionally trained clinician twice daily at 8-12 hour intervals, using CAM-ICU scale, if diagnosis with POD, DRS-98 is used to evaluate th severity of POD. POCD was assessed by a professionally trained clinican at 1 year after surgery. The incidence of POD and POCD was analyzed between groups, and the association between each index and delirium and POCD was analyzed by logistic regresssion. The waste blood from routine peripheral blood examination was collected before operation, at the end of operation, on the second day after operation and one year after opertion for the detection of biomarkers by CyTOF, and the composite model of MRI and biomarkers was established."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction","Postoperative Delirium","Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Covert Postoperative Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"5 ml peripheral venous blood samples will be taken before and after the surgery.
