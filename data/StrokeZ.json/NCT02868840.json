Tai Chi addresses the integration and balance of mind and body using the fundamental principles of slow, smooth, and continuous movement control, and the transfer of body weight while maintaining an upright and relaxed posture. The present randomized clinical trial project aims to apply the suggested principles as the typical features of Tai Chi applied stroke rehabilitation, and to evaluate the effects on physical (balance), psychological, and cognitive function.","detailedDescription":"Cerebrovascular disease is a major global concern. The individuals with stroke would suffer from disease associated symptoms which influence their functioning in everyday life. These symptom clusters were usually known to be sharing similar underlying mechanisms. It is clear that the development of effective stroke rehabilitation involves interdisciplinary team approach to manage physical, social, cognitive, and psychological functioning in this population.\n\nTai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, is a low intense aerobic exercise characterized by continuous movements that embrace the mind, body, and spirit. Tai Chi addresses the integration and balance of mind and body using the fundamental principles of slow, smooth, and continuous movement control, and the transfer of body weight while maintaining an upright and relaxed posture. The newly developed style of Tai Chi for health programs is the seated Tai Chi, which shares the common Tai Chi principles while being modified to adjust the movements for patients with limited mobility.\n\nThe present randomized clinical trial project aims to apply the suggested principles as the typical features of Tai Chi applied stroke rehabilitation, and to evaluate the effects on physical (balance), psychological, and cognitive function. Only a few studies ever addressed the feasibility of Tai Chi for stroke rehabilitation, and the relationship between cognition and balance in this population is still very early stage of investigation. The main purpose of our collaborating project is to explore the direct relationship between cognition and balance in stroke patients during their rehabilitation process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Tai ji","postural balance","cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tai Chi group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tai Chi exercise, twice a week, one hour per session. participated in Tai Chi either while seated or standing upon their comfort level.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Tai Chi exercise"]},{"label":"Symptom management group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"manage stroke symptom through phone and text message along with other rehabilitation therapy.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: symptom management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Tai Chi exercise","description":"exercise twice a week each for one hour","armGroupLabels":["Tai Chi group"],"otherNames":["seated Tai Chi"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"symptom management","description":"sending text message weekly to manage symptoms related to stroke","armGroupLabels":["Symptom management group"],"otherNames":["message counselling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"balance","description":"postural stability test will be measured by standard computerized test","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"activities of daily living","description":"activities of daily living will be measured by Modified rankin scale","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months"},{"measure":"knee muscle strength","description":"knee flexor and extensor strength by isokinetic testing measured by Biodex","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"cognition","description":"measured by Korean version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosed as stroke at least for 3 months upto 2 years\n* eligible to participate rehabilitation therapy referred by primary physician\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* not able to understand questionnaires\n* not able to stand alone for balance test","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Rhayun Song, PhD","affiliation":"Chungnam National University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chungnam National University Hospital","city":"Daejeon","zip":"35015","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":36.32139,"lon":127.41972}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"26291978","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Chen BL, Guo JB, Liu MS, Li X, Zou J, Chen X, Zhang LL, Yue YS, Wang XQ.
