These problems may accelerate the disability process during aging. It is well known that exercise helps to maintain or promote human fitness. This study is conducted to explore the beneficial effects of exercise and protein supplement on fitness and body composition among patients with chronic stroke.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicenter randomized control trial. Participants will be recruited from 4 teaching hospitals in Taipei. Participants are randomly assigned to 2 groups:\n\n1. protein supplementation + exercise (PRO group);\n2. carbohydrate supplementation + exercise (CHO group);\n\nThe 1-hour exercise intervention includes aerobic cycling exercise followed by progressive resisted exercise with TheraBand. PRO group receives PS immediately before and after the exercise while the CHO group receive sham product (the same calories with no protein). The Interventions are arranged 3 sessions a week for 10 weeks. The outcome measurements are performed at 0-week, 10-week, and 20-week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":114,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PRO group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in PRO group receive dietary supplementation with protein-rich supplements immediately before and after each exercise training session.
