Women present a higher incidence of this pathology and prevalence of its risk factors. Similarly, after stroke, women have a poorer functional outcome, higher rates of institutionalization and greater dependence on activities of daily living. People who have suffered a stroke are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, with an estimated one-third of stroke survivors suffering a new event in the following 5 years. Current scientific literature recommends the promotion of physical activity (PA) and exercise for the prevention of stroke and its sequelae. However, stroke survivors are often insufficiently active. Therefore, changing their behavior with respect to PA and sedentary lifestyle is fundamental. Moreover, gender perspective, should also taken into account.\n\nThus, our aims are to study whether there are differences in women with chronic stroke sequelae compared to men in: 1) the amount of sitting time and its context, as well as the time spent in different intensities of PA; 2) the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health after the completion of the PA self-management program and sedentary lifestyle developed in this project; 3) the presence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis and the state of frailty.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the lifestyle habits of 128 subjects (64 women) who live in the community and have chronic sequelae of stroke (≥ 6 months) will be evaluated. In addition, possible differences in the study variables will be verified with control people without sequelae of stroke. Moreover, in order to reduce the risks of stroke survivors, a program of self-management of PA and sedentary lifestyle will be developed. This program will be carried out through several sessions spread over six months that will incorporate: education, goal setting, identification of barriers, self-control and feedback. The feasibility of this intervention will be determined by examining compliance, duration, utility, and safety. At least 64 of the previously studied subjects will participate in this program, analyzing whether it favors the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health thanks to the measurement of different physical capacities. The differences between men and women in response to the program will be determined. Finally, we will explore whether the effect of the program is greater when it is implemented in the subacute than in the chronic phase."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Sequelae"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized clinical trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Self-management group to increase physical activity levels","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will perform a self-management program along 6 months.
