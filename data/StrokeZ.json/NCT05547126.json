The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants will be submitted to three sessions, each session consisting of a different condition, namely: anodic tDCS - participants who will receive real current over the primary motor area; Dualsite tDCS - participants who will receive real current over the primary motor area and over the dorsolateral prefrontal area (DLPFC) and simulated tDCS - participants who will receive simulated stimulation. Participants will receive 3 tDCS sessions, lasting 20 minutes, associated with a physical therapy protocol based on dual motor and cognitive tasks, on alternate days (3 times a week). On each intervention day, pre and post-intervention assessments will be carried out, the evaluated outcomes will be: functional connectivity (EEG), functional mobility (Timed Up and Go) and executive functions (Trail-making Test A and B, the Clock Drawing Test and Phonemic Verbal Fluency Test). Statistical performance will be performed using SPSS software (Version 20.0) and MATLAB 9.20 with a significance level of p\\<0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Transcranial direct current stimulation","Stroke","Dual-task training","EEG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal tDCS + dual-task training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The anodic electrode (5x5 cm) will be applied to the primary motor area (C3/C4) ipsilateral to the lesion and the reference electrode (6x9 cm) to the deltoid muscle region.\n\nSimultaneously with the tDCS sessions, participants will be submitted a protocol based on motor and cognitive dual-task training.
