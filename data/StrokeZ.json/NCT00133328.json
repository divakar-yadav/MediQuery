However, it is a problem that the number of Asian patients is very little in these trials. The researchers examine the treatment meaning by ARB about the prognosis of the patient who amalgamates either among high blood pressure, the ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Ischemic Heart Disease","Congestive Heart Failure"],"keywords":["stroke","myocardial infarction","angina","renal damage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"valsartan"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke"},{"measure":"new or recurrent transient ischemic attack"},{"measure":"new or recurrent acute myocardial infarction"},{"measure":"new occurrence or exacerbation of heart failure"},{"measure":"new occurrence or exacerbation angina pectoris"},{"measure":"dissecting aneurysm of the aorta"},{"measure":"lower limb arterial obstruction"},{"measure":"transition to dialysis"},{"measure":"doubling of plasma creatinine (Cr) levels"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"death from any cause"},{"measure":"left ventricular hypertrophy"},{"measure":"changes in ECG"},{"measure":"proteinuria"},{"measure":"B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)"},{"measure":"heart failure symptoms"},{"measure":"heart failure syndrome (edema, rales on auscultation)"},{"measure":"blood pressure and heart rate"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy\n* Severe renal damage\n* Severe liver damage\n* Acute myocardial infarction","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"79 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Seibu Mochizuki, MD., PhD","affiliation":"The Jikei University School of Medicine","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"The Jikei University School of Medicine","city":"Tokyo","zip":"105-8461","country":"Japan","geoPoint":{"lat":35.6895,"lon":139.69171}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"15367828","type":"RESULT","citation":"Mochizuki S, Shimizu M, Taniguchi I, Kanae K, Yoshida S, Tajima N, Dahlof B; JIKEI HEART Study Group.
