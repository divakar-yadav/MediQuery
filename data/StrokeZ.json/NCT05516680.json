Antidepressants are the first-line treatment for PSD, but many reported side effects remain. Clinical research and practice guidelines have shown that electro-acupuncture and rTMS have a positive effect on PSD. This trial aims to study the efficacy and safety of electro-acupuncture and a modern MRI-navigated rTMS for PSD and to explore its fMRI-based central mechanism on depression. It is hypothesized that electro-acupuncture and MRI-navigated rTMS treatment improves depressive symptoms, neuro-patho-physiological behaviors, quality of life and central response in PSD.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn this randomized, controlled, assessors-blinded trial, sixty-four patients with PSD will be randomly allocated into the experiment group (n=32) or control group(n=32) . The experiment group will receive electro-acupuncture and MRI-navigated rTMS, and the control group will receive MRI-navigated rTMS treatment, in 12-20 sessions over 4 weeks. In addition, ten healthy people for fMRI scanning will be recruited as a healthy control group without any intervention. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Scale-24 items (HAMD-24) scores at week 4. The primary analysis of central mechanism mainly involves cortical morphology, local spontaneous brain activity, and default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity based on fMRI at 0-wk and 4-wk. Secondary outcomes include the neuro-patho-physiological and quality of life changes in cortical excitability with motor evoked potential test(MEP), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS), EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire(EQ-5D) Scale, Modified Barthel Index(MBI) Scale and Short Form-Health Scale of Traditional Chinese Medicine(SF-HSTCM). Additional indicators include the Acceptability Questionnaire and Health Economics Evaluation (cost-effectiveness analysis) to assess acceptability and economic practicality of the treatment in study. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and post intervention.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nElectro-acupuncture and MRI-navigated rTMS therapy could become an alternative treatment for PSD, and it is expected that this trial will provide reliable clinical evidence and potential effect mechanism for the future use of electro-acupuncture and MRI-navigated rTMS for PSD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Depression","Healthy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experiment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"electro-acupuncture and MRI-navigated rTMS","interventionNames":["Device: electro-acupuncture","Device: MRI-navigated rTMS"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"MRI-navigated rTMS","interventionNames":["Device: MRI-navigated rTMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"electro-acupuncture","description":"Acupoints consist of Neiguan (PC6, bilateral), Shuigou (GV26), Sanyinjiao (SP6, affected side), Yintang (EX-HN3), Shangxing (GV23), Baihui (GV20), and Sishencong (EX-HN1).

Left DLPFC localization was central middle frontal gyrus,between superior frontal sulcus and middle frontal sulcus based on T1-weighted anatomical images.Focal rTMS was administered using a Magstim Rapid 2 connected to Y125-round coil that was identical.rTMS was applied at 110% RMT to the left DLPFC.At each session,3000 pulses were applied at 10 Hz with a total of 12-20 rTMS sessions over a 4-week period.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experiment group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hamilton Depression Scale-24 items scores","description":"Reduction rate","timeFrame":"change from baseline to week 4"},{"measure":"fMRI scan","description":"Cortical morphology, local spontaneous brain activity, and default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity","timeFrame":"0 week"},{"measure":"fMRI scan","description":"Cortical morphology, local spontaneous brain activity, and default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"motor evoked potential test","description":"Cortical excitability","timeFrame":"0 week"},{"measure":"motor evoked potential test","description":"Cortical excitability","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale","description":"The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 42 points, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"0 week"},{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale","description":"The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 42 points, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire Scale","description":"The minimum and maximum values of utility index are -0.391 and 1 points, and higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"0 week"},{"measure":"EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire Scale","description":"The minimum and maximum values of utility index are -0.391 and 1 points, and higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index Scale","description":"The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 100 points, and higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"0 week"},{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index Scale","description":"The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 100 points, and higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Short Form-Health Scale of Traditional Chinese Medicine","description":"The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 130 points, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"0 week"},{"measure":"Short Form-Health Scale of Traditional Chinese Medicine","description":"The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 130 points, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Acceptability Questionnaire","description":"It is involved three levels: \"fully accepted\", \"acceptable\" and \"not acceptable\".
