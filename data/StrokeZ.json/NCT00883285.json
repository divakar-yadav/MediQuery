AVR techniques include the conventional technique, the transfemoral and the transapical approach. Before the intervention CT of the chest is performed preoperatively to assess the degree of aortic and aortic valve calcification. Patients undergo MRI of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and neurological assessment (NIHSS score) within 48 h before and after the procedure to assess occurrence of cerebral embolism."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke","Aortic Valve Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"conventional aortic valve replacement"},{"label":"2","description":"transfemoral aortic valve replacement"},{"label":"3","description":"transapical aortic valve replacement"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Silent cerebral embolism","timeFrame":"48 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Apparent cerebral embolism","timeFrame":"48 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* aortic valve replacement\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* contraindication to undergo MRI","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with aortic valve disease","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of Bonn","city":"Bonn","state":"NRW","zip":"53105","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":50.73438,"lon":7.09549}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28547872","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Doerner J, Kupczyk PA, Wilsing M, Luetkens JA, Storm K, Fimmers R, Hickethier T, Eichhorn L, Naehle CP, Schild HH, Werner N, Nickenig G, Ghanem A.
