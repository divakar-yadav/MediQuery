A minimum of 34 patients who have suffered an ischeamic or haemorrhagic stroke and who suffer from fatigue, will be recruited and randomised to receive a 6-week programme of either RIC or a sham intervention.","detailedDescription":"Up to 75% of stroke patients suffer from fatigue, the effect of which can be physical, cognitive or emotional, and presents a large barrier to progressing rehabilitation.\n\nRemote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a procedure whereby ischaemia is induced to a limb for short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to above systolic pressures (mmHg). This procedure is performed for periods that avoid physical injury to the limbs, but induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such changes often result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the body, as well as improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. This may enhance the physical abilities of patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke, particularly when aiming to improve endurance and fatigue."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Fatigue"],"keywords":["remote ischaemic conditioning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Remote Ischaemic Conditioning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"4 cycles of 5 minutes of upper or lower (depending on tolerability) limb ischaemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion.

To analyse GPAQ data, metabolic equivalents (METs) are used to express the intensity of physical activities. MET is the ratio of a person's working relative to resting metabolic rate. Higher MET values indicate more intense activity. MET values are applied to time variables according to the intensity of the activity, 4 METS for time spent in moderate activities and 8 METS for vigorous activities. Mean/median time of physical activity on average per day is calculated by summing MET scores for all domains to calculate average activity per week, and dividing this score by 7 (p1t3+p4t6+p7t9+p10t12+p13t15)/7).
