Compared to NMDA antagonists or antioxidants, improved efficacy and therapeutic time window of Neu2000 have been well documented in four animal models of stroke. Notable Safety of Neu2000 has been demonstrated in 168 human subjects conducted in the US and China as well as animals.\n\nIn the present phase II study, patients with acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours of onset would be assigned randomly to one of four groups as follows:\n\n* Group A receiving 2.75g Neu2000KWL for 5 days\n* Group B receiving 5.25g Neu2000KWL for 5 days\n* Group C receiving 6.00g Neu2000KWL for 5 days\n* Group D receiving placebo for 5 days\n\nPatients will receive intravenous infusion of the clinical study drug twice a day at 12±1 hour intervals for 5 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Stroke","the Salfaprodil for injection","Neu2000KWL","Neuroprotection","glutamate","free radical"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Double Blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":236,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neu2000KWL 2750mg dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Low dose group","interventionNames":["Drug: Neu2000KWL"]},{"label":"Neu2000KWL 5250mg dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Middle dose group","interventionNames":["Drug: Neu2000KWL"]},{"label":"Neu2000KWL 6000mg dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High dose group","interventionNames":["Drug: Neu2000KWL"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebos"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Neu2000KWL","description":"1st infusion of 500mg in patients within 6 hours following ischemic stroke onset followed by 9 consecutive infusions of 250 mg at intervals of 12 hours","armGroupLabels":["Neu2000KWL 2750mg dose group"],"otherNames":["Salfaprodil for injection"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Neu2000KWL","description":"1st infusion of 750mg in patients within 6 hours following ischemic stroke onset followed by 9 consecutive infusions of 500 mg at intervals of 12 hours","armGroupLabels":["Neu2000KWL 5250mg dose group"],"otherNames":["Salfaprodil for injection"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Neu2000KWL","description":"1st infusion of 1500mg in patients within 6 hours following ischemic stroke onset followed by 9 consecutive infusions of 500 mg at intervals of 12 hours","armGroupLabels":["Neu2000KWL 6000mg dose group"],"otherNames":["Salfaprodil for injection"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebos","description":"1st infusion of the same volume of saline in patients within 6 hours following ischemic stroke onset followed by 9 consecutive infusions of the same volume of saline at intervals of 12 hours","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The ratio of patients with NIHSS score of 0-1 or with reduction of NIHSS score of ≥4 than the baseline on 14 ± 2 day following the first injection.","description":"The ratio of patients with NIHSS score of 0-1 or with reduction of NIHSS score of ≥4 than the baseline on 14 ± 2 day following the first injection.","timeFrame":"days:14±2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from the baseline in NIHSS score on 14 ± 2, 30 ± 2 and 90 ± 7 days following the first injection. 1.
