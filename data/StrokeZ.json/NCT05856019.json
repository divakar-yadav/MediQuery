It is caused by the loss of planter fascia flexibility that leads to mechanical overloading of fascial structures. There are some risk factors that are important to consider include age, leg length difference, inadequate footwear, inappropriate walking and running patterns and increased planter fascia thickness. Planter fascia thickness more than 4mm can be considered as an indicative of planter fasciitis.\n\nMyofascial soft tissue mobilization is a low load, long duration stretch to the myofascial complex technique that is given in both acute and chronic conditions which in caused by tightness and soft tissue restriction in the patients with planter fasciitis to restore length, decrease pain and to improve function.\n\nCupping therapy on gastrocnemius is a medical technique that applies negative pressure over pain areas and pressure points that alleviates pain and improve blood circulation. it could be low-cost and convenient alternative technique to treat planter fasciitis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Plantar Fascitis"],"keywords":["planter fascitis","J stroke myofascial release","Ischemic release on gastrocnemius"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"J Stroke Myofascial Release","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient is in prone lying position with foot supported.
