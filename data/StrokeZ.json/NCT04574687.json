It is a Randomized Control Trial. Patients will be selected by Consecutive Sampling from Ittefaq Hospital Trust, Lahore. All patients were right handed prior to stroke. Screening tools used will be Canadian Neurological Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Bell Barrage test, and the ideomotor apraxia test (SpinnlerRognoni).Tests for assessment will be Fugl-Meyer test (FM) (of the upper limb), Frenchay Arm test (FAT), Box and Block test (BBT), Modified Ashworth Scale (AS) and Functional Independence Measure Motor items (FIMM). The SPSS version 21 will be used for analyzing data. The descriptive data will be expressed in Frequency and Percentages, while within the group differences will be measured by Mixed Model Anova."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurodevelopmental Techniques","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional treatment protocol including active and active-assissted ROM exercises.
