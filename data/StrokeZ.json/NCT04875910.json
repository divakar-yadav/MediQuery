A good rehabilitation program may not be accessible for all individuals living with stroke due to cost, transportation and compliance. Telerehabilitation is an alternative health care program that has been used to provide therapy for stroke survivors living in rural areas. With COVID-19 pandemic, many stroke survivors have lost their access to rehabilitation. Therefore, telerehabilitation may help in overcoming this issue. In this study we aim to find if the use of telerehabilitation in Saudi Arabia would improve balance and walking in stroke survivors during this pandemic.\n\nMethods: 2 stroke survivors ( male and female/ \\>6 months post stroke) are included in this case study. Participants will receive a task-specific activity training (3days/week moderate exercises for 4 weeks) Both participants will provide feedback through questionnaires pre and post the 4 weeks intervention. We will use the Activities- specific balance confidence (ABC) scale, Lower limb functional scale (LEFS) and Stroke severity quality of life scale ( SS-Qol).\n\nâ€¢ Intervention: The participants will follow a home-based exercise through videos with follow up from the therapists for 4 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke survivors participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects who have been diagnosed with stroke 6 months or more.\n\n1)Either right and left hemiparesis. 2) Subjects able to walk with or without assistive device. 3) age between 40-80. 4) Subjects can understand and follow commands.\n\nExclusion criteria is: 1) subjects with uncontrolled Blood pressure, heart rate or breathing problems. 2) Having an orthopedic problem or","interventionNames":["Other: Home-based exercise program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home-based exercise program","description":"The exercise program will include task specific training to improve balance and the training will progress every two weeks.
