Current therapies are lacking a progression of intensity based on clear criteria. In addition, therapies include rather analytical exercises and the transfer of the achieved functions to activities of daily living remains difficult. Therefore, the investigators developed a criterion based system, in which the investigators are matching interventions to specific neglect related deficits and behaviour. The investigators plan a randomised controlled trial (stage 2 \"development of concept trial\") to evaluate whether an Experimental Group with 20 Sessions of 30 minutes with a visual and tactile scanning training in the personal, peripersonal and extrapersonal space combined with trunk rotation or a Control Group with 20 Sessions of 30 minutes of a standard visual scanning programme results in larger improvements on the neglect behaviour during activities of daily life (Catherine Bergego Scale). Sixteen stroke patients with left side neglect (i.e. right brain lesions) will be recruited in an inpatient rehabilitations setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemispatial Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Visual and tactile scanning training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20 Sessions of 30 minutes with a visual and tactile scanning training in the personal, peripersonal and extrapersonal space combined with trunk rotation","interventionNames":["Other: Visual and tactile scanning training"]},{"label":"Unimodal visual scanning training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"20 sessions of 30 minutes with traditional uni-modal visual scanning training","interventionNames":["Other: Uni-modal visual scanning training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Visual and tactile scanning training","description":"20 Sessions of 30 minutes with a visual and tactile scanning training in the personal, peripersonal and extrapersonal space and trunk rotation.
