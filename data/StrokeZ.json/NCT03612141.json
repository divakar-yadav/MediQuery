The first source of organ donor in France is patients with brain death. 58% of patients in brain death are patients with a severe stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhagic). In order to identify which patient with a severe stroke and with unfavorable prognosis who can evolve to brain death, we have conducted a retrospective study in Lorrain, in France, and we have built a predictive score of brain death in these patients. It is important to validate this predictive score in a prospective study on a greater scale than the first study.","detailedDescription":"Main objective :\n\nExternal validation of a brain death evolution predictive score GRAHAL65 (initial Glasgow score ≤6, systolic blood pressure \\>150 mmHg, past history of alcohol abuse, herniation, hydrocephalus, and stroke volume\\>65 ml) for patients with severe stroke and withhold therapy built.\n\nSecondary objectives :\n\nIdentification of other clinical and paraclinical predictive factors of brain death evolution:\n\n* Age,sex,\n* Temperature and glycemia\n* Rostro-caudal abolition of brainstem reflexes\n* Other cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia,)\n* Antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant treatment,\n* Intravenous thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy\n* Type of stroke\n* Infarct location\n* Type of brain herniation"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Severe
