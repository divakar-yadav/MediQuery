Recent developments in neuroimaging have focus on the reasons why some patients recover well while some do poorly. However, there is still no consensus on the exact mechanisms involved in regaining the functions after rehabilitation. Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to facilitate neural plasticity during stroke treatment has recently gained considerable attention. The possible mechanism through which rTMS acts is based on the interhemispheric competition (IHC) model, which explains that patients with stroke experience alterations in cortical excitability and exhibit abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemisphere. The visual feedback training can improve postural control and enhance motor performance. Several rTMS studies have evaluated the lower extremity dysfunction following stroke, but few studies have explored the efficacy of applying rTMS on the lower extremities. We expect the study can help us to further exploration of the change of clinical function and cortical excitability following rTMS and visual feedback training in subjects with stroke. In addition, the results of this project will be provided for further rehabilitation programs in people with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Objective: To investigate the effects of combining rTMS with visual feedback training to improve movements in the paretic lower limb and gait performance.\n\nMethods: Thirty patients with monohemispheric after ischemic stroke will recruited and randomized into 3 groups. The group 1 received a 10-minute rTMS intervention then a 30-minute visual feedback training. The group 2 received a 10-minute sham rTMS intervention then a 30-minute visual feedback training. The group 3 received a 10-minute sham rTMS intervention then a 30-minute traditional rehabilitation training. All subjects received treatments 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The performance was assessed by a blinded assessor for two times (baseline and after 4 weeks). The outcome measures included Motor evoked potential (MEP), Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower Limb section(FMA-LE),Motor Assessment Score(MAS), Berg Balance Test (BBS),Time Up and Go (TUG), and Modified Barthel Index for ADL ability. Collected data will be analyzed with ANOVA test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05. The hypothesis is combining rTMS with visual feedback training has positive effects on lower limb and gait performance among patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["rTMS","visual feedback","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single Blind (Outcomes Assessor)","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rTMS+visual feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10-minute rTMS and then a 30-minute visual feedback training ,3 times a week, for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: rTMS","Behavioral: visual feedback training"]},{"label":"sham rTMS+visual feedback","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"10-minute sham rTMS and then a 30-minute visual feedback training ,3 times a week, for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: rTMS","Behavioral: visual feedback training"]},{"label":"sham rTMS+traditional training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"10-minute sham rTMS and then a 30-minute traditional rehabilitation training,3 times a week, for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: rTMS","Behavioral: traditional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"rTMS","description":"The EMG measured the MEPs of the anterior tibialis in response to the TMS delivered using a Magstim Rapid2 stimulator (Magstim Co, Ltd, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK) with a 70-mm figure-8 coil (maximum power, 2.2 T) over the contralateral M1.
