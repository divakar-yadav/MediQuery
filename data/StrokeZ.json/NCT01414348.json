Our pilot work shows that community dwelling survivors of ABI can significantly improve performance on self-identified real- world performance problems and that they can transfer this learning to improve goals not trained in the treatment sessions. We will compare two types of rehabilitation intervention using a randomized controlled trial. We will also interview survivors, their significant others and clinicians regarding their experiences with each intervention to help us discover what works best.","detailedDescription":"Executive dysfunction is endemic after severe acquired brain injuries (ABIs) and is highly associated with long-lasting psychosocial distress, problems in a multiplicity of everyday activities and overall reduced quality of life. There is increasing evidence to suggest that a novel behavioral intervention is a treatment of choice for executive dysfunction. However few studies have addressed ecological relevance: failing to take into account the significant impact of the complex settings of real life on executive function. More data are desperately needed in this area given the devastating consequences of ABI. We propose to investigate the benefits of two community- based interventions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)","Acquired Brain Injury"],"keywords":["participation","activities of daily living","brain injuries","executive function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":95,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In-home work on problems in daily living.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional rehabilitation."]},{"label":"Novel rehabilitation approach","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Novel rehabilitation approach"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Conventional rehabilitation.","description":"1 hour / 2x / week for up to 15 sessions","armGroupLabels":["Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Novel rehabilitation approach","description":"1 hr, 2x/week for up to 15 sessions","armGroupLabels":["Novel rehabilitation approach"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in performance on COPM","description":"Canadian Occupational Performance Measure: standardized interview","timeFrame":"pre, post, 3 month follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"DEX, IADL profile","description":"Perceived and observed impact of dysexecutive syndrome in everyday life","timeFrame":"pre, post, 3 month follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* fluent in written and spoken English,\n* have sustained (1) a moderate to severe TBI as defined by a 6-hour GCS of 12 or less OR (2) complicated mild TBI with GCS 13-15 and associated abnormal findings on CT or MRI scan OR (3) other form of acquired brain injury (ABI) that is not related to a congenital, developmental or degenerative disorder but which occurred through a medical problem or disease process including stroke,\n\nExclusion Criteria: other significant neurological or psychiatric history such as multiple sclerosis or psychiatric illness requiring hospitalization, concurrent moderate to severe depression.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Deirdre D Dawson, PhD","affiliation":"Baycrest centre","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M6A2E1","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"24053695","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Dawson DR, Anderson ND, Binns MA, Bottari C, Damianakis T, Hunt A, Polatajko HJ, Zwarenstein M.
