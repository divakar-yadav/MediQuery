Compared with other brain infarctions, the medulla oblongata involves multiple swallowing-related nerve nuclei, and the possibility of brain remodeling after injury is small. Dysphagia has become a prominent clinical problem in patients with medullary infarction, which can lead to malnutrition, decrease the quality of life of patients and affect the prognosis of the disease. Solving this clinical problem is particularly important for patients with medullary infarction. The incidence of UES opening disorder in patients with medullary infarction is as high as 80%, and the clinical problem of UES opening disorder is enthusiastically studied at home and abroad. At present, the intervention measures include balloon dilatation, surgical incision and botulinum toxin injection. Balloon dilatation is easy to cause mucosal edema and damage, and cricopharyngeal myotomy often has complications such as local infection, massive hemorrhage and local nerve injury. There is no significant difference between the success rate of UES botulinum toxin injection and surgical incision. Among the above measures, UES botulinum toxin injection has a good clinical application prospect, but the drug dosage and injection method are still not unified in clinic. In particular, how to accurately locate has become a hot topic in current research. On this basis, this study uses ultrasound combined with balloon localization to inject UES botulinum toxin and make clinical observation.","detailedDescription":"Under the ultrasound combined with balloon fixation, two injection sites were selected from the left upper esophageal sphincter, and 30U was injected respectively, and one injection site was selected from the right side, and 30U was injected. In addition, the patient also received routine swallowing training once a day for 30 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Stem Infarctions","Dysphagia, Oropharyngeal","Dysphagia, Esophageal"],"keywords":["Botulinum Toxins","Esophageal Sphincter, Upper"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Botulinum toxin type A for injection (Hengli National Drug approval number S10970037) 100U, diluted with 1 ml.9% sodium chloride solution for reserve use.Each patient was injected with 90U","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin type A for injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum toxin type A for injection","description":"Botulinum toxin was injected into the upper esophageal sphincter of each patient","armGroupLabels":["experimental group"],"otherNames":["Botulinum toxin type A for injection (Hengli National Drug approval number S10970037)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Oral Intake Scale","description":"According to whether the patient can eat by mouth and the degree of dependence on nasal feeding tube, it is divided into 7 grades, corresponding to 1-7 points respectively.
