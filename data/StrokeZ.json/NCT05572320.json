Nevertheless, almost 10% of patients undergoing TEA develop a transient and/or permanent neurological injury. There is a growing body of evidence that platelet function is associated with perioperative neurological events in this setting, although the vast majority of patients undergoing carotid TEA are already on antiplatelet agents. The aim of the present study will be to assess the correlation between the platelet function evaluated by the impedance aggregometry (Multiplate Â® Analyzer, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and neurological events in patients undergoing carotid TEA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Carotid Artery Diseases"],"keywords":["Carotid thromboendarterectomy","Thromboembolic Stroke","Platelet function","Aggregometry","Vascular surgery","mortality","neurological events"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":386,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Platelet Aggregometry Testing","description":"1.6 ml of blood collected in hirudin-coated tubes before the surgery","otherNames":["Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (Multiplate) device"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Platelet function and neurological events","description":"The platelet function will be evaluated by Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (Multiplate).
