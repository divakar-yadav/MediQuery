Given the dearth of music therapy and cognitive rehabilitation research conducted in Malaysia, this pilot study intended to investigate the effect of active and passive music therapy interventions versus the standard care condition in cognition among adults with neuro-rehabilitation needs.\n\nThirty subjects participated in this study. Each participant received one session of each of the following: active music therapy intervention, passive music therapy intervention, and standard card. Mini-Cog tests were conducted before and after each session and the scores were collected for data analysis. Throughout the study, observations ensured the troubleshooting of any potential flaws for future recommendations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dementia","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Music therapy","Active","Passive","neurorehabilitation needs","Cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"participant will receive one passive music therapy session consisting of relaxation to music, one active music therapy session consisting of instrument-playing, and one control condition.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Passive Music Therapy (P)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The therapist read a standardized relaxation script in the research participant's selected preferred language while improvising on the keyboard.
