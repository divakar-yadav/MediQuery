Moreover, simultaneous use of the hand and arm are needed throughout ADL's. The effects of these two approaches (circuit class training and individual task-specific training) on upper extremity function and activities of daily living (ADL's) have not yet been clearly identified, and studies on its effects on chronic stroke patients are limited.","detailedDescription":"several research found that circuit training improved various functional parameters after stroke. And most of the circuit based tasks from the published studies were focused on the leg strength, walking speed, distance and balance etc. Previous literature found that circuit class training is effective in improving upper extremity function in chronic stroke patients disregarding the type of stroke and the results of that study are not generalized for chronic stroke patients with upper extremity deficit. Secondly, circuit class training and task-specific training are effective for improving upper limb function following a stroke but in the acute stage. In fact, there is no evidence in which comparison of these two approaches has been done in chronic stroke patients and thirdly, between these two approaches which approach is more effective towards improving upper limb function in chronic stage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Spasticity","Motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Circuit Class Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will participate in a total of 1.5hour/day for 8 weeks with a 1:3 (therapist to patient).
