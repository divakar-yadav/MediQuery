Psychological distress is common following brain injury, but the evidence base for specific psychotherapeutic methods in this population is limited, and standard treatment approaches may not be suitable. Recently there has been a growing interest in positive psychology - the study of wellbeing, positive emotions and characteristics, and personal growth. The investigators believe that positive psychotherapy interventions may be beneficial after acquired brain injury, to reduce psychological morbidity. Because such interventions have not previously been applied in this population, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial to examine the feasibility of a brief positive psychotherapy intervention in an out-patient setting. This project will produce essential information to allow us to plan future full-scale clinical trials in this area."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acquired Brain Injury","Emotional Distress"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acquired brain injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment as usual","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard NHS care for the patient group (NHS care will vary as participants will be recruited from a variety of NHS clinics)."},{"label":"Psychotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Brief psychotherapy intervention delivered over 8 weeks in addition to standard care.","interventionNames":["Other: Psychotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Psychotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Psychotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recruitment rate at 20 weeks from baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"},{"measure":"Treatment adherence at 20 weeks from baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"},{"measure":"Sample retention at 20 weeks from baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation coefficient between first and second baseline administrations of the Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) and VIA-IS questionnaires","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Change in Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) scores at 20 weeks from baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in AHI scores at 20 weeks from baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"},{"measure":"Likert ratings of participants and therapists experiences of treatment delivery","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4) scores at 20 weeks at baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"},{"measure":"Changes in Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI) scores at 20 weeks from baseline","timeFrame":"20 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 18 years or over;\n* Diagnosis of stroke or acquired brain injury (confirmed clinically and/or radiologically);\n* Between 3 and 12 months post-injury at time of recruitment;\n* Presence of emotional distress (score in moderate or above range on at least one sub-scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; DASS-21);\n* Medically stable;\n* Able to consent to research.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Significant communication impairments that would preclude participation;\n* Diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (due to the known additional complexities contributing to outcome in this population);\n* Comorbid developmental learning disability or degenerative neurological condition.\n\nPre-injury history of mood disorder will not lead to exclusion.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jonathan Evans, PhD","affiliation":"University of Glasgow","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde","city":"Glasgow","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":55.86515,"lon":-4.25763}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001930","term":"Brain Injuries"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000006259","term":"Craniocerebral Trauma"},{"id":"D000020196","term":"Trauma, Nervous System"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4897","name":"Brain Injuries","asFound":"Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","asFound":"Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9039","name":"Craniocerebral Trauma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21713","name":"Trauma, Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"}]}},"hasResults":false}
