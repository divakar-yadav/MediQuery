Meanwhile rtPA has wery short lifetime in blood (T1/2 4-6 minutes). Some retrospective studies have found that early administration of antithrombotics (8-16 hours) after systemic thrombolysis can improve functional outcome and does not increase the risk of haemorrhage.\n\nThe investigators suggest a controlled prospective trial to recognise risks and benefits of early administration of aspirin (in 12 hours) after rtPA therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Ischemia"],"keywords":["thrombolytic therapy","tissue plasminogen activator","aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"12 hours","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-contrast CT and CT-angiography are performed in 11 hours after thrombolysis.
