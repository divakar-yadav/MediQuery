The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* to evaluate the residual neuroplastic processes in DOC state related to music exposure\n* to determine the putative modulation of the aforementioned processes and the clinical outcome of DOC patients by non-pharmacological strategies, i.e., electric (tDCS) and music stimulation\n* to evaluate the impact of this intervention on caregiver's burden and psychological distress.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of three different music-listening intervention groups. Primary outcomes will be clinical, that is based on the neurologist's observations of clinical improvement, and neurophysiological, collected pre-intervention, post-intervention and post-placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disorder of Consciousness","Stroke"],"keywords":["music stimulation","tDCS","Aphasia","Neglect","DOC","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Three groups of neurological patients will be considered for the study.
