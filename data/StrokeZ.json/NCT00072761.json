Currently there exists no systemic strategy to identify or treat children with silent strokes.\n\nThe primary aim of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of blood transfusion therapy for the prevention of silent strokes in children with sickle cell anemia. This trial will also determine if blood transfusion therapy will prevent further cerebral injury and if the measured benefits of the therapy outweigh the risks associated with it.\n\nParticipants in this multi-center trial will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups-the blood transfusion group or the observation group. Those in the blood transfusion group will receive at least monthly blood transfusion therapy. All participants will have history and physical examinations every 3 months, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the beginning of their entry into the study and at study exit.\n\nAdvances in the understanding and treatment of silent strokes will likely lead to a decrease in the burden associated with cerebral injury in children with sickle cell anemia and change the standard care for these children.\n\nStatistical Analyses: The original statistical analysis plan suggested a simple difference in proportions between the proportion of individuals with an endpoint in the transfusion group and the proportion of individuals with an endpoint in the usual care group using a traditional chi squared test. The data should be analyzed according to an intent to treat principal. Because of various logistical concerns in SIT, some individuals were not imaged within the 36-month window (30-42 months). We propose using all available information by changing the primary analysis from a dichotomous (yes/no) endpoint to a traditional epidemiological endpoint of an incidence rate in the group randomized to transfusion to the incidence rate in the group randomized to usual care. We will compute the incidence ratio:\n\n(a/ta)/(b/tb)\n\nWhere \"a\" is the number of endpoints in the transfusion group, \"ta\" is the sum of the individual times at risk of the individuals randomized to the transfusion group, \"b\" is the number of endpoints in the observation group and \"tb\" is the sum of the individual times at risk of the individuals randomized to the observation group.\n\nSince the standard statistical test for it being different than 1.0 involves the assumption of a Poisson distribution, we will compute an \"exact\" 95% confidence interval using a bootstrap with a large number of replications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell Anemia","Stroke"],"keywords":["silent cerebral infarct","silent stroke","sickle cell anemia","stroke","transfusion therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":196,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transfusion Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants allocated to the transfusion arm will receive blood transfusion therapy every 4-6 weeks for 36 months.","interventionNames":["Procedure: transfusion therapy"]},{"label":"Observation Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants allocated to the observation arm will be treated according to standard care and will receive a quarterly physical examination by a study hematologist for 36 months."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"transfusion therapy","description":"Those in the blood transfusion group will receive at least monthly blood transfusion therapy.","armGroupLabels":["Transfusion Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence of an Infarct, Defined as a Stroke or a New or Enlarged Silent Cerebral Infarct","description":"The primary end point was the recurrence of infarct or hemorrhage as determined by neuroimaging, clinical evidence of permanent neurologic injury, or both.
