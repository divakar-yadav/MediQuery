SCED are experimental designs aiming at testing the effect of an intervention using a small number of patients using repeated measurements, sequential and randomized introduction of an intervention and method-specific data analysis, including visual analysis and specific statistics.\n\nDuring baseline, patients will have a rehabilitation program in day hospital (4 days per week) with physiotherapy and physical activity and if necessary occupational and speech therapy. Isokinetic strength training will be added to this conventionnal rehabilitation program and will begin after 3, 4 or 5 weeks of baseline according to randomization\n\n12 patients will be included in this study (6 patients in subacute stage and 6 in chronic stage )."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis/Hemiplegia (One Sided Weakness/Paralysis)","Gait Disorder"],"keywords":["Stroke","Extensor thrust","resistance training","Isokinetic","walking speed","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Single Case Experimental Design (SCED)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Due to the nature of the intervention neither subjects nor staff can be blinded to allocation.
