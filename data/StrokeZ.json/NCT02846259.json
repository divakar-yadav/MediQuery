Finally the investigators will get the clinical benefits and risks of using aspirin and build the prediction model of rupture and hemorrhage for aneurysm, find out who is suitable for oral aspirin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Aneurysm","Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["intracranial aneurysm","cerebral ischemia","aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2135,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Aneurysm rupture hemorrhage","description":"Aneurysm subarachnoid hemorrhage without trauma","timeFrame":"2 years during the follow-up period"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TIA","timeFrame":"2 years during the follow-up period"},{"measure":"Aneurysm changing","description":"the aneurysm becomes bigger, its form changes, becomes two or more","timeFrame":"2 years during the follow-up period"},{"measure":"dead","timeFrame":"2 years during the follow-up period"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. has the diagnosis of unruptured intracranial aneurysm (using the CTA/DSA,smaller than 7mm)\n2. has the history of TIA or any other diseases of cerebral ischemia\n3. older than 18 years old\n4. sign the informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. has the history of intracranial aneurysm rupture hemorrhage or has more than one aneurysm untreated\n2. has a family history of intracranial aneurysm\n3. has AVMï¼ŒMMD, intracranial tumor, hydrocephalus or intracranial hemorrhage\n4. refuse to sign the informed consent\n5. allergic to contrast medium","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The investigators chose the patiens from the Tiantan hospital and other hospitals that participated in this study.The patients will all have unruptured intracranial aneurysm with the history of cerebral ischemia.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yong Cao, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"010-67096523","phoneExt":"100050","email":"caoyong6@hotmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yong Cao","affiliation":"Beijing Tiantan Hospital","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100050","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Yong Cao, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"010-67096523","phoneExt":"100050","email":"caoyong6@hotmail.com"},{"name":"Yong Cao, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33953800","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wang J, Weng J, Li H, Jiao Y, Fu W, Huo R, Yan Z, Xu H, Zhan J, Wang S, Du X, Cao Y, Zhao J.
