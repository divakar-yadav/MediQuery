Study 2. Methods-Twenty -four participants with mild to moderate stroke were randomized into telerehabilitation (Tele) group and conventional (Conv) group. They received balance training with three sessions per week for 4 weeks. The pressure distribution of buttock-pressure interface was measured by Pressure Distribution Plate (PDM-S).\n\nStudy 3.Methods: Twenty-four participants were recruited from three long-term care facilities. Participants were assigned into tele-rehabilitation (Tele group) and conventional Groups (Con group) randomly. Baseline and post-treatment physical function, daily activities and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed by Simplified-STREAM, Berge Balance scale (BBS), Barthel index (BI), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS 3.0), respectively. Interventions were conducted to both groups by two different physical therapists with three sessions a week for four weeks of intervention.\n\nStudy 4. Ten participants with stroke were randomized into Tele or control group 1 (CG1) for randomized controlled trial. The Tele group also received home PT at 3 weeks later as control group 2 (CG2) for cross over design.\n\nIntervention: All three groups received 4 weeks training (2 sessions/week, 50 minutes/session), including upper extremity and balance exercises.\n\nMain outcome measures: The assessments were performed at baseline (pre), after 4 weeks (post) and after 7 weeks (follow-up). The measures for physical function included Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment (STREAM), Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS), and Barthel index (BI). The measures for satisfaction included Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and user-satisfaction questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["telerehabilitation","stroke","Berg balance scale","stroke impact scale","mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"telerehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"telerehabilitation via internet","interventionNames":["Other: telerehabilitation"]},{"label":"conventional","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"conventional therapy"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"telerehabilitation","description":"telerehabilitation for 4 weeks, 2 sessions per week and 30 to 50 minutes per session","armGroupLabels":["telerehabilitation"],"otherNames":["physical therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes of Berg Balance Scale","description":"To measure static and dynamic balance during daily activities","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes of Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)","description":"the quality of life questionnaire","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having a first episode of unilateral stroke with hemiparesis,\n* Brunnstrom score between stages II and VI for the upper and lower hemiplegic extremities,\n* Being able to understand and follow simple verbal instructions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Those with other major diseases (e.g., Parkinson disease and severe osteoarthritis) and unstable medical conditions during the study period.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Kwan-Hwa Lin, PhD","affiliation":"School and Graduate Institute of Physical Therapy, National Taiwan University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"School and Graduate Institute of Physical Therapy, National Taiwan University","city":"Taipei","zip":"100","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
