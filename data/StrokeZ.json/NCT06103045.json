We hypothesize there are different effects between unilateral and bilateral mirror therapy on stroke patients at acute stage. Method: Patients with unilateral stroke and the onset within one month will be recruited and then randomly allocated to one of the three groups (including unilateral mirror therapy, bilateral mirror therapy, and conventional occupational therapy). Patient will receive 20 consecutive sessions of intervention (5 time per week, totally 4 weeks) and assessments before and after the intervention within one week. In each intervention session, patients will receive 30 minutes unilateral or bilateral mirror therapy depending on their allocated groups and then 30 conventional occupational therapy. The patients recruited in the conventional occupational therapy group will receive 60 minute conventional therapy. The outcome measures at pre- and post-treatment will including the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE), the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI), the Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (rNSA), and Functional Independence Measurement (FIM)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","unilateral mirror therapy","bilateral mirror therapy","acute stage","motor function of upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients with unilateral stroke and the onset within one month will be recruited and then randomly allocated to one of the three groups (including unilateral mirror therapy, bilateral mirror therapy, and conventional occupational therapy).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The outcomes assessors in charrge of pre- and post-test assessments were blinded to randomized allocation and intervention.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"unilateral mirror therapy (UMT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 30 minutes unilateral mirror therapy and then 30 minutes conventional occupational therapy in each treatment session. there will be 20 consecutive sessions (5 times per week, lasting 4 weeks totally)","interventionNames":["Other: unilateral and bilateral mirror therapy"]},{"label":"Bilateral Mirror Therapy (BMT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 30 minutes bilateral mirror therapy and then 30 minutes conventional occupational therapy in each treatment session. there will be 20 consecutive sessions (5 times per week, lasting 4 weeks totally)","interventionNames":["Other: unilateral and bilateral mirror therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional Occupational Therapy (COT)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive 60 minutes conventional occupational therapy in each treatment session. there will be 20 consecutive sessions (5 times per week, lasting 4 weeks totally)","interventionNames":["Other: unilateral and bilateral mirror therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"unilateral and bilateral mirror therapy","description":"The mirror box is placed on a table in the sagittal plane of the participant.
