The patients in the TRIDENT main study who are identified to be eligible for the MRI Sub-Study will undergo MRI scans at baseline (6 weeks to 6 months post-randomisation) and at 36-month follow-up time points. All data collected will be analysed centrally at the Brain and Mind Centre (BMC) in Sydney, Australia.","detailedDescription":"Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious type of stroke, accounting for 10% of stroke in high-income countries and up to 50% in low-to-middle income countries, especially in Asia where hypertension is common. ICH in the context of hypertension is often a manifestation of underlying cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).\n\nIn summary, there is a considerable body of evidence supporting and association of CSVD with hypertension and poor outcomes, but limited evidence as to whether good BP control can modify the natural history of this condition."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Vascular Dementia","Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Main Study: Multicentre, international, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Triple Pill (Active Treatment)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"telmisartan 20mg, amlodipine 2.5mg, and indapamide 1.25mg;","interventionNames":["Drug: telmisartan 20 mg + amlodipine 2.5mg + indapamide 1.25mg"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"received via blinded study oral capsules","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo oral capsule"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"telmisartan 20 mg + amlodipine 2.5mg + indapamide 1.25mg","description":"low-dose combination therapy","armGroupLabels":["Triple Pill (Active Treatment)"],"otherNames":["Triple Pill"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo oral capsule","description":"matched placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in T2 FLAIR white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume","timeFrame":"36 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Whole brain atrophy measured by percentage brain volume change between baseline and 36 months on HIRES-T1.","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Substructure change - cortical grey matter","description":"expected range: \\>400,000 and \\<800,000mm3 Relevant Sequence: 3D-T1","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Substructure change - white matter","description":"expected range: \\>400,000 and \\<900,000mm3 Relevant Sequence: 3D-T1","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Substructure change - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)","description":"volume change measured Relevant Sequence: 3D-T1","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"Change in number of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs)","timeFrame":"36 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
