Mirror therapy, in its computerized version (IVS3, Dessintey, Saint-Etienne, France), is based on the substitution of the deficient visual feedback by a visual feedback of a correctly realized movement. The proprioceptive illusion is based on the external application of a vibrator on muscle tendons at a frequency between 50 and 120 Hz. These two techniques are currently used independently. They are, in theory, complementary and additive. No study has described the combinatorial properties of the illusions generated by these 2 techniques in hemiplegic subjects and healthy subjects.","detailedDescription":"The study hypothesis is that the administration of mirror therapy together with vibration will increase the perception of movement in a subjective scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT)","Intensive Visual Simulation3 (IVS3)","Vibration","Vibrasens","Upper limb rehabilitation","Stroke","Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient with first stroke causing hemiplegic","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient with first stroke causing hemiplegic will be included.\n\nThey will have Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) associated at tendon vibration:\n\n* Visit 1: wrist flexion (right and left arms) with 5 randomized experimental conditions (vision+vibration, vision alone, vibration alone, static image+vibration, vision of extension+vibration(incongruence))\n* Visit 2 (1 week later): wrist extension (right and left arms) with 5 randomized experimental conditions (vision+vibration, vision alone, vibration alone, static image+vibration, vision of flexion+vibration (incongruence)) These conditions will be recording by the Kinovea software, which allows the measurement of angles and amplitudes.","interventionNames":["Device: Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT)","Device: Tendon vibration"]},{"label":"healthy subjects","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Healthy subjects will be included.\n\nThey will have Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) associated at tendon vibration:\n\n* Visit 1: wrist flexion (right and left arms) with 5 randomized experimental conditions (vision+vibration, vision alone, vibration alone, static image+vibration, vision of extension+vibration(incongruence))\n* Visit 2 (1 week later): wrist extension (right and left arms) with 5 randomized experimental conditions (vision+vibration, vision alone, vibration alone, static image+vibration, vision of flexion+vibration (incongruence)) These conditions will be recording by the Kinovea software, which allows the measurement of angles and amplitudes.","interventionNames":["Device: Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT)","Device: Tendon vibration"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT)","description":"Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) will be realizing by the device Intensive Visual Simulation 3 (IVS3).\n\nThe patient looks on a screen in front of him, mirroring the movements made by his hand, while attempting to perform the same movement with his other hand.","armGroupLabels":["Patient with first stroke causing hemiplegic","healthy subjects"],"otherNames":["Intensive Visual Simulation3 (IVS3), Dessintey, Saint Etienne, France"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Tendon vibration","description":"Transcutaneous vibrations are used.
