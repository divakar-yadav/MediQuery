Among numerous efforts to combat this issue, is off-pump CABG (OPCABG) that obviates the need for extracorporeal circulation and is associated with improved outcomes. The objective of this study is to examine whether the neuroprotective effect of OPCABG can be further pronounced by the use of two state-of-the-art operating techniques.\n\nIn this randomised, controlled, investigator and patient blinded single center superiority trial with three parallel arms a total of 360 patients will be recruited. They will be allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to two treatment and one control arms. Treatment arms undergoing either aortic no-touch OPCABG or OPCABG with a partial clamp applying carbon dioxide surgical field flooding will be compared against control arm undergoing OPCABG. The primary endpoint will be the appearance of new lesions on control brain magnetic resonance imaging 3 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints will include the prevalence of new focal neurological deficits in the first 7 days after surgery, the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at either 1 week or 3 months after surgery and the incidence of delirium in the first 7 days after surgery. Data will be analysed on intention-to-treat principles and a per protocol basis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurological Injury","Stroke","Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction","Postoperative Delirium","Coronary Artery Disease","Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery","Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass"],"keywords":["Brain Injuries","Neurological Injury","Stroke","Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction","Postoperative Delirium","Coronary Artery Disease","Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting","Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery","Bypass surgery","Beating Heart Coronary Artery Bypass","Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The CANON trial is designed as a randomised, controlled, investigator and patient blinded single center superiority trial with three parallel arms and a primary endpoint being the appearance of new lesions on control brain magnetic resonance imaging 3 days after surgery.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":192,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"aortic no-touch OPCABG","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"aortic no-touch OPCABG","interventionNames":["Procedure: aortic no-touch OPCABG"]},{"label":"OPCABG with partial clamp applying carbon dioxide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"OPCABG with partial clamp applying carbon dioxide","interventionNames":["Procedure: OPCABG with partial clamp applying carbon dioxide"]},{"label":"OPCABG with partial clamp","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"OPCABG with partial clamp","interventionNames":["Procedure: OPCABG with partial clamp"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"aortic no-touch OPCABG","description":"(Study arm 1) In this intervention only the internal mammary artery grafts will be used (i.e. left internal mammary artery graft, right internal mammary artery graft, or a Y-graft that uses right internal mammary artery graft anastomosed onto left internal mammary artery graft to allow for a wide territory of myocardial revascularization).
