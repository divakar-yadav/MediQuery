Traditionally, intervention selection and application of neuroplasticity to stroke patients depends on personal preference and experience of therapists. Recent development of technologies may provide more accessible, efficient, objective, intensive and predictive methods compared to traditional practices in facilitating the process of recovery after brain injury and standardizing stroke rehabilitation programs.\n\nA clinical quality improvement program named Accelerated Stroke Ambulation Program (ASAP) was started in Stroke Rehabilitation Program Tai Po Hospital by Physiotherapy Department since 2019, pilot period from October 2019 to September 2020 and execute as standard practice afterward.","detailedDescription":"The goal of ASAP was to facilitate maximal walking ability of stroke patients by standardized application of modern technologies. ASAP features standardized functional assessment, standardized intensive early ambulation with modern technologies such as Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthoses, Lower Limb Robotic-Assisted Gait Training and Video-Guide Training. In order to monitor the progress of each patient proactively, Stroke Registry and Reference Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (MRMI) Gain were developed. Stroke Registry was a longitudinal stroke rehabilitation database to monitor patients' functional outcome and therapists' intervention compliance. Reference MRMI Gain was a clinical prediction model based on big data concept to support goal-orientated approach of physiotherapists in stroke rehabilitation. Stroke treatment library, a standardized exercise prescription in video format was also developed to facilitate standardized prescription of interventions to patients with different level of ability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","physiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":650,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pre-ASAP","description":"Conventional Stroke Rehabilitation Program"},{"label":"Post-ASAP","description":"Standardized functional assessment, standardized intensive early ambulation with modern technologies such as Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthoses and Robotic-Assisted Gait Training.
