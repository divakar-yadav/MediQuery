organisational models developed in the framework of the BeyondSilos pilot service in order to provide ICT supported integrated health and social care to elderly patients","detailedDescription":"The overall aim of the evaluation carried out in BeyondSilos is to identify the differences introduced by implementing ICT supported integrated care in different domains according to the MAST evaluation framework, including safety, clinical and social outcomes, resource use and cost of care, user/carer experience and organisational changes.\n\nThe focus of the evaluation will be the impact of so called \"horizontal\" integration, which is the integration between social care and health care, and the changing organisational models for elderly patients.\n\nThe hypothesis in this study is that integrated care (IC) will lead to a more personalised and coordinated care, improve outcomes for elderly patients, deliver more effective care and support, and provide more cost efficient health and social services."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure","Stroke","COPD","Diabetes"],"keywords":["information technology","telemedicine","integrated care","MAST framework","organizational
