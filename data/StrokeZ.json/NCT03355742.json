A minimum of 800 to a maximum of 960 subjects will be registered from approximately 50 sites globally and subject registration is capped at 120 per site. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be assessed at 1-month follow-up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (MI), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within 1 month (prior to 1-month visit but at least 28 days) after stenting and have been compliant with 1-month DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for \\> 7 consecutive days are considered as \"1-month clear\", and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor inhibitor as early as 28 days and continue with aspirin monotherapy through 12-month follow-up.\n\nAll registered subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure. The data collected from the XIENCE 28 Global Study will be compared with the historical control of non-complex HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT up to 12 months from the XIENCE V USA Study

Up to three target lesions with a maximum of two target lesions per epicardial vessel.\n\n   Note:\n   1. The definition of epicardial vessels means left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA) and their branches. For example, the subject must not have \\>2 lesions requiring treatment within both the LAD and a diagonal branch in total.\n   2. If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is considered as a single target lesion.\n2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated reference vessel diameter between 2.25 mm and 4.25 mm.\n3. Exclusive use of XIENCE family of stent systems during the index procedure.\n4. Target lesion has been treated successfully, which is defined as achievement of a final in-stent residual diameter stenosis of \\<20% with final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI-3) flow assessed by online quantitative angiography or visual estimation, with no residual dissection National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grade ≥ type B, and no transient or sustained angiographic complications (e.g., distal embolization, side branch closure), no chest pain lasting \\> 5 minutes, and no ST segment elevation \\> 0.5mm or depression lasting \\> 5 minutes.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject with an indication for the index procedure of acute ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI).\n2. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor), everolimus, cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.\n3. Subject with implantation of another drug-eluting stent (other than XIENCE) within 12 months prior to index procedure.\n4. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<30%.\n5. Subject judged by physician as inappropriate for discontinuation from P2Y12 inhibitor use at 1 month, due to another condition requiring chronic P2Y12 inhibitor use.\n6. Subject with planned surgery or procedure necessitating discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor within 1 month following index procedure.\n7. Subject with a current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.\n8. Subject intends to participate in an investigational drug or device trial within 12 months following the index procedure.\n9. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test.\n\n   Note: Female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to use safe contraception (e.g., intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives: contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches hormonal vaginal devices, injections with prolonged release). It is accepted, in certain cases, to include subjects having a sterilised regular partner or subjects using a double barrier contraceptive method. However, this should be explicitly justified in special circumstances arising from the trial design, product characteristics and/or trial population.\n10. Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical investigation results.\n11. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed its primary endpoint.\n\nAngiographic Exclusion Criteria\n\n1. Target lesion is in a left main location.\n2. Target lesion is located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft.\n3. Target lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation.\n4. Target lesion is a chronic total occlusion (CTO, defined as lesion with TIMI flow 0 for at least 3 months).\n5. Target lesion is implanted with overlapping stents, whether planned or for bailout.\n\nNote: If there is more than one target lesion, all target lesions must satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria. Non-target lesion (i.e., lesions that do not meet the angiographic criteria listed above) treatments are not allowed during the index procedure.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Marco Valgimigli, MD","affiliation":"Bern University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH","city":"Linz","state":"Upr Aus","zip":"4021","country":"Austria","geoPoint":{"lat":48.30639,"lon":14.28611}},{"facility":"Onze-Lieve-Vrouwziekenhuis Campus Aalst","city":"Aalst","state":"Eflndrs","zip":"9300","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.93604,"lon":4.0355}},{"facility":"UZ Gent","city":"Gent","state":"Flemish","zip":"42100","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05,"lon":3.71667}},{"facility":"Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg","city":"Genk","state":"Limburg","zip":"3600","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.965,"lon":5.50082}},{"facility":"Jesse Ziekenhuis","city":"Hasselt","state":"Limburg","zip":"3500","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.93106,"lon":5.33781}},{"facility":"Beijing AnZhen Hospital","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100029","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}},{"facility":"The Second Hospital of Jilin University","city":"Changchun","state":"N China","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":43.88,"lon":125.32278}},{"facility":"Universitäts-Herzzentrum Freiburg - Bad Krozingen","city":"Bad Krozingen","state":"Bad-wur","zip":"79189","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":47.91933,"lon":7.69045}},{"facility":"Elisabeth-Krankenhaus Essen GmbH","city":"Essen","state":"N.
