Some develop a non-use: they can, but do not, use their paretic limb. Non-use is a general phenomenon applied to all situations where the patient applies unnecessary compensation. Several rehabilitation techniques are effective to counter non-use, but there is insufficient knowledge to choose the most suitable technique. Optimal control theory could help guide these choices. It assumes that the chosen coordination satisfies the constraints of the task (force, amplitude, tolerance) while reducing the cost of the movement. This study will assess non-use by anticipating the sensitivity to the constraints of force and precision deduced from the logic of optimal control. The study authors expect to observe a weakness effect: in a reaching task (i.e. when the person has to touch an object placed in front of them), lightening the paretic arm makes it possible to reduce non-use, and a precision effect: in a reaching task, non-use increases with the required spatial precision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Non-use","Compensation","Weakness","Optimal control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":53,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with stroke","interventionNames":["Other: Reaching Session"]},{"label":"Controls","interventionNames":["Other: Reaching Session"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Reaching Session","description":"Two x 45 minutes sessions of reaching tasks.
