In addition to clinical variables, morphological features such as the presence of a diffusion weighted sequence (DWI) lesion and carotid stenosis of at least 50% improve risk stratification and are considered in the literature. score ABCD3-I1. Several studies have shown that brain microhemorrhages are associated with the risk of early stroke in patients with TIA. Data on white matter hypersignals on the T2-weighted sequence or FLAIR (FLuid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) are more conflicting. The global microangiopathic load, including the gaps, the hypersignals of the white matter, the perivascular spaces visible on MRI in the basal ganglia, especially when they are very numerous (\\> 20) and the gaps, have recently been described as being associated with stroke risk within 2 to 3 years of TIA or ischemic stroke. To date, the predictive value of global microangiopathic burden on early stroke risk in the course of TIA is not known."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diagnosis of TIA","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":376,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diagnosis of AIT","description":"Patients in the neurovascular unit of the Neurological Hospital of Lyon between 01/01/2016 and 30/12/2017 with a probable diagnosis of AIT and having an MRI within 7 days of TIA.","interventionNames":["Other: microangiopathic burden"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"microangiopathic burden","description":"to determine the value of the global microangiopathic burden on the prediction of early stroke risk in a homogeneous cohort of TIA.","armGroupLabels":["Diagnosis of AIT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke recurrence within 90 days,","description":"The stroke recurrence within 90 days is determined via a clinical consultation or telephone call to the patient with a structured questionnaire.","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with probable TIA with Regression of symptoms within 24 hours (unilateral motor or sensory disorders affecting the face and / or limbs , language disorder, blindness of an eye or amputation of a visual field)\n* Patients with possible AIT with 2 of these symptoms associated: fear of heights, diplopia, dysarthria, disorders of swallowing, loss of balance, isolated sensory symptoms affecting only part of a limb or hemiface.\n* Patient who have had a brain MRI.\n* Patient over 18 year-old.\n* Patient who give their non opposition to participate at the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients in the neurovascular unit of the Neurological Hospital of Lyon between 01/01/2016 and 30/12/2017 with a probable diagnosis of TIA and having an MRI within 7 days of the TIA.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Norbert NIGHOGHOSSIAN","affiliation":"Hospices Civils de Lyon","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospices Civils de Lyon","city":"Bron","zip":"69677","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.73333,"lon":4.91667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
