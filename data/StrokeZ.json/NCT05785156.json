In stroke, the predictive value of action slowing at the acute phase for predicting post-stroke functional outcome remains poorly investigated. In neurodegenerative diseases, the diagnostic relevance of the slowing at the prodromal stage remains unknown and this diagnostic requires new tests. Finally, in terms of anatomical determinants, few studies have studied the determinants of action slowing. The objectives of this project are to Determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of action slowing assessed with new quick tests in patients with acute stroke (Neurovascular Unit) and cognitive neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer Disease (AD), Lewy Body disease (LBD), Fronto Temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Cortico Basal Degeneration (CBD) and Progressive Supra Nuclear Palsy (PSNP)) and to define the lesion determinants with VBM and VLSM"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Action Speed","Dementia Mild Cognitive Impairment","Alzheimer Disease"],"keywords":["executive processes","attention","Stroke","action speed","Diagnostic","sensitivity","specificity","dementia mild cognitive impairment","Alzheimer disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":129,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"acute stroke patients","interventionNames":["Other: quick tests"]},{"label":"cognitive neurodegenerative disorders","description":"cognitive neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer Disease (AD), Lewy Body disease (LBD), FrontoTemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Cortico Basal Degeneration (CBD) and Progressive Supra Nuclear Palsy (PSNP)","interventionNames":["Other: quick tests"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"quick tests","description":"New quick tests are\n\n* Batterie MindPlus (Brevet n° FR1908081, Suarez 2019) is a quick reaction time battery and\n* Minimal Cognitive Evaluation (MCE) test (Sardi et al, 2019) is a cognitive screening tests including a specific assessment of slowing","armGroupLabels":["acute stroke patients","cognitive neurodegenerative disorders"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Value of the speed of the action with the 'RT Componential Analysis of Action Speed' battery in all patients","description":"RT Componential Analysis of Action Speed","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Speed values of action measured in all patients with the \"MindPlus\" battery in all patients","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients between 40 and 85 years old,\n* French native language,\n* Social Security affiliation.\n* University Memory Clinic for: Mild severity disorder (MMSE\\> 19) or major severity disorder related to AD : Albert 2011 criteria ;
