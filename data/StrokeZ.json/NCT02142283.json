However, an important indicator of whether subjects will benefit or not during this later time window is the confirmation of a large vessel occlusion (LVO), and assessment of the core infarct volume relative to the volume of salvageable penumbra. Therefore, standardized imaging selection of subjects is required for inclusion into the study.\n\nThis trial has been designed with subject safety in mind, as a seamless Phase II (feasibility) / Phase III (pivotal) adaptive design, in order to address the concerns around potential unknown harms to enrolled subjects. This study will help to answer the question of whether carefully selecting subjects by using Clinical Imaging Mismatch will allow acute ischemic stroke patients who present at or beyond 6 hours from Time Last Seen Well (TLSW) to be considered for intra-arterial intervention. If Trevo thrombectomy plus medical management leads to better clinical outcomes over medical management alone, more patients in the future could receive endovascular treatment (either in addition to or in lieu of IV tPA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Mechanical thrombectomy","Acute ischemic stroke","Wake up stroke","Late presenting stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":206,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Trevo Thrombectomy Procedure","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Trevo Thrombectomy Procedure and Medical Management","interventionNames":["Device: Trevo Thrombectomy Procedure","Other: Medical Management"]},{"label":"Medical Management","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Medical Management","interventionNames":["Other: Medical Management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Trevo Thrombectomy Procedure","description":"stent retriever; intended to restore blood flow in the neurovasculature by removing thrombus (clot)","armGroupLabels":["Trevo Thrombectomy Procedure"],"otherNames":["Trevo ProVue Retriever","Trevo XP ProVue Retriever"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Medical Management","description":"Standard of Care not including mechanical thrombectomy, no intra arterial treatment, may include aspirin, therapy etc","armGroupLabels":["Medical Management","Trevo Thrombectomy Procedure"],"otherNames":["Standard of Care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Weighted Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score, Lead Co-Primary Efficacy Outcome","description":"mRS is a scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes neurological disability.\n\nFunctional Independence:\n\n0 - no symptoms at all\n\n1. - no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities\n2. - slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance\n3. - moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance\n4. - moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance\n5. - severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention\n6. - dead","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Functional Independence (mRS 0-2), Nested Co-Primary Efficacy Outcome","description":"Number of participants with functional independence\n\nmRS is a scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes neurological disability.\n\nFunctional Independence:\n\n0 - no symptoms at all\n\n1. - no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities\n2. - slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Stroke-related Mortality, Primary Safety Outcome","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Good Functional Outcome","description":"Proportion of participants with functional independence\n\nmRS is a scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes neurological disability.\n\nFunctional Independence:\n\n0 - no symptoms at all\n\n1. - no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities\n2. - slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Early Response","description":"The proportion of subjects with \"early response\" at Day 5-7/Discharge (whichever is earlier), defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) drop of ≥10 from baseline or NIHSS score 0 or 1.\n\nThe NIHSS is an assessment which objectively quantifies the impairment caused by a stroke.
