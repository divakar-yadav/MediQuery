at 100)\n* Test of Attentional Performance\n* Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (eight tests each designed to assess a particular aspect of object or space perception, while minimising the involvement of other cognitive skills)\n* Visual agnosia assesment protocole (noted on 10 points)","timeFrame":"Month 3"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed
