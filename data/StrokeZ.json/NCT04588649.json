Post-stroke dementia includes all types of dementia that happen after stroke, irrespective of their cause, and vascular dementia (VaD), degenerative dementia (especially Alzheimer's disease), or mixed dementia (dementia as a result of the coexistence of vascular lesions of the brain and neurodegenerative lesions) are the most common causes of post-stroke dementia. However, it is difficult to determine to what extent cognitive impairment may be attributable to stroke versus concomitant Alzheimer disease. With the advent of PET imaging technique, we are able to conduct a multi-modal neuroimaging study to explore the composite influence of vascular injury, amyloid plaque and Tau protein the the cognitive performance after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Dementia","Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"* GroupA (Stroke/TIA patients), n=300\n* Group (healthy elderly controls), n=30","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":181,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"THK-5351","type":"OTHER","description":"Name: \\[18F\\]THK5351，(S)-6-\\[(3-Fluoro-2-hydroxy)propoxy\\]-2-(2-Methylaminopyrid-5-yl)-quinoline Dosage form: intravenous injection Dose(s): 10mCi Dosing schedule: Visit 2 Mechanism of action (if known): high affinity radiotracer for the tau protein Pharmacological category：Radio pharmaceutical","interventionNames":["Drug: THK-5351","Drug: AV-45"]},{"label":"AV-45","type":"OTHER","description":"Name: \\[18F\\]AV-45, (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-\\[18F\\]fluoroethoxy) ethoxy) ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-N-methylbenzenamine Dosage form: intravenous injection Dose(s): 10mCi Dosing schedule: Visit 2 Mechanism of action (if known): high affinity radiotracer for the β- amyloid protein Pharmacological category：Radio pharmaceutical","interventionNames":["Drug: THK-5351","Drug: AV-45"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"THK-5351","description":"\\[18F\\]THK-5351 PET Imaging","armGroupLabels":["AV-45","THK-5351"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"AV-45","description":"\\[18F\\]AV-45 PET Imaging","armGroupLabels":["AV-45","THK-5351"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"CDR score of cognition deteriorating group and stable group","description":"The CDR is a 5-point scale (0、0.5、1、2、3) used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment \\& Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home \\& Hobbies, and Personal Care.
