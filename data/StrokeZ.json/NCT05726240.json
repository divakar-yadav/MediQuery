We hypothesize that treatment with ghrelin, started in the first six hours after stroke onset, improves early recovery and long-term functional outcome in these patients. Ghrelin is a naturally occurring hormone and mildly excitatory neurotransmitter also known as the 'hunger hormone.' Treatment with acylated ghrelin consistently improved functional and histological recovery in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"We will include 80 patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation, eligible for EVT. The study population will be drawn from adult patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with EVT at UMC Utrecht, Rijnstate, MST or Isala.\n\nTreatment in the intervention group will consist of intravenous acylated ghrelin, 600micrg dissolved in 50cc normal saline, by bolus (short term) infusion in 30 minutes, twice daily, for five days.
