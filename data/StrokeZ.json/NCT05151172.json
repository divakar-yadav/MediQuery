This type of stroke is called an ischemic stroke and carries a high risk of disability or death. Stroke must be treated very fast. Any delay of even 10 minutes can result in the difference between an independent and a disabled outcome, and in some cases between life and death. Endovascular therapy (EVT) or Thrombectomy is a procedure to remove the blood clot (thrombus) from a blood vessel to reopen it (recanalization). Patients are likely to benefit from a thrombectomy procedure when it is performed in a larger blood vessel. Currently it is not known if thrombectomy procedure will benefit the patients presenting with the stroke that has been caused by a blood clot in a medium sized blood vessel (medium vessel occlusion, MeVO). This trial will enrol patients diagnosed with acute stroke due to a clot in the medium sized vessel. The patients will be randomized within 12 hours of their symptom onset to either standard of care or standard of care plus thrombectomy procedure. The participation will last for 12 months Escape MeVO coordinating centre is located at the University of Calgary. There will be up to 75 sites. We will be recruiting a total of 530 patients.","detailedDescription":"ESCAPE-MeVO is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open- label study with blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE design). Participants will be randomized to routine best medical stroke care governed by current guidelines (control group) or to EVT plus best medical care. EVT will be performed with one of the Solitaire group of intracranial stent-retriever devices (Solitaire X, Medtronic) as the first line approach according to the manufacturers' specifications for use.\n\nPatients with clinical symptoms of acute stroke, last seen normal within the last 12 hours, and with either NIHSS ≥ 5 or NIHSS 3-5 due to disabling symptoms in the judgement of the stroke team shall undergo imaging to identify the MeVO and assess the status of the affected brain parenchyma. As is being currently practiced across different stroke centers, imaging may follow different imaging paradigms:\n\n* Option 1: NCCT + mCTA (first phase covers intracranial and extracranial vessels)\n* Option 2: NCCT + mCTA/spCTA + either mCTA tissue level perfusion maps or CTP perfusion maps\n* Option 3: DWI-MRI + MRA (of both the intracranial and extracranial vessels). Approach to the EVT procedure and technique will be at the discretion of the interventionist and team, with the exception that the first thrombectomy attempt is performed with one of the Solitaire group of intracranial stent-retriever devices (Solitaire X, Medtronic). Available, approved off-the-shelf, secondary devices may be used if reperfusion success is not achieved after use of the first device, at the discretion of the neuro-interventionalist\n\nThis study consists of one 90-day study period for each participant. Participants will be hospitalized for care after their acute stroke according to the current standard of care. Participants are required to return to clinic on Day 90 for end-of-study assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["endovascular thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"ESCAPE-MeVO is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open- label study with blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE design).
