All individuals will receive therapy of the hand and arm following the stimulation. This study will try to determine which brain stimulation condition leads to the greatest improvement in hand and arm function.","detailedDescription":"This study will look at the effects of a painless, non-invasive form of brain stimulation, called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is thought to increase the brain's ability to change. Participants will be assigned to one of four groups by chance. Three groups will receive tDCS at a level expected to increase the brain's ability to change, and will vary by the areas of the brain that are stimulated. The fourth group will receive tDCS at a level not thought to affect the brain's ability to change. All participants will receive intensive therapy of their impaired arm and hand, focusing on exercises that will improve their ability to function in daily life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["neuroplasticity","rehabilitation","transcranial direct current stimulation","motor training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive 20 minutes of active, excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation of the ipsilesional hemisphere at 1.4mA, followed by 2 hours of intensive motor therapy of the affected upper extremity.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: intensive upper extremity motor training"]},{"label":"Cathodal tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive 20 minutes of active, excitatoryinhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation of the contralesional hemisphere at 1.4mA, followed by 2 hours of intensive motor therapy of the affected upper extremity.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: intensive upper extremity motor training"]},{"label":"Dual tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive 20 minutes of active, excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation of the ipsilesional hemisphere and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation of the contralesional hemisphere at 1.4mA, followed by 2 hours of intensive motor therapy of the affected upper extremity.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: intensive upper extremity motor training"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects will receive 20 minutes of sham transcranial direct current stimulation, followed by 2 hours of intensive motor therapy of the affected upper extremity.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: intensive upper extremity motor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial direct current stimulation","description":"This is a non-invasive form of stimulation which delivers safe, low levels of electrical current to the brain through the scalp.","armGroupLabels":["Anodal tDCS","Cathodal tDCS","Dual tDCS","Sham tDCS"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"intensive upper extremity motor training","description":"This training is administered one-on-one with an occupational therapist.
