It has been shown to be effective in the secondary prevention of stroke especially in the SVD and it may be related to the other non-antiplatelet effects of cilostazol.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n* In this study, we aim to investigate whether cilostazol affects the changes of PIs in patients with acute lacunar infarction using serial TCDs.\n* Our hypothesis is that cilostazol has other non-antiplatelet effects such as vasodilation effect and may decrease the vascular resistance in patients with acute lacunar infarction. Hence, cilostazol will decrease the PIs in patients with acute lacunar infarction.","detailedDescription":"TREATMENTS:\n\n* Cilostazol is an agent inhibiting platelet aggregation.\n* A matching placebo of cilostazol is an inactive substance that looks similar to the active cilostazol tablet.\n\nTREATMENT PLAN:\n\n* There will be two treatment groups; one will receive cilostazol 200mg (100mg twice per day), the second matching placebo of cilostazol.\n* These study drugs will be administered on top of aspirin (100mg) systematically prescribed to such patients\n\nPRIMARY ENDPOINT:\n\n* The changes of PI between the baseline and 14 and 90 days follow-up study.\n\nSTUDY EXECUTION:\n\n* Two hundred sixty patients, presenting with first ever lacunar infarction within 7 days after the onset of symptoms will be recruited within two years.\n* Patients will be followed up during the three months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Cerebral infarction","Cilostazol","Aspirin","Transcranial Doppler","Pulsatile Index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":203,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Asprin (100mg) plus placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Asprin (100mg) plus placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]},{"label":"Asprin (100mg) plus cilostazol (200mg)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Asprin (100mg) plus cilostazol (200mg)","interventionNames":["Drug: cilostazol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"Asprin (100mg) plus placebo","armGroupLabels":["Asprin (100mg) plus placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"cilostazol","description":"Aspirin (100mg) plus cilostazol (200mg)","armGroupLabels":["Asprin (100mg) plus cilostazol (200mg)"],"otherNames":["Pletaal"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Changes of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) and Basilar Artery (BA) Pulsatility Index (PI) at 14 and 90 Days From the Baseline Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Study","description":"The PI is designed to measure vascular resistance and characterizes the shape of the spectral waveform.
