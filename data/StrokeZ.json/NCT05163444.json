They need walking aids like quadripod cane or rolling cane.\n\nThe quadripod cane confers a great stability but implies a walk in 3 times, thus consume more energy. The pause time necessary for the displacement (uplift) of the cane disappear with the Wheeleo.\n\nThe investigators will study many spatio-temporal parameters to determine which one allows to decrease the walking speed.","detailedDescription":"Hemiparesis affects 65% of stroke patients and cause gait disorders. During rehabilitation, patients often need technical aids to the the return to walk.\n\nFor example, they can use the quadripod cane and the rolling cane, called Wheeleo. Regarding the first one, as its name indicate, there are 4 feet while the other model has 4 wheels.\n\nDeltombe and al. proved that the walking speed is higher with a rolling cane. The investigators will recruited stroke patients and study many spatio-temporal parameters with a gait analysis system, when participants are walking with the two walking aids.\n\nParticipants will achieve 6 minutes walking test and a 10 meters walking test, with a wearable inertial systems on their shoes.\n\nThe investigators wish to reveal which spatio-temporal parameters most influence walking speed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegic Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Clinical trial, randomized, crossover","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rolling can","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Gait analysis with rolling cane","interventionNames":["Device: Gait analysis with rolling cane"]},{"label":"Quadripod can","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Gait analysis with quadripod cane","interventionNames":["Device: Gait analysis with quadripod cane"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Gait analysis with rolling cane","description":"6 minutes walking test 10 meters walking test Before this experimentation, we will fix wearables sensors on the shoes.","armGroupLabels":["Rolling can"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Gait analysis with quadripod cane","description":"6 minutes walking test 10 meters walking test Before this experimentation, we will fix wearables sensors on the shoes.","armGroupLabels":["Quadripod can"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 meters walking test at fast speed","description":"Calculate the walking speed","timeFrame":"2 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 minutes walking test at spontaneous speed","description":"Spatio-temporals factors analysis (symmetry, time of unipodal/bipodal stance station,...)","timeFrame":"2 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Hemiparesis following a stroke\n* Be able to walk with a quadripod cane independently\n* Be able to walk with the rolling cane independently\n* Be able to follow instructions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* cognitive impairment\n* acute orthopedic impairment\n* other pathologies affecting walking (Parkinson's disease, severe polyneuropathy,...)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Berengere Maillard","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+32 4 366 82 41","email":"bmaillard@chuliege.be"},{"name":"Jean-fran√ßois KAUX","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+32 4 366 82 41","email":"jfkaux@chuliege.be"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Berengere Maillard","affiliation":"University of Liege","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHUOA","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Esneux","state":"Liege","zip":"4130","country":"Belgium","contacts":[{"name":"Berengere Maillard, Dr","role":"CONTACT","email":"bmaillard@chuliege.be"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":50.53596,"lon":5.56775}},{"facility":"CNRF","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Tinlot","state":"Liege","zip":"4557","country":"Belgium","contacts":[{"name":"Berengere Maillard, Dr","role":"CONTACT","email":"bmaillard@chuliege.be"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":50.47493,"lon":5.37755}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020233","term":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21748","name":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic","asFound":"Hemiplegic Gait","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
