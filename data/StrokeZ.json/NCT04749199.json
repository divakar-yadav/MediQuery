Muscle weakness and other complications associated with stroke can result in decreased quality of life and significant declines in the activities of daily living. Mirror therapy has been shown to have a moderate effect, facilitating the functional recovery among individuals who have experienced a stroke. A prototype for a computerized, mirror therapy device was developed and found to be feasible. Recently, the investigators published a critical review and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis analysing the widespread reports of brain activity associated with mirror therapy. Observations using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate a group of people with stroke (n = 14) and healthy volunteers (n = 18) revealed that performing complex tasks during the mirror therapy paradigm enhanced top-down motor facilitation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere relative to the moving limb. An important next step in this series of studies is to evaluate the training effects associated with the performance of complex tasks during mirror therapy among stroke patients, using the designed computerized mirror therapy device to deliver the enhanced mirror therapy training. The results of this study will help the investigators to understand the underlying mechanisms through which mirror therapy facilitates motor rehabilitation and will add to the body of literature describing the best, evidence-based practices for mirror therapy during stroke rehabilitation. The investigators propose a pilot study (n = 30) to test the methodological procedures and obtain preliminary results for a fully powered, randomized, controlled trial (RCT), combined with economic evaluation, to compare the therapeutic and cost-effectiveness between standard mirror therapy and enhanced (complex task and blurred image) mirror therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Mirror therapy","Stroke","Hand function","Cost-effectiveness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A blinded assessor and statistician will evaluate a two-arm, parallel-group, RCT that compares enhanced mirror therapy, comprised of increased task complexity and mirror image blurriness, with standard mirror therapy training among 30 participants with chronic stroke.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Enhanced mirror therapy group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will perform complex and randomized finger opposition and reposition movements based on the training protocol, along with enhanced complexity and altered clarity of the displayed image.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Enhanced mirror therapy"]},{"label":"Standard mirror therapy group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group will perform simple and sequential finger opposition and reposition movements, along with a clear image showing the exercising hand of the participants.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Standard mirror therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Enhanced mirror therapy","description":"Participants of the enhanced mirror therapy group will perform complex, randomized, finger opposition and reposition movements, using the thumb, index, middle, ring, and little fingers, and will be shown a 35% blurred visual feedback through the computerized mirror therapy device.
