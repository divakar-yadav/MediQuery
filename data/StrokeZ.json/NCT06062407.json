Each subject underwent two models of simultaneous fNIRs-EEG testing during the sit-to-stand process, the first without any intervention and the second based on biofeedback (EMG feedback) during the sit-to-stand process. Initial screening of fall risk in post-stroke patients was performed by comparing differences in brain activation and brain network connectivity between patients and healthy subjects. Preliminary validation the effectiveness of the EMG feedback-based sitting and standing training for post-stroke patients by comparing the differences of brain activation, brain network connectivity, and electromyographic changes during the sit-to-stand process in the two models."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke subjects without fall risk","description":"The patient was diagnosed with a stroke with a berg score of not less than 40."},{"label":"Stroke subjects with fall risk","description":"The patient was diagnosed with a stroke with a berg score of less than 40."},{"label":"Healthy subjects","description":"No history of stroke with normal lower limb motor function and balance"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Preliminary screening of brain function biomarkers for fall risk in post-stroke patients","description":"Comparison of differences in brain activation \\[HbO2 (mmol/L\\*mm)\\] between post-stroke patients with fall risk and healthy subjects","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"The brain functional effectiveness of the EMG feedback-based standing training","description":"Comparison of the differences in brain activation \\[HbO2 (mmol/L\\*mmï¼‰\\] during the sit-to-stand process in the two models.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"The neuromuscular activity of the EMG feedback-based standing training","description":"Comparison of the differences in electromyographic changes \\[EMG (uv)\\] during the sit-to-stand process in the two models.","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nStroke patients 1.
