The investigators hope to understand whether the involvement of family, friends and other members of individual's social network can help achieve better blood pressure after experiencing a stroke. Participants will be stratified to two groups according to network size (\\<5 vs 5 or more) and randomized to receive individual hypertension counseling (control) or the social network intervention. The primary outcome of the study will be the absolute reduction in systolic blood pressure at 3 months follow-up. The secondary outcomes will be attainment of a post-stroke hypertension treatment goal and patient-reported physical function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Social Networks"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Social Network Counseling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The index patient and influential social network members will meet via Zoom 3 times over the course of 3 months with a clinical research nurse for teamwork counseling and blood pressure education.","interventionNames":["Other: Social Network Group Counseling"]},{"label":"Individual Counseling","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The index patient will meet via Zoom 3 times over the course of 3 months with a clinical research nurse for blood pressure education.","interventionNames":["Other: Individual Counseling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Social Network Group Counseling","description":"Researchers will identify the influential network members based on their network position, driving distance from the patient, speaking frequency, and whether they have high blood pressure.

The teamwork specific topics will include how networks can work together as a team, communication tips for engaging with one another, spreading positive messages, and establishing the roles and responsibilities of each network team member. The blood pressure control specific topics will include the basics of blood pressure, taking and adjusting medications, monitoring blood pressure, reducing salt, and being physically active.
