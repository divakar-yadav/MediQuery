The non-inferiority of rhTNK-tPA compared to rt-PA was proved by two recent randomized controlled clinical trials but the evidence is lacking regarding the real-world effectiveness and safety of rhTNK-tPA.\n\nThis is a multi-center, observational, retrospective study that enrolled acute ischemic stroke patients treated with rhTNK-tPA thrombolysis in China."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["intravenous thrombolysis","Tenecteplase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase","description":"acute ischemic stroke patients who receive intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"alteplase","description":"acute ischemic stroke patients who receive intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Thrombolysis wtih rhTNK-tPA","armGroupLabels":["Tenecteplase"],"otherNames":["rhTNK-tPA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase","description":"Thrombolysis wtih rt-PA","armGroupLabels":["alteplase"],"otherNames":["rt-PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours","description":"Clinical deterioration or neurological decline causing an increase in NIHSS score of ≥4 points due to intracranial hemorrhage confirmed by brain imaging","timeFrame":"36 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"90 days mRS 0-1","description":"modified Rankin Scale score measures degree of disability/dependence after a stroke.
