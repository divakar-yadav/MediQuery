Fifteen percent of people who say they have a stroke need, at home, a wheelchair to get from one room to another. The use of a wheelchair can cause postural disorders which can lead to pain, orthopedic deformity and pressure ulcers.\n\nThis study aims to assess the interest of using wheelchair positioning equipment (Seat back, Positioning cushion and Belt) on the decrease of postural disorders.\n\nThis decrease will be assessed after a standardized course, performed under three different conditions: with the positioning equipment (Positioning cushion and Seat back), with the positioning equipment and the belt and with the wheelchair alone.\n\nClinical tool used to assess the decrease is the Seated Postural Control Measure for Adults 2.0 (SPCMA 2.0).\n\nThis study, which will be the first prospective, interventional, multicenter, controlled and randomized study, could pave the way for guidelines of good practice, for wheelchair positioning of hemiplegic patients in France"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia and/or Hemiparesis Following
