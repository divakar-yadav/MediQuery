Both patients and their relatives are in danger of experiencing severe lack of quality. Integrated care path programs are increasingly put into use. There is insufficient research-based documentation of the effect of such care paths.\n\nThe available documentation of different integrated care paths emphasizes early mobilization and discharge, rehabilitation in familiar surroundings, more effective communication and exchange of competence between the different service providers and educational self-management for patients as main elements in order to expect effect.\n\nThere are no studies that evaluate the effect of quality of life, functional skills and personal coping if group-based educational self management is combined with physical exercise and patients with different chronically illnesses participate in the same group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Heart Failure","Stroke"],"keywords":["chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Heart failure","Stroke","quality of life","self management education","physical exercise","primary health care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"exercise and education","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Supervised physical exercise in groups, plus a self management education programme (patient education).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Self management education programme"]},{"label":"exercise only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Supervised physical exercise in groups.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: exercise only"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Self management education programme","description":"The structured patient educational self - management programme consists of 6 weekly sessions à 2 hours.
