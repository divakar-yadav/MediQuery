Real experimental groups were divided into two types; Pre-tDCS group and Simultaneous tDCS group. Two groups are again divided into three groups; Dual stimulation group, Unilateral stimulation group and Sham control group, respectively.\n\nIn Pre-tDCS group, total a sessions of the tDCS stimulation was done for each three subgroups and visual inattention training was followed after that. In Simultaneous tDCS group, tDCS and visual inattention training was done simultaneously. For each subgroups, tDCS was attached at following locations; unilateral cathodal tDCS on unaffected PPC(postparietal cortex), P3 , dual cathodal tDCS on P3 and anodal tDCS on affected PPC, P4.\n\nThe patients were initially evaluated at baseline, immediately, 60min, 120min, 24 hrs after the training session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pre-tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In Pre-tDCS group, total sessions of the transcranical direct current stimulator stimulation(tDCS) was done for each three subgroups and visual inattention training was followed after that.\n\nPatient had 2 times of tDCS for 13 minutes with 20minutes of resting interval.
