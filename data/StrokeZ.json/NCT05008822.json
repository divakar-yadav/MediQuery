Very little data is available about the use in Motor Imaginary in post stroke upper limb rehabilitation in Pakistan. Moreover, studies done previously did not specified population of stroke; This study will include MCA stroke patients only, whom upper limb weakness is more prevalent.","detailedDescription":"Motor imagery is a technique for inducing motor activity in response to a certain motor output by producing a mental image of the action without intending to conduct it. It is a cognitive technique that, rather than making a patient to pick up new procedures, promotes neural alterations in order enable the patient to re-acquire motor skills mastered before the CVA or copy the actions of others. Motor imaging training is a sort of therapy in which the patient imagines a gesture or movement in order to learn, reinforce, or improve the movement's performance. A study done in South Korea, published in 2015, revealed that Motor imagery training has a good impact on UL performance by refining functional mobility during stroke rehabilitation. The results suggest that motor imagery training is viable and helpful for improving UL function in CVA patients.\n\nMeta-analysis done in Australia in the year 2013, was supportive of Motor imaginary techniques further convincing that Mental imagery can be a possible intervention for stroke patients given that it being, safe cost-effective \\& unlimited practice opportunities. Study done in China in 2017, suggested that clinicians should consider the use of MI in addition to treatment currently used to improve upper extremity functions after stroke as no evidence of side effects or harm was noted . RCT done in year 2006 in USA indicated that for patients with chronic, moderate upper limb impairment after CVA, program of CIMT with mental practice only resulted in decrease impairment, with functional enhancement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Cardiovascular"],"keywords":["Motor imaginary technique"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Motor Imaginary Training Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After the baseline assessment, the participant will receive Motor Imaginary Program","interventionNames":["Other: Motor Imaginary Training Group"]},{"label":"Task oriented Training Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"After the baseline assessment, the participant will receive MRP and CIMT training","interventionNames":["Other: Task oriented Training Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor Imaginary Training Group","description":"After the baseline assessment, the participant will receive Motor Imaginary Program","armGroupLabels":["Motor Imaginary Training Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Task oriented Training Group","description":"After the baseline assessment, the participant will receive MRP and CIMT training","armGroupLabels":["Task oriented Training Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"wolf motor function","description":"The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is a timed and functional test that assesses upper extremity motor skills in a quantitative manner.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to 4th Weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* MCA stroke\n* Chronic stroke patients\n* Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score \\>24 points\n* Spasticity grade II and III on Modified Ashworth scale\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe cognitive disability such as depression, unilateral neglect, seizure, dementia,\n* Any MSK disorder including muscle contracture","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Misbah ghous, MS","affiliation":"Riphah International University Islamabad","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Physical therapy department of Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan","city":"Peshawar","state":"Khyber Pakhtunkha","zip":"25000","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":34.008,"lon":71.57849}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000009203","term":"Myocardial Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","asFound":"Stroke, Cardiovascular","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
