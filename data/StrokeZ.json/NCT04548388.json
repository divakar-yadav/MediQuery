The Bobath approach consisted of about individual one hour session.\n\nIn addition to the Bobath approach, the subjects in the study group received WBV for 20 minutes a day, 2 days a week. The frequency of the device was increased by 5 Hz every week, starting the treatment with 30 Hz. Whole body vibration application was performed on a platform (Power Plate Pro5®) that provides vertical vibration. Two different practice positions were chosen as standing and semi-squatting.
