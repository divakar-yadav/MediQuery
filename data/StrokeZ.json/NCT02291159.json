The DNHS ® (Dry Needling for hypertonia and Spasticity) technique is a dry needling technique to reduce spasticity and hypertonia and improve function in patients with CNS injury. The main objective of this trial is to analyze the therapeutic effect of DNHS® technique in motor function in patients between 45 and 80 in a chronic state after a stroke. Methods: Double-blinded randomized clinical trial. There will be an intervention group (DNHS® technique) and a sham control group. The intervention will be 2 sessions, one per week, in biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis nad profundus, adductor pollicis and first dorsal interossei. The Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale and Stroke Impact Scale will be used as outcome measures. The data will be expressed as mean ± (Standard Deviation). The standardized difference or effect size (ES, 90% confidence limit) in the selected variables will be calculated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity"],"keywords":["stroke","spasticity","dry needling","upper motor neuron syndrome","motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention-DNHS technique","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dry needling of Myofascial Trigger Points","interventionNames":["Device: DNHS ® (Dry Needling for Hypertonia and Spasticity)"]},{"label":"Control-Sham Dry Needling","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham Dry Needling of Myofascial Trigger Points","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Dry Needling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DNHS ® (Dry Needling for Hypertonia and Spasticity)","description":"Dry needling of Myofascial Trigger Points. 2 sessions, one per week, in biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis nad profundus, adductor pollicis and first dorsal interossei","armGroupLabels":["Intervention-DNHS technique"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham Dry Needling","description":"Sham dry needling of Myofascial Trigger Points. 2 sessions, one per week, in biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis nad profundus, adductor pollicis and first dorsal interossei","armGroupLabels":["Control-Sham Dry Needling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale (Motor Function)","timeFrame":"Two weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale (Hypertonia/Spasticity)","timeFrame":"Two weeks"},{"measure":"Impact Stroke Scale (Quality of Life)","timeFrame":"Two weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* people aged 40-85 years with hemiplegia resulting from stroke of more than 6 months evolution (chronic stroke)\n* ability to follow instructions and reply to assessment questonnaires\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* recurrent stroke episodes\n* other concomitant neurodegenerative conditions\n* fear to needles\n* participation in a parallel study\n* any absolute contraindication for deep dry needling","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Herrero Pablo, Dr.","affiliation":"San Jorge University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"San Jorge University","city":"Villanueva de Gallego","state":"Zaragoza","zip":"50830","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":41.76917,"lon":-0.8235}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009128","term":"Muscle Spasticity"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009135","term":"Muscular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000009122","term":"Muscle Hypertonia"},{"id":"D000020879","term":"Neuromuscular Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","asFound":"Spasticity","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11782","name":"Muscular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11787","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11769","name":"Muscle Hypertonia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22309","name":"Neuromuscular Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
