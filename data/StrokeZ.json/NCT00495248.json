The study is conducted as a multi centre randomized controlled trial. Participants are recruited from five hospitals and the intervention is implemented at six to seven senior centres. The control group is offered physical activity at the senior centre once a week. The intervention group is offered the same with addition of the programme inspired by Lifestyle Redesign. The study will contribute to knowledge whether the intervention will promote social participation and thriving in daily life and prevent social isolation and depressive symptoms among community dwelling elders with stroke or TIA.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a common disease among older people. In Norway 60-70 000 people live with sequela after stroke. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and social isolation are occurring among 20 to 60 percent. Little is known about intervention for people with mild neurological symptoms who simultaneously perceive social isolation, depression and reduced satisfaction in their daily life after stroke. Lifestyle redesign (LR) is developed in the USA and is a health promoting group intervention programme with focus on the participants' exchange of experiences and involvement. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect on thriving, activity and social participation of a group intervention program inspired by Lifestyle redesign for community dwelling persons with stroke. The study is conducted as a multicentre randomized controlled trial. Participants are recruited from five hospitals and the intervention is carried through at six to seven senior centres. The control group is offered a physical activity programme at the senior centre once a week. The intervention group is offered the same with the additional intervention programme also once a week. The study will contribute to knowledge whether this group intervention will promote social participation and thriving in daily life and prevent social isolation and depressive symptoms among community dwelling elders with stroke or TIA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["group intervention","stroke","senior centres","health promotion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Group intervention inspired by Lifestyle Redesign"]},{"label":"2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Group intervention inspired by Lifestyle Redesign"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Group intervention inspired by Lifestyle Redesign","description":"Group intervention inspired by Lifestyle Redesign","armGroupLabels":["1","2"],"otherNames":["Lifestyle councelling"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Group intervention inspired by Lifestyle redesign","description":"Lifestyle programme once a week for two hours over an intervention period of 9 months","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"SF-36","timeFrame":"Approximately 3 months after stroke-BASELINE, after 6 and 9 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Trail making A and B, Timed up and go (TUG)","timeFrame":"Approximately 3 months after stroke-BASELINE, after 6 and 9 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* oral and written consent\n* age 65+\n* clinical stroke ref WHO definition\n* home-dwelling previous to stroke\n* home-service less than twice a week previous to stroke\n* Barthel ADL-index \\>14 of 20\n* MMS \\>23 of 30\n* be able to communicate evaluated by Ulleval aphasia screening test\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* reduced consent\n* severe disease\n* clinical contradictions evaluated by the responsible physician","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Unni Sveen, PhD","affiliation":"Ullevaal University Hospital ,Medical division, research Unit 0407 Oslo Norway","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ullevaal University Hospital, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Research Unit","city":"Oslo","zip":"0407","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":59.91273,"lon":10.74609}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
