Patients with symptomatic large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation treated with MT resulting in a mTICI score 2b/3 on cerebral angiography will be enrolled in the angiosuite by interventionalists or neurologists once a mTICI 2b/3 is confirmed on cerebral angiography. Each included patient will be followed up to 90 days from the stroke. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with microvascular hypoperfusion on CT Perfusion at 36±24h. The key secondary outcome is the proportion of patients with a mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Mechanical Thrombectomy","Recanalization","Reperfusion","Alteplase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, blinded end-point assessment phase III trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The evaluation of the primary outcome measure (microvascular hypoperfusion on CTP) will be conducted at the Imaging Central Core Laboratory by blinded evaluators.
