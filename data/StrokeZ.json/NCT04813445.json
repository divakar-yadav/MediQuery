The primary hypothesis of this trial is that , Compared with the blank control group, Xingnaojing will produce serial changes in plasma and urine metabolites and biomarkers at baseline (pre-dose), 8 days and 11days . The serial changes may be the potential support to explain the intervention effect of Xingnaojing. All participants will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)entry score of 4-25. Participants who have planned or already received the intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment will be excluded. The primary outcome will be determined at 11 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Xingnaojing injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive intravenously administered Xingnaojing injection, combined with guidelines-based standard care.\n\nInterventions:\n\nDrug: Xingnaojing injection Other: Standard care","interventionNames":["Drug: Xingnaojing injection"]},{"label":"Standard care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects will receive guidelines-based standard care.\n\nInterventions:\n\nOther: Standard care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Xingnaojing injection","description":"Xingnaojing injection (20 ml)+0.9% diluted sodium chloride injection 250ml, IV (in the vein), every 12 hours for 10 days.","armGroupLabels":["Xingnaojing injection"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The change of NIHSS score","description":"The NIHSS score ranges from 0 (best score) to 42 (worst score).","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 days, 7 days and 10 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of NIHSS score from 0 to 1","description":"The NIHSS score ranges from 0 (best score) to 42 (worst score).","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 days, 7 days and 10 days"},{"measure":"Patient reported outcome (PRO) scale of stroke","description":"Patient reported outcome (PRO) scale of stroke at 10 days.The PRO score ranges from 0(worst score) to 180 (best score).","timeFrame":"10 days"},{"measure":"The proportion of patients independent at 30 days and 90 days","description":"The proportion of patients independent is defined as Modified Rankin Scale score of 0, 1, or 2.
