The main research questions are:\n\n1. Is VR-based script training a feasible treatment to Cantonese-speaking PWA?\n2. Will VR-based script training, when compared to conventional script training, better enhance treatment outcomes in functional communication of PWA?\n\nParticipants will be assessed before, in the middle of, immediately after treatment and 8-week post treatment in terms of their performance on:\n\n1. Accuracy and time for producing trained scripts.\n2. Accuracy and time for producing un-trained scripts\n3. Standardized aphasia test on severity of language impairment\n4. Standardized aphasia test on functional communication\n\nThe participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of the treatment:\n\n1. Virtual reality-based computerized script training; or\n2. Computerized script training without virtual reality Researchers will compare the treatment outcomes of the two treatment conditions and see if treatment with virtual reality would better promote outcomes when compared to training without virtual reality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia, Acquired","Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["functional communication","randomized study","script training","immersive virtual reality","aphasia intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VR-based script training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: VR-based script training"]},{"label":"Conventional script training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional script training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"VR-based script training","description":"The PWA will wear a head-mounted VR device (e.g., Metaverse Oculus Quest 2 or other commercially available devices) for 30 minutes, which intends to create an immersive environment for training.
