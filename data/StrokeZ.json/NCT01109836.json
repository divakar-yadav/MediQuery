The frequency of cognitive disturbances has been reported up to 30% and thus occurs three times more frequent than recurrent stroke (10%). Major attempts have been made to prevent the occurrence of new strokes by means of effective strategies including preventive drugs. In contrast, hardly any studies have been performed addressing the prevention of deteriorating cognitive function following a stroke. In spite of this high prevalence therapeutic possibilities are extremely limited. It must be expected that cognitive deficits become even a more frequent disability following stroke. This is caused by the increased aging of the population leading to further increase of incidence, furthermore that more people survive their acute stroke due to increased possibilities of acute treatment, and that frequent risk factors (e.g. hypertension, diabetes) are increasingly controlled, thus leading to less severe strokes with less severe and permanent motor deficits, but an increase of potentially disabling cognitive disturbances. The aim of this randomized controlled study is to test an intensive multiple intervention therapy for the first time in stroke and to add life style modifications targeting modifiable risk factors for cognitive deterioration.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the risk of post-stroke cognitive decline can be significantly reduced compared to a control group with standard care when using polyintervention. These interventions will focus on nutrition, exercise, cognitive and social activity and monitoring and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. Regular contacts with the subjects shall increase motivation and adherence to the study protocol."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Cognitive Decline","Dementia"],"keywords":["prevention","cognitive decline","post-stroke dementia","life-style intervention","vascular risk factors","polyintervention","multifactorial treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":202,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Motivation and lifestyle intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intensive control and motivation for better compliance with medication, regular blood pressure measurements, diet changes and physical activity.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motivation and lifestyle intervention"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard stroke care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motivation and lifestyle intervention","description":"Intensive control and motivation for better compliance with medication, regular blood pressure measurements, diet changes and physical activity.","armGroupLabels":["Motivation and lifestyle intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of persons having cognitively declined at 24 months","description":"Cognitive decline is defined as a significant decline in the composite scores of at least 2 of 5 neuropsychologically tested domains (speed of mental processing, executive functions, working memory, memory, spatial constructive functions).
