Blood samples for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics will be collected at every of the 6 study visits. Exercise tests (6/12-minutes walking test, 5xSST), transthoracic echocardiography, patient reported outcomes (e.g. Fatigue Severity Scale and Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale) will be assessed at prespecified visits. Patients will be provided with a diary to record timing of drug administration and clinical symptoms while not on site. Diaries will be reviewed and checked for compliance at each non-resident visit to the clinical site."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Primary Mitochondrial Disease"],"keywords":["Myopathy","Cardiomyopathy","Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome","Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)","Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) syndrome","GDF-15"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment with OMT-28","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"24mg OMT-28, oral capsule, for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: OMT-28"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"OMT-28","description":"once daily","armGroupLabels":["Treatment with OMT-28"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Responder rate","description":"Number of patients (responder rate) with a between phase difference in GDF-15 of at least 20% decrease","timeFrame":"12 weeks treatment vs. 12 weeks baseline"},{"measure":"Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)","description":"Compare the number of TEAEs during and between evaluation phases","timeFrame":"up to 28 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Responder rate","description":"Number of patients (responder rate) with a between phase difference in GDF-15 of at least 20%","timeFrame":"24 weeks treatment vs. 12 weeks baseline"},{"measure":"Change in plasma concentration of GDF-15 [ng/L]","description":"GDF-15 plasma concentration during evaluation phases, change in GDF-15 concentration during evaluations phases and comparison of GDF-15 concentration between evaluation phases","timeFrame":"12 weeks treatment vs. 12 weeks baseline"},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics: Ctrough [ng/ml]","description":"Trough plasma concentrations (Ctrough) of OMT-28","timeFrame":"weeks 12, 16, 24 and 28"},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics: Cmax [ng/ml]","description":"Plasma concentration of OMT-28 approximately at Cmax and one further timepoint after single dose","timeFrame":"week 12 and week 24"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
