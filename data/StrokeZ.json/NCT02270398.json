There is evidence showed that dual-task balance and gait performance is significantly impaired after stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests that dual-task balance and gait performance is useful for predicting falls among individuals with stroke. Considering the high clinical relevance of dual-task balance and gait performance, it is essential that stroke rehabilitation adequately addresses dual-task deficits.

After baseline evaluation, subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the three groups: (1) dual-task training group, (2) single-task training group, (3) strengthening and flexibility exercise group (controls), using a 1:1:1 randomization sequence.\n\nMeasurements Outcomes will be used to compare the therapeutic effects of the 3 treatment groups. The outcome measurements (except data on incidence of falls) will take place at 3 time points: (1) within one week before initiation of intervention (baseline), (2) within one week after completion of training, (3) 8 weeks after completion of training. The fall data will be collected on a monthly basis until 6 months after termination of the intervention period. All assessments will be performed by a researcher who is blinded to group allocation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Exercise","Balance","Gait","Community","Rehabilitation","Dual-task"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual-task training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will receive dual-task balance and gait training for half hour and relaxation exercise for another half hour in each session.
