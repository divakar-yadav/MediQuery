High blood pressure is an important risk factor for stroke. Lowering a person's blood pressure reduces the risk of future stroke or heart attack. However, the optimal target blood pressure after a person suffers a stroke is not known. This is a study designed to establish the feasibility of a larger clinical trial, the aim of which will be to find out if greater blood pressure lowering is safe and effective for patients who suffer a stroke.","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nStroke is the third leading cause of global death, the leading cause of acquired disability and contributes substantially to dementia, cognitive decline, and healthcare costs. Global epidemiological studies such as INTERSTROKE and the Global Burden of Disease study estimated that hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke, with a population attributable risk of approximately 50%. Recurrent vascular events (stroke, coronary events, vascular death) cause significant morbidity in ischaemic stroke survivors, affecting approximately 30% at 5 years. Blood-pressure reduction is a proven, inexpensive strategy to prevent stroke with benefits widely-generalizable in developed and developing countries. No randomised trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of SBP reduction to prevent secondary vascular events after ischaemic stroke to levels of about 120mmHg compared with 130-139mmHg. Consequently, most guidelines recommend reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 140mmHg.\n\nAim:\n\nThe aim is to conduct an initial pilot randomised trial in Ireland and 7 leading European centres involved in the European Stroke Organisation Trials Alliance. This feasibility study will assess key design aspects and establish trial governance, data management, and procedures in preparation for a larger definitive trial.\n\nMethods:\n\nDesign: Prospective, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed (PROBE) randomised, parallel-group pilot trial, comparing safety, efficacy, and other feasibility measures of two target SBP goals (intervention 115-125 mmHg, control 130-139 mmHg)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","transient ischemic attack","blood pressure","hypertension","recurrence","prognosis","prevention","randomized control trial","myocardial infarction","vascular events"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":122,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Target systolic blood pressure 115-125 mmHg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Recommended target SBP 115-125 millimetres of mercury (mmHg).","interventionNames":["Drug: anti-hypertensive"]},{"label":"Target systolic blood pressure 130-139 mmHg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Target SBP 130-139 mmHg (per American Stroke Association, European Stroke Organisation guidelines).","interventionNames":["Drug: anti-hypertensive"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"anti-hypertensive","description":"The recommended target SBP will be 115-125 mmHg in the intervention arm.
