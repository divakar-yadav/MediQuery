Stroke can lead to varying degrees of oropharyngeal dysphagia (25-85% of patients) and respiratory muscle dysfunction associated with an increase in medical complications such as bronchoaspiration, malnutrition and death. Dysphagia is present in a significant proportion of patients admitted to Rehabilitation (up to 85% depending on series) in stroke. Standard swallow therapy consists of educational intervention aimed to improve self-management of dysphagia and protect the airway, oral exercises to improve lingual praxis, and compensatory techniques based on videofluoroscopic findings. Recent studies suggest that IEMT can improve swallowing efficacy and reduce eventual bronchoaspiration events.\n\nNutritional status appears in 9-67% of patients with acute and subacute stroke and has an impact on functional outcomes and provides information about the risk of hospitalization and death. Stroke patients are at risk of developing malnutrition because of neurologic impairments related to feeding (chewing, deglutition and self-feeding) that can result in a poor food intake. To date, there is only few studies on prevalence and influence of malnutrition in stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Swallowing Disorder","Stroke","Respiratory Muscle Training","Malnutrition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High intensity IEMT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Inspiratory and expiratory muscle training + standard swallow therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: High intensity IEMT"]},{"label":"Sham IEMT","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham inspiratory and expiratory muscle training + standard swallow therapy","interventionNames":["Device: Sham IEMT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High intensity IEMT","description":"Training load will be the maximum inspiratory / expiratory load defined according to patient tolerance equivalent to 10 maximal repetitions (RM) as 10 consecutive inspirations / expirations (x 5 set), three times per day, during 8 weeks.
