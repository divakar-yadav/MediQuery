The participants will receive 9 sessions of electroacupuncture procedures for 3 weeks. Patients and outcome assessors will be blinded from the beginning to the study completion. Visual analogue scale will be primarily evaluated, and pain rating scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment upper extremity, modified Ashworth scale, manual muscle test, passive range of motion, Korean version of modified Barthel index, and Korean version of Beck depression inventory will be measured, too. Blinding index will be assessed.
