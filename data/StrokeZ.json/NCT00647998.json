A novel approach to ischemic neuroprotection is needed. Many patients who undergo cardiac, vascular, and neurosurgical procedures develop ischemic central nervous system (CNS) complications. These high risk surgeries present a unique opportunity to administer neuroprotectant medication prior to the injury, greatly increasing the likelihood that it will have a positive impact on outcomes. Patients undergoing descending thoracic aortic (DTA) and thoracoabdominal aortic (TAA) surgery have a particularly high rate of both brain and spine ischemia. In addition, these surgeries require placement of a lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain, allowing access to CSF in order to monitor markers of injury and penetration of medication into the CNS. We are performing a pilot dose finding trial of prophylactic darbepoetin alfa, a long-acting erythropoiesis medication with putative neuroprotectant properties, in patients undergoing DTA and TAA surgery.","detailedDescription":"Numerous neuroprotectants have been effective when given prior to ischemic stroke in animals, yet they have all have failed when given after ischemic stroke in humans.

We performed a pilot dose finding trial of prophylactic darbepoetin alfa, a long-acting erythropoiesis medication with putative neuroprotectant properties, in patients undergoing DTA and TAA surgery. This dose finding trial was stopped early after 9 patients were enrolled at the request of the FDA after an unrelated trial of erythropoietin in acute stroke performed in Germany was negative and showed possible harm in those patients who received intravenous tissue plasminogen activaor (tPA). We then enrolled 9 additional patients who did not receive any intervention in order to compare them to the patients who received darbepoetin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Ischemia","Stroke","Neuroprotection"],"keywords":["Surgical complications","Spinal ischemia","Stroke","Neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Darbepoetin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received 1mg/kg IV Darbepoetin immediately prior to surgery","interventionNames":["Drug: Darbepoetin alfa","Other: Standard care"]},{"label":"Standard care","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"No Darbepoetin","interventionNames":["Other: Standard care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Darbepoetin alfa","description":"Patients will receive one IV injection of Darbepoetin alfa at doses ranging from 1mcg/kg to 6.5 mcg/kg prior to surgery","armGroupLabels":["Darbepoetin"],"otherNames":["Aranesp"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard care","armGroupLabels":["Darbepoetin","Standard care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death or Neurologic Disability, Defined as an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)>4 or American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Lower Extermity Motor Score <25","description":"The NIHSS is a validated quasi-ordinal measure of stroke severity.
