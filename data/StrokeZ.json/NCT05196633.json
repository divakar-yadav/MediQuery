To date, it was used in various clinical trials as a training tool for promoting stance and balance improvement in several neurorehabilitation programs.\n\nAdditional outcomes focused on the effectiveness on pain intensity, clonus, passive range of motion, lower limb sensorimotor function, and functionality. The adverse events were also attentively monitored during the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke","Spastic Gait","Balance; Distorted"],"keywords":["stroke","spasticity","balance trainer","balance impairment","neurologic rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional physiotherapy, visual feedback training, rESWT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"conventional physiotherapy (5 times/week), visual feedback training (5 times/week), radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (once/week for 2 weeks)","interventionNames":["Other: radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional physiotherapy, visual feedback training, sham rESWT","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"conventional physiotherapy (5 times/week), visual feedback training (5 times/week), sham radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (once/week for 2 weeks)","interventionNames":["Other: sham radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy","description":"rESWT (Endopuls 811; Enraf Nonius B.V.
