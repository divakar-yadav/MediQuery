Secondly, PINGS II seeks to develop an implementation strategy for routine integration and policy adoption of mhealth for post-stroke BP control in a LMIC setting. The investigators will leverage experience gained from the NIH Global Brain Disorders funded R21 pilot study (NS094033) to test efficacy of a refined, culturally-tailored, and potentially implementable intervention aimed at addressing the premier modifiable risk for stroke \\& other key variables in an under-resourced system burdened by suboptimal care \\& outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Blood Pressure","Stroke","Cardiovascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PINGS 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: PINGS 2"]},{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"PINGS 2","description":"Home BP monitoring, medication reminders using phone alerts, and patient education on hypertension, cardiovascular risk reduction \\& stroke","armGroupLabels":["PINGS 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Systolic blood pressure","description":"Target goal of \\<140/90 mmHg measured at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12.
