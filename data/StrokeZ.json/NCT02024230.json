Similarly, anticoagulant therapy is essential for the prevention of cardiogenic embolism including cerebral infarction in AF patients. However, the combined antithrombotic therapy has been reported to increase the risk of major bleeding for AF patients after coronary stenting, New anticoagulant drugs that hardly interact with other drugs and do not need frequent blood tests have become commonly used. The purpose of this study is to assess the hypothesis that Rivaroxaban is non-inferior to Warfarin in the efficacy and safety for AF patients after coronary stenting"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease","Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Fetal Blood Loss","Major Bleeding","All Cause Mortality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rivaroxaban","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients were treated over a median of 4.75 years with either rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily for patients with a creatinine clearance of 15-49 mL/min or 15 mg once daily for patients with a creatinine clearance â‰¥50 mL/min)","interventionNames":["Drug: Rivaroxaban or Warfarin"]},{"label":"Warfarin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The dose of warfarin can be controlled with dose adjustment to achieve a target international normalized ratio \\[INR\\] of 2.0-3.0 or in patients aged \\>70 years and having a high bleeding risk, a target INR of 1.6-2.6) according to the guideline of Japanese Circulation Society based on the following paper (Inoue H, Okumura K, Atarashi H, Yamashita T, Origasa H, Kumagai N, et al.
