All four DOACs - apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban - were associated with lower risks of major bleeding compared to warfarin. Listed as core essential medicines by the World Health Organization, DOAC prescriptions have been surging worldwide. In Hong Kong, approximately 80,000 patients received DOACs from January 2009 through December 2022 according to the Hospital Authority registry.\n\nThe widespread DOAC usage had created DOAC-specific clinical dilemmas that lack evidence-based treatment despite twenty years of prescribing experience. Ischemic stroke despite DOAC (IS-DOAC), in particular, may occur in up to 6% of DOAC users annually. Due to the in vivo anticoagulation effect, there had been concerns of intracerebral bleeding (ICH) with intravenous thrombolytic therapy (IVT) for acute IS-DOAC. Under the current guideline recommendations, most acute IS-DOAC are contraindicated to IVT (see Intravenous thrombolytic therapy), which resulted in only a small proportion of acute ISDOAC patients being able to receive IVT even if presented early. Nonetheless, our group found that majority of patients had a DOAC level of \\<50ng/mL only 24 hours after DOAC cessation (see work done by us), a level deemed clinically negligible and safe for thrombolytic therapy. Together with evolving clinical evidence discussed below, IS-DOAC patients maybe unnecessarily barred from IVT, thus compromised functional recovery.\n\nWith robust pharmacokinetic and retrospective clinical evidence to support, it is hypothesized that IVT are safe in IS-DOAC patient. The investigators hereby propose a prospective multicenter study to determine the efficacy and safety of IVT in acute IS-DOAC.","detailedDescription":"In this prospective cohort study, the investigators aim to recruit consecutive DOAC users with IS-DOAC who meet the inclusion criteria. The investigators aim to determine the safety and efficacy of IVT among DOAC patients with acute ischemic stroke. It is hypothesized that compared to a matched cohort of patients with acute IS-DOAC excluded from IVT, IVT in IS-DOAC patients with a last-DOAC-ingestion of 12-48 hours improves neurological outcomes with an acceptable safety profile."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":260,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IVT group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"For patients enrolled into the IVT group from participating centers that allow IVT in patients with last DOAC intake 12-48 hours before presentation (PWH, QEH, QMH, UCH, TMH): Either alteplase (0.6 or 0.9mg/kg, maximum dosage 90mg, intravenous infusion) or tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum dosage 25mg, intravenous infusion) will be given at discretion of the treating physician.","interventionNames":["Drug: alteplase or tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"For patients enrolled into the control group from participating centers that exclude eligible patients from IVT (PMH, PYNEH): no IVT will be given unless specific antidote can be administered before IVT."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"alteplase or tenecteplase","description":"Either alteplase (0.6 or 0.9mg/kg, maximum dosage 90mg) or tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum dosage 25mg) will be given","armGroupLabels":["IVT group"],"otherNames":["tPA or TNK"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Presence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)","description":"As primary safety outcome.
