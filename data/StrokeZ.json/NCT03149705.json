Stroke is characterized by a cerebral parenchymal lesion due to an ischemic mechanism (85% of the cases) or hemorrhagic mechanism (15%). For a long time, the only approved treatment was the intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA). Recently, thrombectomy has proven its superiority in this pathology.\n\nCohorts of patients with stroke are rare but can be very valuable by their clinical, laboratory and imaging well documented. They are the source of new hypotheses for research or interventions as well as the quality of care assessment tool.\n\nThe main objective of this project is to identify new markers: biological and imaging, treatment response and prognosis after ischemic stroke.\n\nSecondary objectives of the HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort are to establish a clinical database, completed by biological samples and by imaging data that can be used in the following areas:\n\n* Descriptive epidemiology of ischemic stroke and cerebral reperfusion,\n* Pharmacoepidemiology and treatments observatory: safety, efficacy, indication of treatment in real life, costs\n* Assessment of the long-term effect of the treatment on the occurrence of disability, stroke recurrence and death,\n* Quality of life and personal, familial, professional and social consequences of stroke,\n* Research of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers,\n* Research projects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
