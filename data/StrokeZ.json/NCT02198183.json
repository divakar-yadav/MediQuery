We also hypothesize that cardiac output usually is well maintained under GA in the sitting position when epinephrine is used, but that decreased cardiac output increases the risk of cerebral desaturation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Near-infrared spectroscopy","description":"Casmed Fore-Sight Elite and Non-invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM)","interventionNames":["Device: Casmed Fore-Sight Elite","Device: Non-invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Casmed Fore-Sight Elite","armGroupLabels":["Near-infrared spectroscopy"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Non-invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM)","armGroupLabels":["Near-infrared spectroscopy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Cerebral Desaturation Events","description":"The number of Cerebral Desaturation Events (CDE) that occured.
