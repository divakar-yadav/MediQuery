Consecutive patients treated with endovascular stroke treatment will be enrolled in German stroke centers. Patients receive regular care and data will be collected as part of clinical routine. Baseline clinical and procedural information as well clinical follow-up information during in-hospital stay, and up to 90 days of stroke onset are collected. Data collected include demographics, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, pre-treatment ASPECTS, information on timing and success of interventional treatment, procedural complications, intracranial hemorrhage, and functional outcome. Advanced imaging biomarkers will be tested and validated aiming to improve treatment selection and outcome prediction of patients presenting with extensive baseline infarction.","detailedDescription":"This study aims to investigate the role of advanced imaging biomarkers in patients with large early infarct, in particular quantitative lesion water uptake (Minnerup et al. Annals of Neurology 2016), arterial and venous collateral circulation (Faizy et al. Radiology 2021), and multivariate CTP-derived parameters (Kemmling et al. JCBFM 2015). The goal is to use these imaging biomarkers as specific selection criterion to predict clinical benefit after reperfusion despite extensive baseline infarct lesions, also as a method of monitoring adjuvant neuroprotective agents after reperfusion therapy (for instance anti-edematous medication)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Patients with an ASPECTS of 0-5 on baseline neuroimaging undergoing thrombectomy","description":"acute stroke patients treated with endovascular treatment combined with thrombolysis or without previous thrombolysis Intervention.","interventionNames":["Other: Telephone call on day 90","Diagnostic Test: Quantification of lesion water uptake by CT densitometry"]},{"label":"Stroke Patients with an ASPECTS of 0-5 on baseline neuroimaging not undergoing thrombectomy","description":"acute stroke patients treated with or without thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Other: Telephone call on day 90","Diagnostic Test: Quantification of lesion water uptake by CT densitometry"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Telephone call on day 90","description":"telephone call on day 90 to assess the primary outcome (mRs 90)","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Patients with an ASPECTS of 0-5 on baseline neuroimaging not undergoing thrombectomy","Stroke Patients with an ASPECTS of 0-5 on baseline neuroimaging undergoing thrombectomy"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Quantification of lesion water uptake by CT densitometry","description":"Retrospective quantification of lesion water uptake by CT densitometry in admission and follow-up imaging","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Patients with an ASPECTS of 0-5 on baseline neuroimaging not undergoing thrombectomy","Stroke Patients with an ASPECTS of 0-5 on baseline neuroimaging undergoing thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified ranking scale on day (mRs) day 90","description":"mRs: modified ranking scale; the scale is a commonly used measurement for the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke; scale range 0-6, with 0 - No symptoms. 1 - No significant disability.
