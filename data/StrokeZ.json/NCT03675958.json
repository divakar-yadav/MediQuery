Also it is used the Johnstone´s Pressure Splint (JPS), which exerts circumferential pressure and contribute to spastic pattern inhibition, sensory re-education and increased of the mobility.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the immediate effect of JPS added to S on the spasticity of elbow flexors and wrist, the reflex excitability and the joint kinematics in Stroke.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized experimental study with two intervention groups will be performed. Control group (GS): Stretching and experimental group: (GJPS + S): JPS plus S. Measurement times: Before the intervention (T0) and immediately post- intervention (T1). The outcome variables are muscle tone of elbow, wrist and hand assessed with the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS); H reflex of the Flexor Carpi Radialis muscle, latency (ms), duration (ms) and amplitude (mV) of the M and H waves, and the amplitude the Hmax / Mmax ratio (%). Shoulder, elbow and trunk angles (degrees), trunk displacement (cm) and duration (sec) of the Functional Reach Pattern (PAF) will be evaluated with the software Contemplas.\n\nANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics will be applied and Shapiro Wilk test to evaluate the normality of the variables. Intra-group differences will be assessed with the student t-test paired and intergroup with the student t-test unpaired or the sum of Wilcoxon rank according to the distribution of the variables.\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS: Hypotheses and contributions to the scientific evidence on the immediate effect of the S and JPS will be generated, to support the JPS as a complement to the traditional treatment. The results will be socialized in an international scientific event and a publication will be submitted to an impact journal.\n\nKEY WORDS: Spasticity, H Reflex, Johnstone's Pressure Splint, Stretching, Functional Reach."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke"],"keywords":["H Reflex","Johnstone's Pressure Splint","Stretching","Functional Reach","Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomized experimental study with two intervention groups will be performed.
