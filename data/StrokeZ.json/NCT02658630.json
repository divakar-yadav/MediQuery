The expectation is the development of a formula to predict a person's response to an arm rehabilitation program provided in the chronic phase (6 months or greater post stroke) of recovery. The study will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), genetic testing using blood and saliva, and an arm exercise program consisting of robot-assisted exercise combined with functional arm exercise called transition to task training (TTT).","detailedDescription":"After informed consent, a baseline neurological exam, medical records review, MRI of the brain, TMS, questionnaires, cognitive testing, robot evaluations, and arm function testing will occur. Baseline testing will occur in the first 4-6 weeks of participation including two separate sessions approximately 1 week a part to examine arm strength, range of motion, and ability to perform functional tasks, with one additional session if needed to verify stability between results. Additionally, one robot evaluation, one MRI, and one TMS session will be completed. We will also collect genetic data using blood and saliva samples to examine potential RNA expression and genetic polymorphisms that might influence response to therapy.\n\nThe intervention phase consists of 12 weeks of robot and transition to task arm exercise training (TTT). Interventions will occur approximately 3 times per week for 12 weeks for a total of 36 visits. Additional time and visits will be allowed with visits occurring 4 times per week or up to 6 additional weeks (not to exceed 18 weeks) if scheduling conflicts arise. The intervention sessions will be one hour in duration.\n\nDuring the hour-long intervention, 45 minutes of robotic intervention will be followed by 15 minutes of TTT. Two separate robots targeting different movements will be used for the 3 phases of the robot training. The training will be sequential with 12 sessions completed on the wrist robot, followed by 12 sessions on the shoulder-elbow robot and the final 12 sessions alternating between the wrist and elbow-shoulder robot.\n\nAfter the final training session, subjects will return after a 12 week retention period. At various time points during and after the intervention phase there will be additional arm function testing, robot evaluations, questionnaires, blood draws, and TMS sessions to re-assess ability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["arm rehabilitation","recovery of function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The outcomes assessor is masked as to the prediction model and to particulars of performance during the intervention, but knows that there is a single group design."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Device: Robot + TTT Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will be enrolled in this group to receive the same 60 minute study intervention consisting of wrist and shoulder-elbow robot training and TTT arm exercises.","interventionNames":["Device: Robot + TTT exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robot + TTT exercise","description":"The intervention will be completed 36 visits approximately 3x/week for 12-18 weeks.
