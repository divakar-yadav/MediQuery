Those effects are difficult to achieve with standard rehabilitation therapy. The Kinect system is a camera-based controller which a player can use to directly control a game through body movement without the need for handheld controllers. Using Kinect to capture movement is a feasible way to help patients who have difficulties to hold controllers to play exergames. Scratch 2.0 is a programming language for kids from the MIT Media Laboratory. It is easy to use for game designing. Kinect2Scratch allows data from the Microsoft Kinect controller to be sent to Scratch, This means that game programs can be designed with motion control. The aims of this study were to i) develop exergames by using Scratch and Kinect system for training upper extremity function in patient with stroke; and ii) to test the game's feasibility and effects in a group of patient with chronic stroke.\n\nThis program will be done within two years. During the first year, investigators will design several exergames which are suitable for training upper extremity function in patient with stroke. Investigators will have several experts meetings, involved by physiatrists, occupational therapists and engineers to design the game. When a prototype game is created, investigators will invite two to four patients with stroke to pilot test the game. The game design will be completed till patients and therapists satisfy the design.\n\nDuring the 2nd year, investigators will test the feasibility and effects of the exergames by doing a pilot randomized control trial. Investigators will recruit 60 patients with chronic stroke who are admitted to a rehabilitation ward for outpatient rehabilitation, and will randomize participants to experiment or control group. All participants will receive PT and OT training as routine. The additional intervention either exergames or conventional OT will be delivered for 8 weeks with 3 training sessions/week of up to 30 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Kinect","Rehabilitation","Upper limbs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to the experimental group participate in exergames training with Kinect.
