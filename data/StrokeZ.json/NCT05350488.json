The investigators will engage participants in both urban and rural Alabama through informational interviews and work to find common themes to address so that future interventions are useful to their unique needs and desires. This goes beyond simply identifying barriers and endeavors to discovering solutions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Disability Physical","Patient Satisfaction","Caregiver Burden"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Continuum"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Survivors <1 year","description":"Group A will include participants that are less than 1 year out from their most recent stroke.","interventionNames":["Other: Informational Interview"]},{"label":"Stroke Survivors >1 year","description":"Group B will include participants that are greater than 1 year out from their most recent","interventionNames":["Other: Informational Interview"]},{"label":"Caregivers","description":"Group C will include participants' identified caregivers.","interventionNames":["Other: Focus Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Informational Interview","description":"Interview topics will fall in the broad categories of assessing medical knowledge and understanding of stroke, knowledge of medical and community resources, understanding and experience of post-stroke rehabilitation barriers faced upon reintegrating back home and ability to continue management of stroke diagnosis and suggestions for improvement.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Survivors <1 year","Stroke Survivors >1 year"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Focus Group","description":"Focus group topics will fall into the same broad categories as the informational interviews, however will be asked from a caregiver's perspective","armGroupLabels":["Caregivers"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of recruitment and retention","description":"The investigators will screen 60-100 individuals with the goal of enrolling a total of 20 AA (African American) stroke survivors +/- their identified caregivers.
