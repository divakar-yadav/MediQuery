Half of acute stroke patients have elevated glucose levels upon admission to the hospital, and hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcome for post-stroke patients. It is unclear if treatment of hyperglycemia or glucose lowering improves outcome, however, in animal stroke models and other human conditions, aggressive glucose lowering is beneficial.\n\nThe goal of this multicenter trial is to determine if tight control of blood glucose is beneficial in hyperglycemic patients with acute ischemic stroke. In the trial, researchers will compare intravenous (IV) glucose insulin and potassium (GIK) therapy plus meal insulin to control therapy in 72 stroke patients.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups-(1) the control group with a target glucose level of \\<300mg/dL; (2) the tight control GIK plus meal insulin group with a target of \\<110mg/dL; or (3) the loose control GIK plus meal insulin group with a target of \\<200mg/dL-with all groups avoiding glucose levels of \\<70mg/dL.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are to collect preliminary data on the safety and feasibility of GIK for treatment of hyperglycemia in acute stroke patients, and to collect preliminary data comparing tight GIK therapy with loose GIK therapy and control therapy. Information learned in this study will compliment ongoing work and allow for maximum efficiency in the design of future treatment trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hyperglycemia"],"keywords":["stroke","acute ischemic stroke","hyperglycemia","glucose","insulin","insulin and potassium therapy","GIK"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":74,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tight control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"target glucose level 70-110 mg/dL","interventionNames":["Drug: IV glucose insulin and potassium, GIK"]},{"label":"loose control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"target glucose level 70 - 200 mg/dL","interventionNames":["Drug: IV glucose insulin and potassium, GIK"]},{"label":"usual care group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"target level 70 - 300 mg/dL","interventionNames":["Other: standard care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"IV glucose insulin and potassium, GIK","description":"The treatment intervention includes glucose, insulin, potassium infusion or standard therapy.","armGroupLabels":["loose control group","tight control group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"standard care","description":"usual care","armGroupLabels":["usual care group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hypoglycemic Events","description":"hypoglycemic events","timeFrame":"up to 5 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Favorable 3 Month Modified Rankin","description":"3 month functional outcomes by modified Rankin (0 to 1) dichotomized as favorable versus not favorable outcome.
