Each participant will complete 12 sessions (three times a week for four weeks) of either INCLINE, DECLINE, or CONTROL training. Clinical and biomechanical outcome measures will be collected pre- and post-training and after a one-month follow-up period. In addition, the investigators will collect a battery of clinical outcome measures before and after training. Spatiotemporal variables (including SSWS) will be collected before and after each session. All clinical and biomechanical assessments will be conducted by an evaluator blinded to training group allocation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Walking","Biomechanics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Personalized training effect on SSWS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Determine the efficacy of motor control deficit guided personalized training on SSWS compared to non-personalized and CONTROL interventions.\n\nIncline treadmill walking Decline treadmill walking","interventionNames":["Other: Incline treadmill walking","Other: Decline treadmill walking"]},{"label":"Personalized training effect on Pp","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Determine the efficacy of motor control deficit guided personalized training on increasing symmetry of Pp compared to non-personalized and CONTROL interventions.\n\nIncline treadmill walking Decline treadmill walking","interventionNames":["Other: Incline treadmill walking","Other: Decline treadmill walking"]},{"label":"Positive response","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Determine if the personalized intervention increase the positive response rate compared to non-personalized and CONTROL interventions, and to further advance personalize interventions by identifying factors that predict response.\n\nIncline treadmill walking Decline treadmill walking","interventionNames":["Other: Incline treadmill walking","Other: Decline treadmill walking"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Incline treadmill walking","description":"Those with a Pp 0.47 will undergo INCLINE training during which individuals will walk for 15 minutes at a 10-degree treadmill tilt, stopping each five minutes for monitoring of vital signs.","armGroupLabels":["Personalized training effect on Pp","Personalized training effect on SSWS","Positive response"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Decline treadmill walking","description":"Those with a Pp 0.53 will undergo DECLINE training during which individuals will walk for 15 minutes at a 10-degree treadmill tilt, stopping each five minutes for monitoring of vital signs.","armGroupLabels":["Personalized training effect on Pp","Personalized training effect on SSWS","Positive response"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Gait Speed","description":"10 Meter Walk Test","timeFrame":"Pre (same day but prior to initial training session) and post (immediately following final training session) approximately 4 weeks apart, and follow-up at 1 month after the last training session."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Paretic Propulsion Symmetry","description":"Quantitative measure of the coordinated output of the paretic leg and is defined as the percentage of propulsion performed by the paretic leg.","timeFrame":"Pre (same day but prior to initial training session) and post (immediately following final training session) approximately 4 weeks apart, and follow-up at 1 month after the last training session."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke 6 months\n* residual paresis in the lower extremity (Fugl-Meyer LE motor score \\<34)\n* ability to walk without assistance at speeds ranging from 0.2 - 1.0 m/s (with a support harness for biomechanical testing)\n* Pp between 0.47 and 0.53\n* Ability to walk on a treadmill without orthotic or assistive device using overhead harness system\n* provision of informed consent, and 8) written approval from the primary physician (see attached sample of Medical Approval Cover Letter).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* history of congestive heart failure, unstable cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, angina or dyspnea at rest or during ADLs\n* History of COPD or oxygen dependence\n* Pre-existing neurological disorders or dementia\n* History of major head trauma\n* Legal blindness or severe visual impairment\n* Severe arthritis or other problems that limit passive ROM\n* History of DVT or pulmonary embolism within 6 months\n* Severe hypertension with systolic \\>200 mmHg and diastolic \\>110 mmHg at rest.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mark Goodman Bowden, PhD MPT","affiliation":"Ralph H.
