Patients with transient ischemic attack(TIA) or stroke have a high prevalence of sleep apnea(60-80%), and they are at high risk of cardiovascular events(myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, recurrent stroke, and cardiovascular death)in the first year post event, despite current prevent strategies. Therefore, the treatment of sleep apnea may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in this high risk population.","detailedDescription":"The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial among patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke, comparing strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea with usual care over 6-12 months at 2 sites (Yale University School of Medicine and Indiana University School of Medicine). Patients with TIA and minor stroke will be randomly assigned to either usual care or a diagnosis and treatment approach that includes ambulatory polysomnography and initiation of autotitrating CPAP for sleep apnea in a 1:2 (control:intervention) randomization scheme. Intervention patients with sleep apnea will receive either a standard CPAP treatment intervention or an enhanced protocol designed to increase long-term CPAP adherence. The primary outcomes will include: (a) the impact of CPAP on pathophysiologic markers in the following domains of cardiovascular risk: inflammation (CRP, Il-6), heightened sympathetic activity/parasympathetic withdrawal (plasma catecholamines and heart rate variability (HRV)), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, HbA1C), endothelial injury (flow mediated vasodilation), and atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness); and (b) long-term (6-12 month) CPAP adherence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transient Ischemic Attack","Stroke"],"keywords":["Sleep Apnea","CPAP adherence","behavioral adherence","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":255,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group gets unattended sleep study, auto titrating CPAP, and standard CPAP support.","interventionNames":["Device: Standard CPAP Intervention"]},{"label":"Enhanced CPAP intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group gets an unattended sleep study, autotitrating CPAP, and enhanced CPAP support.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Enhanced CPAP Intervention"]},{"label":"Usual Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"This group usual care after TIA/stroke and a sleep study at the end of the study."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Standard CPAP Intervention","armGroupLabels":["Standard Intervention group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Enhanced CPAP Intervention","armGroupLabels":["Enhanced CPAP intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"HOMA IR Change From Baseline","description":"The homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
