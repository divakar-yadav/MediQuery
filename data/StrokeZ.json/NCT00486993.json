More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. An estimated 17.5 million people died from CVDs in 2005, representing 30% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.6 million were due to coronary heart disease and 5.7 million were due to stroke.\n\nOver 80% of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries and occur almost equally in men and women. In Paraguay, prevalence of classic risk factors, as well as new ones, like the metabolic syndrome are not completely known.\n\nGovernment health policies in industrialized countries are focusing on programs to modify cardiovascular risk factors. In developing countries, prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke through modification of cardiovascular risk factors are not playing a large role at the moment.\n\nThe aim of this study is to define the effects of changes in lifestyle on cardiovascular risk factors, when added to optimized standard pharmacological therapy for arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, in an ambulatory urban patient population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Risk Factors","Metabolic Syndrome","Lifestyle Modification","Coronary Artery Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["Diet","Exercise","Smoking","Stress","Polyphenols"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18287,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"asuriesgo","description":"unselected outpatient population","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Dietary and nutritional modification","Behavioral: Stop smoking","Behavioral: Regular physical activities","Behavioral: Weight reduction to normal ranges","Behavioral: Regular intake of polyphenols, esp. from Ilex paraguayensis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Dietary and nutritional modification","armGroupLabels":["asuriesgo"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Stop smoking","armGroupLabels":["asuriesgo"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Regular physical activities","armGroupLabels":["asuriesgo"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Weight reduction to normal ranges","armGroupLabels":["asuriesgo"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Regular intake of polyphenols, esp. from Ilex paraguayensis","armGroupLabels":["asuriesgo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"cardiovascular mortality","timeFrame":"one year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mortality, other causes","timeFrame":"one year"},{"measure":"acute myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"one year"},{"measure":"stroke","timeFrame":"one year"},{"measure":"acute coronary syndrome","timeFrame":"one year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* all ambulatory patients, with age 18 years or older\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* no exclusion criteria provided, particularly for the first, epidemiological part of the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"unselected outpatient population","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Derliz Mereles, MD","affiliation":"Heidelberg University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital Central Instituto de Prevision Social","city":"Asuncion","state":"Dep.
