Stroke results in focal signs and symptoms, with a devastating impact on a patient and his family. Although robotic rehabilitation is very useful in improving motor function, there is no a clear evidence on its role in improving cognitive abilities, which are often compromised in stroke patients.\n\nTo this end, the investigators designed a randomized controlled experimental study on stroke patients, with the aim of evaluating the effects of robotic neurorehabilitation using Lokomat with and without virtual reality on cognitive functioning in stroke patients, compared to traditional therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognition Disorders"],"keywords":["Lokomat","Robotic rehab","Executive function","VR"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic Treatment plus VR","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients included will be divided into three groups of 30 patients each.
