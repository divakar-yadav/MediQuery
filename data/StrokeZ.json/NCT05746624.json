However, some people who recover from acute COVID-19 infections report lingering symptoms. This is called long COVID. Many people with long COVID report symptoms related to the nervous system; these can include problems with fatigue, speech, and memory.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test motor memory in people with long COVID, compared to healthy volunteers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 to 90 years who are also enrolled in study protocol 000089. Healthy adults are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened by telephone. They will confirm they are able to type without discomfort using their nondominant hand. They will confirm they have access to a computer connected to the internet.\n\nAll study tasks will be done online. Participants will complete 2 tasks in 2 days.\n\nParticipants will be sent a link to a website. The website will give them instructions. They will place the fingers of their nondominant hand over 4 numbers on the keyboard and type a sequence (eg, 4-1-3-2-4). They will type this sequence as often as they can in 10 seconds. Then they will rest for 10 seconds before repeating the task. They will repeat this pattern for 15 minutes.\n\nAfter they finish the typing task, participants will take a 10-minute questionnaire. They will answer questions about their experiences with COVID-19 and memory issues; they will say which hand they use for tasks such as brushing their teeth or throwing a ball.\n\nParticipants will get a notice to repeat the typing task 22 hours after they finish the first one. They should complete the second task within 28 hours....","detailedDescription":"This study will objectively test procedural motor memory in a group of people with ongoing symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19 infection.\n\nPrimary Objective: We will use a keyboard typing task to investigate procedural memory formation (primary endpoint measure) in the context of COVID-19 infection. We have two\n\nprimary comparisons using the same outcome measure\n\n* To compare procedural memory formation between patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection ( long COVID ) and matched controls who deny symptoms of long COVID (as reported in self-report questionnaires).\n* To compare procedural memory formation between long COVID patients with memory complaints and long COVID patients without memory complaints.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nMicro-online gains, micro-offline gains, and long-term consolidation (all secondary measures) will be investigated\n\n* between patients with long COVID and matched controls.\n* between long COVID patients with memory complaints and long COVID patients without memory complaints\n\nExploratory objectives: To compare primary and secondary outcome measures between long COVID patients and healthy controls who report prior COVID-19 infection but are not suffering long COVID symptoms\n\nPrimary endpoint measure: Early procedural memory formation, as measured by the difference in tapping speed (keypresses/second) between the first and last correct training trial of early learning (first 11 trials) in a keyboard task.\n\nSecondary endpoint measures:\n\nMicro-online learning. Performance improvements within training trials\n\nMicro-offline learning (rapid consolidation). Performance improvements during rest intervals interspersed with training periods.\n\nLonger-term consolidation (24 hours). Performance improvements between the last training trial of Day 1 and the testing trial of Day 2. We hypothesize that early procedural motor memory learning will be reduced in long COVID patients as compared to healthy controls\n\n(primary hypothesis). Seondarily, we hypothesize that micro-online learning, micro-offline learning (rapid consolidation), and longer term consolidation (24 hours) will be also reduced in long COVID patients as compared to controls."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Infectious Metabolic Encephalopathy","Ischemic Stroke","Seizure","Viral Encephalitis, Small and Large Vessel"],"keywords":["Corona Virus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1 Long COVID left handed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Long COVID left handed","interventionNames":["Behavioral: keypresses"]},{"label":"Arm 1 Long COVID right handed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Long COVID right handed","interventionNames":["Behavioral: keypresses"]},{"label":"Arm 2 Healthy Controls left handed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"healthy left handed","interventionNames":["Behavioral: keypresses"]},{"label":"Arm 2 Healthy Controls right handed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"healthy right handed","interventionNames":["Behavioral: keypresses"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"keypresses","description":"benign behavioral intervention-- keypresses","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1 Long COVID left handed","Arm 1 Long COVID right handed","Arm 2 Healthy Controls left handed","Arm 2 Healthy Controls right handed"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To investigate differences in procedural memory formation and consolidation during a keyboard typing task between o patients withpersistent symptoms following COVID- 19 infection ( long COVID )and matched controls who deny symptoms of ...","description":"Early procedural motor memory learning will be measuredby the difference in keypress speed between the first training trial and last correct training trial of the Day 1 typing task.","timeFrame":"anticipated to complete data analysis by December 2023"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, patient volunteers must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nAbility of subject to understand and the willingness to review an informed consent\n\nAged at least 18 years at the time of enrollment, and no older than 90 years of age.\n\nIdentity of dominant hand\n\n1.
