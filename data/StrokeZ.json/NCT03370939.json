Whether the benefit of EVT in randomized trials could be generalized to clinical practice, especially in developing countries, remains unknown. The prospective Chinese ANGEL-ACT Registry (Endovascular Treatment Key Technique and Emergency Work Flow Improvement of Acute Ischemic Stroke) was established to evaluate the utilization, and subsequent outcomes of EVT treated AIS patients. This study is a multi-center, prospective registry study initiated by researchers, funded by National Key R\\&D Program of China. A total of 2,000 patients with acute ischemic stroke will undergo endovascular treatment. The hypothesis was that favorable outcomes from clinical trials could be achieved in clinical practice in China."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Artery Occlusion With Infarction (Disorder)"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","endovascular treatment","registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2004,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional independence at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale of 0-2)","description":"The range of modified Rankin Scale was from 0 to 6. 0-No symptoms;1-No significant disability;2-Slight disability;3-Moderate disability;4-Moderately severe disability;5-Severe disability;6 -Dead.A higher score indicates worse a outcome.","timeFrame":"90±7 days after enrollment"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 12-36 hours after the procedure","description":"Heidelberg Bleeding Classification): new intracranial hemorrhage detected by brain imaging associated with ≥4 points total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), ≥2 points in one NIHSS category, leading to intubation/ hemicraniectomy/ EVD placement or other major medical/surgical intervention, or absence of alternative explanation for deterioration","timeFrame":"12-36 hours after the procedure"},{"measure":"Time from symptom onset to recanalization","timeFrame":"The end of the procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recanalization rate at the end of the procedure","description":"mTICI score 2b-3","timeFrame":"at the end of the procedure"},{"measure":"Recanalization rate after the first attempt","description":"mTICI score 2b-3","timeFrame":"At baseline, during the procedure, after the first attempt of endovascular treatment"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS score immediately after the procedure","description":"difference between NIHSS score immediately after the procedure and baseline","timeFrame":"within 2 hours after the procedure"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS score 24 hours after the procedure","description":"difference between NIHSS score 24 hours after the procedure and baseline","timeFrame":"24 hours after the procedure"},{"measure":"Changes in NIHSS score 7 days after the procedure or at discharge","description":"difference between NIHSS score 7 days after the procedure or discharge and baseline","timeFrame":"7 days after the procedure or discharge"},{"measure":"EQ-5D 90 days after the procedure","description":"EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status.
