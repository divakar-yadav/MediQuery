The majority of patients do not recover functional use of their paretic upper limb.\n\nThe use of mirror therapy allows the activation of the mirror neurons involved to stimulate brain plasticity after brain damage.The IVS (Intensive Visual Stimulation) device allows an easy implementation of mirror therapy by filming the valid upper limb and projecting the inverted image onto a screen placed above the parietal arm thus producing the illusion of movement of the parietal arm.\n\nThe main hypothesis of this study is that the structured practice of a large number of upper limb targeted movement repetitions using an intensive visual numerical simulation device as a partial replacement for routine care (conventional occupational therapy) in the sub-acute phase of stroke will increase the active function (motor function and functional abilities) of the distal end of the upper limb compared to conventional rehabilitation.\n\nObjectives: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of partial substitution of routine care (occupational therapy) by structured movement repetition programs by Intensive Visual Simulation using an IVS3 device, on the distal motor control of the upper hemiparesis limb, between 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, compared to a program with conventional care alone.","detailedDescription":"Hemiparesis is a common motor disorder after a stroke. The majority of patients do not reuse their paretic upper limb.\n\nHypothesis: The structured practice of repeating upper limb movements by Intensive Visual Simulation will increase distal motor control, and improve the objective functional abilities of the upper limb.\n\nMain Objective:Evaluate in a controlled protocol the effects, on the distal motor control of the upper hemiparesis limb, between 4 and 10 weeks after stroke, of 6 weeks of partial substitution of routine care (occupational therapy) by structured movement repetition programs by Intensive Visual Simulation using an IVS3 device, compared to 6 weeks of a program involving only conventional rehabilitation care, in a population of moderate to severe hemiparesis stroke patients in subacute phase.\n\nDevice Description: The IVS3 (Intensive Visual Simulation) rehabilitation device, marketed by Dessintey, allows the implementation of intensive mirror therapy by making it more immersive, ergonomic, and accessible. The IVS3 device consists of a hollow table adjustable in height, a touch screen dedicated to the therapist to set up the device and a large screen adjustable in height and sliding laterally to overlap the upper limb and thus allow the illusion that the limb visible on the screen is the paretic upper limb.\n\nMethods: Multicentric randomised controlled Trial.\n\nRisk/Constraint: To our knowledge, this research does not involve any risks other than those of daily life. The medical device will be used under normal conditions of use as described in the user manual. No contraindications are specified for this device. A risk of discomfort may be felt by the patient during the first few minutes of use. Possibility of feeling tired.\n\nResearch duration : 3 years Duration of patient participation : 18 weeks"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","mirror therapy","rehabilitation","hemiparesis","upper limb","function","motor control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"at least 4 sessions/week for 6 weeks, from 1 hour of conventional upper limb rehabilitation by an occupational therapist.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Intensive Visual Simulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"at least 4 sessions/week for 6 weeks, of 1 hour of upper limb rehabilitation including 45 minutes of conventional rehabilitation (occupational therapy) and 15 minutes of work with a medical device allowing intensive visual digital simulation.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional rehabilitation","Device: Intensive Visual Simulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional rehabilitation","description":"upper limb rehabilitation involving submaximal passive amplitude stretching movements, inhibition postures, active efforts assisted of varying difficulty, target approach exercises with or without elbow support and gripping tasks, adapted to the upper limb's paresis abilities.
