The aim of the study is to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of mirror therapy and EMS in stroke patients and compare the outcomes with CIMT.","detailedDescription":"Stroke or CVA is the sudden death of the brain cells due to inadequate blood flow, it's a focal disturbance of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting for 24hrs or longer or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than of vascular origin. The commonest consequence of stroke is loss of upper limb function. The protocol planned for improving the function of the upper limb is mirror therapy combined with EMS and compare with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) treatment in stroke patients Many works done on CIMT and mirror therapy in rehabilitation prove to be powerful tools for upper limbs in people with stroke. Different studies concluded that CIMT is more effective than Mirror Therapy (MT) in the upper extremity in stroke patients. An RCT was published in 2019 in which mirror therapy combined with electrical stimulation proves to be effective in stroke patients. However, I have not found a study comparing EMS combined with Mirror therapy compared to CIMT treatment in stroke patients. According to the Alternate hypothesis mirror therapy combined with EMS has beneficial effects on clinical outcomes in upper limb stroke patients. According to the null hypothesis, CIMT has better results in stroke patients as compared to EMS combined with Mirror therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Electrical muscle stimulation","Constraint induced movement therapy","Mirror therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is an randomized control trail in which the stroke patients are divided into three different treatment group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The participant were blinded about the treatment group in which they are enrolled.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will be given Mirror therapy along with the electrical muscle stimulation and exercises.","interventionNames":["Other: EMS, Mirror therapy & exercises"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will be given constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) along with exercises.","interventionNames":["Other: CIMT & exercises"]},{"label":"Group C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will be given mirror therapy and exercises.","interventionNames":["Other: Mirror therapy & exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"EMS, Mirror therapy & exercises","description":"EMS will be applied with frequency between 20-100 Hz and pulse width between 20 to 450us and Mirror therapy for 30 minutes and four days per week for a total duration of 12 weeks.
