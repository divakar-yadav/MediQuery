The secondary aim is to study lung perfusion and cardiovascular function in these conditions.","detailedDescription":"Experiments were conducted in a human centrifuge. The protocol aimed at mimicking a routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and included 10-min exposure to +1.4 - +3.5 Gz. Subjects were exposed three times to this sequence, breathing air, 44.5% O2 or 100% O2.\n\nTen volunteers wearing anti-G trousers participated in the study. The Ethics Committee Ile-de-France III and the French National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) approved the protocol (number 2009-A01092-55).\n\nThree different imaging techniques, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), pulmonary ultrasound and chest SPECT/CT were used and compared. EIT enabled ventilation monitoring in the human centrifuge, whereas pulmonary ultrasound and SPECT/CT gave functional and topographical information before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations. EIT analysis focused on regional ventilation, SPECT on global lung ventilation and perfusion, CT on the presence of atelectasis, and pulmonary ultrasound analysis looked for comet tails in 64 chest areas. Arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously by finger photoplethysmography. Cardiac output and stroke volume were computed from these recordings, using three different algorithms. Echocardiography was used as reference non-invasive technique for stroke volume determination and performed before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atelectasis"],"keywords":["human centrifuge, oxygen, imaging, stroke volume, lung"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ventilation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"hypergravity gas mixture","interventionNames":["Other: hypergravity","Other: gas mixture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"hypergravity","description":"1hr sitting rest followed by 10 min of hypergravity (2 centrifuge runs)","armGroupLabels":["ventilation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"gas mixture","description":"breathing air, 44.5%O2 or 100%O2","armGroupLabels":["ventilation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in regional ventilation distribution","description":"\"per lobe and per quadrant at 5th intercostal space level\"","timeFrame":"baseline, 2hrs 30min"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change in regional pulmonary perfusion","description":"\"per lobe and per quadrant at 5th intercostal space level\"","timeFrame":"baseline, 2hrs 30min"},{"measure":"cardiac output (L/min)","description":"\"echocardiography (sub-aortic diameter), photoplethysmography (Liljestrand, systolic area and Windkessel algorithms)\"","timeFrame":"2hrs"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"tidal volume","description":"global (mL, area under the flow versus time curve) and regional (% change per quadrant at 5th intercostal space level)","timeFrame":"2hrs 30min"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* normal lung function checked by pulmonary function tests\n\nPart 1 exclusion Criteria:\n\n* past medical history of heart or lung disease\n* current medical treatment for heart or lung disease\n* smoking\n* bad tolerance to +Gz accelerations (G-induced loss of consciousness, motion sickness)\n\nPart 2 exclusion criteria:\n\n* past medical history of heart or lung disease\n* current medical treatment for heart or lung disease\n* smoking\n* The use of medication for hypertension\n* asymmetric values of left/right humeral arterial blood pressure\n* significant echocardiographic abnormalities or bad echogenicity\n* bad tolerance to +Gz accelerations (G-induced loss of consciousness, motion sickness)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Daniel Garin, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute","city":"Brétigny-sur-Orge","zip":"91 223","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.61135,"lon":2.30593}},{"facility":"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Val-de-Grâce hospital","city":"Paris","zip":"75005","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001261","term":"Pulmonary Atelectasis"},{"id":"D000018496","term":"Hyperoxia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000008171","term":"Lung Diseases"},{"id":"D000012140","term":"Respiratory Tract Diseases"},{"id":"D000012818","term":"Signs and Symptoms, Respiratory"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4257","name":"Pulmonary Atelectasis","asFound":"Atelectasis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20290","name":"Hyperoxia","asFound":"Hyperoxia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10858","name":"Lung Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14667","name":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15313","name":"Signs and Symptoms, Respiratory","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
