The distance from the incisors to the head part of the tube should be between 22-25 cm. However, the specific depth should be evaluated based on patients' feedback and adjusted accordingly. After insertion, the tail part of the tube should be put into a container full of water and the absence of continuous bubbles indicated a successful intubation.
