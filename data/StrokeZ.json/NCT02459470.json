Recently, stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV), dynamic preload indices derived from the arterial waveform are increasingly advocated as predictors of fluid responsiveness in anesthetized patients and critically ill patients. However, their usefulness in renal failure patients undergoing renal transplantation has not been investigated. Thus, the aims of this study is to investigate accuracy of SVV and PPV for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing kidney transplantation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Kidney Transplantation"],"keywords":["Fluid Responsiveness","Pulse Pressure Variation","Stroke Volume Variation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SVV and PPV","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SVV(stroke volume variation): recorded using the Flotrac/Vigileo system (Edwards Lifesciences)\n\nPPV(pulse pressure variation): recorded using philips Intelivue MP70 monitors (Philips Medical System)\n\nIntervention: Other: Fluid loading using HES 130/0.4; voluven; Fresenius Kabi; Stans, Switzerland","interventionNames":["Procedure: Fluid loading"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Fluid loading","description":"fluid loading was performed by using 7ml/kg of 6% hydroxyethyl starch within 10 min to all patients","armGroupLabels":["SVV and PPV"],"otherNames":["HES 130/0.4; voluven; Fresenius Kabi; Stans, Switzerland"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"stroke volume variation from Flo stroke volume variation from FloTrac/Vigileo system","description":"predictable of stroke volume variation from FloTrac/Vigileo system for fluid responsiveness","timeFrame":"within 5 minutes after fluid expansion"},{"measure":"pulse pressure variation from philips Intelivue MP70 monitor","description":"predictable of pulse pressure variation from philips Intelivue MP70 monitor for fluid responsiveness","timeFrame":"within 5 minutes after fluid expansion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- chronic renal failure patients undergoing renal transplantation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with cardiac arrhythmia\n* patients with reduced left ventricular function (EF \\< 40%)\n* patients with valvular heart disease\n* patients intracardiac shunt\n* patients with pulmonary hypertension\n* patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease\n* patients with preoperative use of vasopressors or inotropics","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gaab Soo Kim, M.D, Ph.D.","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain medicie, Samsung Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Samsung Seoul Hospital, Samsung Medical Center","city":"Seoul","zip":"135-710","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10389","name":"Kidney Failure, Chronic","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26408","name":"Renal Insufficiency","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
