In the effort to enhance outcomes of motor training, cortical priming using brain stimulation has emerged as a promising adjuvant to conventional rehabilitation. This project focuses on the development of a long term gait rehabilitation protocol using brain stimulation to improve walking outcomes in people with stroke. The project will also aim to understand the neural mechanisms that are associated with response to the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["tDCS","Walking"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Priming+HIISTT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and ankle motor training before high intensity interval speed based treadmill training","interventionNames":["Other: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","Other: Ankle motor training","Behavioral: High intensity interval speed based treadmill training (HIISTT)"]},{"label":"Sham+HIISTT","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham tDCS before high intensity interval speed based treadmill training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: High intensity interval speed based treadmill training (HIISTT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","description":"1 mA tDCS","armGroupLabels":["Priming+HIISTT"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ankle motor training","description":"Visuomotor target tracking task","armGroupLabels":["Priming+HIISTT"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"High intensity interval speed based treadmill training (HIISTT)","description":"Each treadmill session to include warm-up, high intensity speed-based intervals interleaved with active recovery, and cool down.","armGroupLabels":["Priming+HIISTT","Sham+HIISTT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking speed with 10 meter walk test","description":"Self-selected and fastest gait speed will be measured as the average of 3 trials of the 10-m walk test (10MWT).","timeFrame":"Change from baseline to immediately after training and baseline to 3 months follow up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking spatiotemporal characteristics with GAITRite walkway","description":"Spatiotemporal parameters of walking will be assessed using a 7m long pressure sensitive mat (GAITRite walkway).","timeFrame":"Change from baseline to immediately after training and baseline to 3 months follow up"},{"measure":"Motor impairment with Fugl Meyer Lower Extremity Scale","description":"Lower extremity impairment will be measured using the Fugl Meyer Lower Extremity Scale (FMLE), a series of tests of movement, reflex activity, coordination/speed, sensation, and range of motion.
