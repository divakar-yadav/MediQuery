Currently, mechanical thrombectomy can only be performed in stroke unit with an interventional neuroradiology center by experienced/qualified interventional neuroradiologists. In the Rhone area, only one hospital has the authorization to perform mechanical thrombectomy. Therefore, transferring directly eligible acute ischemic stroke patients for mechanical thrombectomy to this center constitutes an important stake of the triage of suspected acute ischemic stroke patients. Some validated scores for the identification of severe strokes and large vessel occlusion, including the Cincinnati prehospital stroke severity scale (CPSSS), appear to be relevant for pre-hospital use in order to identify patients potentially eligible for mechanical thrombectomy and address them to a stoke unit with interventional radiology center."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1272,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with suspected ischemic stroke","description":"The cohort will be constituted of patients treated for a stroke suspicion after calling emergency medical services of the Rhone and presenting a symptom-onset (the last time the patient was seen without deficit) less than 6 hours.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Questionnaire"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Questionnaire","description":"Tests from Cincinnati prehospital stroke severity scale (CPSSS) will be carried out by the physician at emergency medical services on telephone call with firemen, paramedics or the emergency medical services team for any stroke suspicion that meets the criteria for inclusion.
