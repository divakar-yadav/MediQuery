Findings from AIM 1 and 2 will provide novel evidence on the effects of backward gait training with exoskeleton in people with stroke and serve as a foundation for optimizing physical therapy protocols to improve motor functions and mental health. AIM 3 investigates the impact of social determinants of health and depression on patient adherence to physical therapy. Patient adherence (also called compliance) refers to the degree to which patients follow treatment recommendations prescribed by their health care provider.34 Even though patient adherence leads to positive treatment outcomes,35,36 it is affected by many factors, including patients' understanding of their disease and associated treatment (i.e., health literacy), social support, and depression.36-38 This experimental study employs a repeated measures design with participants randomly assigned to either a Standard Care with Ekso Group (SCG; control group, n=31) or a Standard Care with Ekso and Backward Walking Group (SCBWG; experimental group, n=31) in AIMs 1 and 2. AIMs 1 and 2 will be achieved using the group assignment as independent variables and motor function and depression as dependent variables. AIM 3 will be achieved using social determinants of health and depression as independent variables and patient adherence to physical therapy as an independent variable."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait, Hemiplegic","Physical Therapy"],"keywords":["Robotic exoskeleton","Backward gait training","Forward gait training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Care with Ekso Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in the SCG (n=31) will attend two 45-minute treatment sessions per week for a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 10 total sessions.
