A direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) for the endovascular treatment of stroke using a large-bore catheter has been reported to be an effective method of achieving MT. Recent studies reported that ADAPT is as efficient and safe as stent retrievers, with a similar successful recanalization rate, but may have better functional outcomes, fewer procedure related-adverse events, and a tendency for faster revascularization compared to the stent-retriever thrombectomy.\n\nHowever, navigation of a large-bore aspiration catheter is not always possible due to unsuccessful passage of the ophthalmic artery origin (\"ledge effect\") or tortuous vascular anatomy. The coaxial technique comprises guiding the large-bore catheter with a smaller inner catheter and can facilitate distal access. However, there is a gap between the inner catheter and the distal tip of the large-bore outer catheter that creates a risk of damaging the vessel wall and causing dissection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Even with this coaxial technique, it is not always possible to reach the clot site with the large-bore catheter. To decrease the gap between the two catheters, several authors have used, in place of the inner microcatheter, a compliant balloon catheter positioned and inflated at the distal tip of the large-bore catheter. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADAPT assisted by a compliant balloon (ADAPT-AB) when ADAPT using the coaxial technique fails to reach the clot site."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mechanical thrombectomy","description":"Patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation","interventionNames":["Device: Compliant balloon"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Compliant balloon","description":"Use of a compliant balloon when ADAPT fails to reach the clot site","armGroupLabels":["Mechanical thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacity to reach the clot site when using an inner balloon","description":"Number of patients for whom the balloon made it possible to reach the clot","timeFrame":"Day 0"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical status at 3 month","description":"Modified Rankin Score","timeFrame":"Month 3"},{"measure":"Endovascular Complication","description":"Number of dissection or vasospasm when using the balloon","timeFrame":"Day 0"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Endovascular therapy were large arterial occlusions proven by MR angiography,\n* Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) \\>5 on MRI,\n* Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score \\>5.\n\nIf eligible, patients received intravenous thrombolysis (IVT).\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n- Vertebro-basilar occlusion","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients who underwent an endovascular procedure for acute stroke in a single center from November 2018 to February 2020 were included in the study","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de NICE","city":"Nice","zip":"06000","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70313,"lon":7.26608}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
