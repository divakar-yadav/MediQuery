In order to safely manipulate the HR, the investigators will study patients with permanent pacemakers in whom heart rate manipulation can be done in a safe and non-invasive manner.","detailedDescription":"Permanent pacemakers have sometimes been used to treat patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. This is because patients with vasovagal syncope often experience bradycardia at the time of their syncope. Unfortunately, pacemakers are often ineffective in preventing syncope.\n\nClassical cardiovascular hemodynamics would suggest that increasing the heart rate (HR; via pacemaker) should increase the cardiac output (CO). This is because:\n\nCO = HR x Stroke volume (SV).\n\nThe assumption is that the SV is fixed during manipulation of the HR. However, this might not be the case. As the number of beats per minute (HR) increases, the cardiac cycle length (R-R interval \\[RRI\\]) shortens, as a function of simple math. This means that the time in cardiac systole shortens, and the time in cardiac diastole shortens. Since cardiac diastole is when the heart fills up with blood, faster HR can be associated with decreased cardiac filling times. This, in turn, could compromise the SV. However, there is a paucity of data as to what happens to SV and CO at different HR. Further, it is possible that these effects will be different when a person is lying down supine versus when a patient is upright (when stroke volume will be lower).\n\nThe investigators will seek to determine the effects of different HR on both SV \\& CO. In order to safely manipulate the HR, they will study patients with permanent pacemakers in whom HR manipulation can be done in a safe and non-invasive manner."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vasovagal Syncope"],"keywords":["pacemaker","stroke volume","cardiac output","heart rate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke volume and cardiac output","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pacing runs will occur at the following rates:\n\n* 50 beats per minute (bpm)\n* 60 bpm\n* 70 bpm\n* 80 bpm\n* 90 bpm\n* 100 bpm\n* 110 bpm\n* 120 bpm\n* 130 bpm\n\nThe finger blood pressure cuff will be calibrated between pacing runs.\n\nFollowing the final pacing run while supine, the patient will be given 10 minutes to rest prior to the upright portion of the study.
