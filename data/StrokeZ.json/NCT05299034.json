The specific objectives are:\n\n1. To confirm that the selection of patients for reperfusion therapies in the late window is safe by applying the same clinical and imaging criteria recommended by clinical guidelines for the early window treatment selection.\n2. To evaluate the performance of non-contrast CT by applying immediate post-processing software for the selection of patients for reperfusion treatment in the late window.\n3. To analyze the prehospital and arrival variables at the primary stroke center to generate decision trees that optimize the transfer decision in patients with activation of the stroke code in \\>6h from the onset of symptoms.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: Study based on a mandatory, prospective, multicenter registry (CICAT registry) consisting of two phases\n\n1. retrospective analysis with a detailed evaluation of the images of the included patients and generation of \"machine learning\" models that accurately predict the probability of receiving reperfusion treatment in the late window.\n2. validation of the models in a prospective study. Clinical, radiological and transport variables will be studied.\n\nResponse variables: rate of patients receiving reperfusion treatment in the late window, functional prognosis at 90 days, hemorrhagic transformation, and mortality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2173,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients 6-24h receiving non-contrast CT + CTA","description":"Stroke patients 6-24h undergoing non-contrast CT + CTA to decide stroke therapy","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Non contrast CT+CT angiography"]},{"label":"Stroke patients 6-24h receiving multimodal imaging","description":"Stroke patients 6-24h undergoing NCCT+CTA+CTP or MRI with DWI and PWI imaging to decide stroke therapy","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Multiparametric imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Multiparametric imaging","description":"MR perfusion or multiparametric CT including NCCT, CTA and CTP","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients 6-24h receiving multimodal imaging"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Non contrast CT+CT angiography","description":"NCCT+CTA","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients 6-24h receiving non-contrast CT + CTA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS at 90 days","description":"Percentage of patients with functional independence, defined as mRS \\< or =2 on day 90 as assessed centrally by blinded evaluators of the Catalan Stroke Master Plan.","timeFrame":"90 days after stroke"},{"measure":"Rate of patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy","timeFrame":"less than 24 hours after the diagnostic test"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality at discharge and at day 90","timeFrame":"90 days after stroke"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, defined as PH2 or SAH on imaging test at 24-72 hours associated with a worsening in NIHSS ≥ 4 points","timeFrame":"From 24 to 72 hours after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* SUBSTUDY 1.
