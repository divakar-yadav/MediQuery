It is to investigate whether patients with a higher burden of cerebral haemodynamic insults have an increased incidence or poorer neurological outcomes. Associations between neurologic outcomes, neurobiomarkers and genetic tests will be explored.","detailedDescription":"Adverse neurological events include perioperative neurocognitive disorders and stroke and remain one of the major risks after cardiac surgery. A lack of a comprehensive knowledge of their causes and neuroprotective strategies has hindered the development of strategies to effectively reduce these complications. Against this background, this research project will take three approaches. First, non-invasive, personalised cerebral autoregulation-oriented blood pressure monitoring aims to reduce complications by uncovering blood pressure targets tailored to individual characteristics. In parallel, establishing biological associations between adverse neurological outcomes, brain injury biomarkers and genetic studies are complementary strategies that make a move to a proactive patient-tailored paradigm, ultimately understanding the mechanisms and improving patient outcomes, patient safety and quality of life.\n\nTherefore, this international, multicentre prospective cohort study will assess whether perioperative duration and magnitude of MAP outside of an individual's CA limits using NIRS and TCD are associated with adverse neurological events. It is to investigate whether patients with a higher burden of cerebral haemodynamic insults, defined by the duration and magnitude spent outside of an individual's CA limits based on NIRS and/or TCD, have an increased incidence of postoperative delirium (POD), stroke or cognitive decline. Biological associations between adverse neurological outcomes, the role of brain injury serum biomarkers will be explored. Genetic studies will be conducted on participants who give written informed consent for these further investigations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Postoperative Delirium","Postoperative Stroke","Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction"],"keywords":["cerebral autoregulation","hypotension","neurological outcomes","adverse neurological events","postoperative delirium","postoperative stroke","postoperative cognitive decline","personalised cardiac anaesthesia","cardiac surgery","near-infrared spectroscopy","transcranial Doppler"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"The remaining biological materials (non-genetic and genetic) will be stored in biobanks in accordance with local technical and legal standards for 10 years after publication of this study for future research projects that have not yet been defined in more detail and for which a ethical approval will be attained."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Preoperative data collection","description":"Preoperatively, patients will be assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Clinical Frailty Scale, 3-minute Diagnostic interview for Confusion Assessment Method-defined delirium (3D-CAM, incl. severity score), modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS), and hand grip strength measurement (using a hand dynamometer) to establish a baseline measurement of the physical, cognitive and mental status."},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Intraoperative NIRS","description":"Intraoperatively, NIRS data will be collected and recorded in real-time."},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Intraoperative TCD","description":"Intraoperatively, TCD data will be collected and recorded in real-time."},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Intraoperative invasive MAP","description":"Intraoperatively, invasive arterial blood pressure data will be collected and recorded in real-time."},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Postoperative NIRS","description":"Postoperatively, NIRS monitoring will be continued in the ICU after the surgery until (i) endotracheal extubation, or (ii) for the first 24 hours or (iii) until emergency re-operation, whichever occurs first."},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Postoperative data collection","description":"Postoperatively patients will be evaluated for POD with 3D-CAM or CAM-ICU and for clinical stroke with mNIHSS.
