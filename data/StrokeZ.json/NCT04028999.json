Pain associated with UL impairment due to multifactorial causes is a frequent symptom in patients with stroke. Occupational therapy techniques focus on the implementation of positioning techniques and the use of supportive devices (SD) such as slings aimed to prevent pain; therefore increase daily function, participation and hence quality of life. At present, positioning principles of the hemiplegic shoulder exist in clinical practice. These are aimed at prevention of pain associated with UL Impairment; however there is no clear consensus among professionals of particular SD that should be implemented for adults with stroke"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Accident","sling","Upper limb impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"the EO31 shoulder sling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To develop and evaluate the effects of the EO31 shoulder sling for the prevention of pain, subluxation, spasticity, as well as effect on increasing functional use of the UL in activities of daily living.","interventionNames":["Device: Evaluate the effects of the EO31 shoulder sling in adults post-stoke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Evaluate the effects of the EO31 shoulder sling in adults post-stoke","description":"Investigator want to evaluate the efficient of the EO31 shoulder sling in adults post-stroke.
