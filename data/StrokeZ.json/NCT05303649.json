Despite natural tendency to spontaneous functional recovery in the first months post stroke and language improvement due to application of behavioral speech and language therapy (SLT), many aphasic patients do not achieve satisfactory level of verbal communication. The aim of the planned study is to explore the potential of the noninvasive repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a therapeutic tool for aphasia in addition to traditional behavioral therapy. In case of aphasia, studies on therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS aim to increase the activity of the language-dominant left cerebral hemisphere, which may be achieved in an indirect manner by inhibiting the activity of the opposite (right) hemisphere or in a direct manner by increasing the excitability of preserved language areas in the left hemisphere. In our study, we plan to administer the newest form of rTMS called Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), which is safer than the conventional rTMS, even when used in the perilesional area. Computer-based neuronavigation system will be implemented to precisely localize stimulation targets, control administration of stimuli during rTMS sessions, and evaluate differences between participants regarding deviations from established stimulation points. 45 patients (all right-handed, polish native speakers, aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with non-fluent aphasia) will be enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: 1) a group with excitatory intermittent TBS of the left hemisphere (iTBS group), 2) a group with inhibitory continuous TBS of the right hemisphere (cTBS group), 3) a group with sham TBS (sTBS group as a control group). Specific forms of stimulation will be carried out for three consecutive weeks (Monday to Friday; a total of 15 stimulation sessions). Immediately after each session of the stimulation, patients will undergo individual SLT. Assessment of language functioning will be carried out three times: before and after the therapy period, and 3 months after its completion. Results of the study will broaden knowledge about hemispherical mechanisms of language and speech recovery after stroke and provide insight into possibilities of their modulation for the purpose of post-stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Aphasia Non Fluent"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Stroke","Theta Burst Stimulation","Therapy","Rehabilitation","Noninvasive Transcranial Brain Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intermittent TBS (iTBS) of the left hemisphere plus behavioral aphasia therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 sessions of 200-second of iTBS over the pars triangularis of Broca's area in the left hemisphere (BA 45), preceding 45-minutes of behavioral aphasia therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation: excitatory iTBS","Behavioral: Individual speech-language therapy (SLT)"]},{"label":"Continuous TBS (cTBS) of the right hemisphere plus behavioral aphasia therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 sessions of 40 seconds of cTBS over the pars triangularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45 homologue), preceding 45-minutes of behavioral aphasia therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation: inhibitory cTBS","Behavioral: Individual speech-language therapy (SLT)"]},{"label":"Sham TBS (sTBS) of the left hemisphere plus behavioral aphasia therapy","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"15 sessions of sham TBS over the pars triangularis of Broca's area in the left hemisphere (BA 45), preceding 45-minutes of behavioral aphasia therapy.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Individual speech-language therapy (SLT)","Device: Sham TBS simulating left hemispheric iTBS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation: excitatory iTBS","description":"600 pulses (3 pulses at 50 Hz given every 200 milliseconds in 2-second trains at 10-second intervals, delivered at 80% of active motor threshold) generated by Magstim Super Rapid2 stimulator equipped with a figure-of-eight coil applied over BA 45 Device: Magstim Co., Wales, UK.","armGroupLabels":["Intermittent TBS (iTBS) of the left hemisphere plus behavioral aphasia therapy"],"otherNames":["Magstim Super Rapid2"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation: inhibitory cTBS","description":"600 pulses (3 pulses at 50 Hz, repeated at 5 Hz, delivered at 80% of active motor threshold) generated by Magstim Super Rapid2 stimulator equipped with a figure-of-eight coil applied over BA 45 homologue Device: Magstim Co., Wales, UK.","armGroupLabels":["Continuous TBS (cTBS) of the right hemisphere plus behavioral aphasia therapy"],"otherNames":["Magstim Super Rapid2"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Individual speech-language therapy (SLT)","description":"45 minutes training tailored to every patient's deficits, abilities and needs.
