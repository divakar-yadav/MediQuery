The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Whether favourate taste stimulation of oral and tounge is better than traditional thermal stimulation in improving swallowing function of patients with dysphagia.\n2. It has been reported that taste of sour stimulation can increase the frequency of swallowing. In this study, we want to know which is better for improving swallowing function between favourate taste stimulation and sour taste stimulation.\n3. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be applied in this study to understand the neural mechanism of taste stimulation in improving swallowing function.\n\nParticipants screened as post-stroke dysphagia will accept swallowing evaluation and fNIRS test before and after treatment. The treatment include taste stimulation and traditional swallowing training.\n\nResearchers will compare favourate taste stimulation with sour-taste stimulation and single thermal stimulation to see if the swallowing function improved faster and better in favourate taste stimulation group.","detailedDescription":"Taste perception can help to initiate swallow. Different taste has different impact on swallowing function. Patients with post-stroke dysphagia always have taste impairment and initiation delay of swallowing. In this study, patients with dysphagia after stroke will be recruited and treated with favourate taste stimulation or sour taste stimulation or non-taste stimulation for 2 weeks. Traditional swallowing rehabilitation will be applied base on the status of patients. Before and after the treatment, participants completed swallowing assessment, including quantitative measurement of hyoid displacement, functional oral intake scale (FOIS), dysphagia severity rating scale (DSRS), and standardized swallowing assessment (SSA). In order to understand the effect of taste stimulation on brain network, fNIRS will be conducted.The participants have to conduct these examination three to four weeks after the treatment to undertand the long-time effect of taste stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["taste stimulation","sour stimulaiton","thermal stimulation","functional near-inrared spectroscopy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Favourate taste stimulation group, sour stimulation group and thermal stimulation group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":87,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Favourate taste stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The swab will be immersed in sugar, salt, citric acid, or paprika mixed with water, and be placed in -18℃ refrigerator.
