Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to orally receive MLC1501 low-dose twice a day, MLC1501 high-dose twice a day, or matching placebo for 24 weeks.","detailedDescription":"A total of 540 patients will be included with approximately 180 participants randomized to each treatment arm. Randomization will be performed centrally and stratified according to the following factors at the time of randomization: NIHSS (8 to 12, 13 to 18), age (\\<65 years, â‰¥65 years) and received either intravenous or endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy (no, yes).\n\nEfficacy clinical assessments will include mRS, FMA, ARAT, 10MWT, NIHSS, Barthel Index, EQ-5D-5L, MoCA, PROMIS-10, and occurrence of recurrent vascular event.\n\nEach participant will undergo standard safety assessments including physical exam and laboratory parameters, and be observed for adverse events for the duration of the study. Electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at specified intervals. The C-SSRS will be used to screen for suicidal ideation and behavior. Blood samples will be collected and stored for future studies on circulating compounds and pharmacokinetics."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Strokes Thrombotic","Stroke Sequelae","Stroke, Cardiovascular","Stroke, Embolic","Stroke, Cryptogenic"],"keywords":["stroke","MLC1501","MAEStro","stroke recovery","neurorestoration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":540,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"500-mg placebo capsule, 4 capsules twice a day for 24 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"MLC1501 Low-dose","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"MLC1501 low-dose 500-mg capsule, 4 capsules twice a day for 24 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: MLC1501"]},{"label":"MLC1501 High-dose","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"MLC1501 high-dose 500-mg capsule, 4 capsules twice a day for 24 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: MLC1501"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"MLC1501","description":"Powdered extract of Radix astragali, Rhizoma chuanxiong, Radix angelica sinensis, Radix polygala","armGroupLabels":["MLC1501 High-dose","MLC1501 Low-dose"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Caramel, chocolate brown, flavor (E_1982648), dextrin","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale","description":"The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 5 (severe disability).
