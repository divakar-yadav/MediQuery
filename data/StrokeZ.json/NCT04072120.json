We will also model and map spatial variation in stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality and see if some of the variation is due to spatial clustering of familial risk. The study will use innovative approaches to large-scale registry and survey data and statistical analysis on the full Norwegian population. We will integrate multigenerational and geographical information. This will enable us to assess key determinants on stroke survival and use of health and social care at municipality level."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Post-acute stroke","Geographical proximity","Family","Relatives","Survival analysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7400000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"R1","description":"1.
