This study will rely heavily on its descriptive section, which will use in-depth, open-ended questions in a semi-structured personal interview format following qualitative research principles. It will also use closed-ended questions in a short survey format to begin to explore some variables that may be associated with using traditional healing practices. These variables include level of acculturation, degree of family social support, degree of adherence to standard medical regimens, perceived health status, presence of depressive symptoms, and severity of co-illnesses. These variables will be examined using common, validated scales."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Hypertension","Asthma","Heart Disease","Stroke","Arthritis"],"keywords":["Latino patients","Health practices","Culture influences"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","description":"Participants will be self-identified, adult Latino men and women from the community setting.
