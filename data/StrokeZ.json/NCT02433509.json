StemCyte, a leading accredited UCB banking company with branches in the United States and Taiwan, will provide the units of UCB that match at least 4 out of 6 HLA (human leukocyte antigens) for transplantation. The HLA-matching is the same as that used to match cells and organs for transplantation so that the body does not reject the cells.
