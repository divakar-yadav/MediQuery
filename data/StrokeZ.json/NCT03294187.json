It often leads to a hemiparesis. Intensive stroke rehabilitation speeds up recovery. In daily practice, the financial and/or human resources to provide this intensive rehabilitation are often lacking. Applying modern-day tracking and feedback technology to encourage a self-administered, context specific training is expected to offer significant potential to increase intensity of practice. Up until now, there has been no randomized trial examining the effect of such an intervention on daily arm usage.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of wearing an activity tracking and multimodal feedback device for six weeks on self-reported daily life use of the paretic arm after stroke, when compared to control group stroke subjects wearing a hardware-wise identical sham device providing no feedback. The secondary aim is to examine compliance to use the device and the quantitative, qualitative and functional improvement of the paretic arm. It is hypothesized that participants in the experimental group show a higher change in self-reported daily life use of the paretic arm when compared to the control group both post intervention and at 6-week follow-up.\n\nISEAR is a multicenter, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial of 62 subjects beyond the first 3 months poststroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper Extremity","Feedback","Rehabilitation","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Monitoring and Feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will use two wrist-worn wearables over a period of 6 weeks.
