It is hypothesized that anodal tDCS on the lesion side and/or cathodal tDCS on the healthy side of motor cortex could improve the recovery of motor function such as learning.","detailedDescription":"We aim to apply transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to study the recovery process of motor learning on the patients with brain damage caused by traumatic brain injury or stroke. Both anodal and cathodal tDCS will be used to test whether the increase of motor cortical activity by anodal tDCS over lesional side or the decrease of brain activity by cathodal tDCS on healthy side will improve the learning skill (SRTT: serial reaction time task). The result could help to understand the mechanism of motor and cognitive recovery after brain damage, and further rationalize the application of non-invasive brain stimulation such as tDCS for patient rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"non-invasive brain stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","description":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","armGroupLabels":["non-invasive brain stimulation"],"otherNames":["Chanttanooga ionto Dual Channel Stimulator"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reaction time (millisecond)","description":"Primary outcome measure is the average reaction time of 360 trials from each block -- the task is composed of 8 blocks.
