Hemorrhagic stroke will induce secondary peri-blood clot edema and that may increase intracranial pressure to exacerbate clinical symptom. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of AM on hemorrhagic stroke edema. The investigators selected 80 hemorrhagic stroke patients , and who the stroke is first attack, they were randomly divided into control and experimental groups, and each group was 40 patients as follows: 1) control group, accepted AM placebo 2.8 g three times per day (tid) treatment for continuously 14 days from second day of admission or operation, except standard ordinary treatment; 2) experimental group, accepted AM 2.8 g tid treatment for continuously 14 days from second day of admission or operation, except standard ordinary treatment. Computer tomography (CT) examination was done at first day, 4th day and 7th day of admission, respectively. The ratio of brain edema was calculated by CT image, and inflammatory index including the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)，Creatine Kinase BB Isoenzyme (CMBB). D-dimer from venous blood also were measured. In addition, the score including Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), Modified rankin scale (MRS), Function independence measure (FIM), Barthel index (BI) was recorded one week, four weeks and 12 weeks after admission or surgical operation, as an index for clinical symptoms. The index for the therapeutic effect of AM was according to above-mentioned the ratio of brain edema, inflammatory index and clinical symptoms.\n\nThe investigators expected the results of the present study may provide a scientific evidence for the hemorrhagic stroke edema treatment of AM, thus, the present study may contribute to use the method of integrated Chinese and Western Medicine for the treatment of stroke, and to the research of Chinese Medicine."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemorrhagic Transformation Due to Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Complementary therapies","Acute hemorrhagic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Chinese Herb Astragalus membranaceus"]},{"label":"Arm B","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chinese Herb Astragalus membranaceus","description":"Astragalus membranaceus ( AM) at a rate of 3 g three times per day","armGroupLabels":["Arm A"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"at a rate of 3 g three times per day","armGroupLabels":["Arm B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"patients' scores(BI,FIM,GOS,mRS) on several clinical scales","description":"The primary outcome measures were the differences in patients' scores on several clinical scales, between baseline (within 7 ± 1 days after the onset of stroke) and week 4 (28 ± 4 days), and between at baseline and week 12 (84 ± 10 days).
