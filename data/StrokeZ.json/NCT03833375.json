Decision aids (DAs) are shared decision-making tools which have been successfully implemented and validated for many other diseases to assist difficult decision making. The investigators have developed a pilot DA for goals-of-care decisions for surrogates of SABI patients.

The investigators now propose to pilot-test a DA for surrogates of SABI patients in a feasibility trial.","detailedDescription":"Severe acute brain injury (SABI), including large artery acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and severe traumatic brain injury continue to be the leading cause of death and disability in adults in the U.S, accounting for more than 200,000 of the acute brain injury-related deaths in the U.S. annually. Patients with SABI are critically ill and most commonly require mechanical ventilation and supportive medical care with artificial nutrition to ensure survival. However, due to concerns for a poor long-term quality of life, withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and supportive medical care with transition to comfort care is by far the most common cause of death in SABI but occurs at a highly variable rate (for example in TBI 45-90%) at different trauma centers. Shared decision making is a collaborative process that enhances patients' and surrogates' understanding about prognosis, encourages them to actively weigh the risks and benefits of a treatment, and to match them to patient preferences, thereby decreasing decisional conflict and improving decision quality and health related outcomes. Decision aids (DAs) are shared decision-making tools which have been successfully implemented and validated for many other diseases to assist difficult decision making. No DA currently exists for goals-of-care decisions in SABI. Such a patient- and family-centered DA has the potential to improve decision-making for SABI patients by ensuring proxies receive consistent, evidence-based prognostication while also addressing patients' preferences and values. The investigators have developed a pilot DA for goals of care decisions by surrogates of SABI patients using qualitative research using semi-structured interviews in surrogate decision makers of TBI patients and physicians, followed by an iterative feedback process with feedback by surrogates, physicians, and other stakeholders (ICU nurses). The investigators now propose to pilot-test a DA for surrogates of SABI patients in a feasibility trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Ischemic Stroke","Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["TBI","stroke","ICH","AIS","decision aid","shared decision making","neurocritical care","SABI","surrogate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Open-label, usual-care-controlled feasibility trial comparing decision aid intervention prior to the goals-of-care family meeting to standard of care (no intervention prior to family meeting).","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual Care (n=20)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Control: general information about TBI from Center for Disease Control (CDC)/about stroke/Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) from American Heart/Stroke Association"},{"label":"Decision Aid (n=20)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Paper Decision aid (share decision making tool) with worksheet for surrogates","interventionNames":["Other: Decision Aid"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Decision Aid","description":"Shared-decision making tool","armGroupLabels":["Decision Aid (n=20)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recruitment","description":"Consent rate","timeFrame":"From date of approaching surrogate decision maker for consent until the date of the first documented goals-of-care family meeting, assessed up to 1 month after admission."},{"measure":"Participation","description":"Proportion of participants who read decision aid and completed worksheet","timeFrame":"1-36 hours after family meeting"},{"measure":"Retention","description":"Number of participants who complete follow-up","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinician-surrogate concordance scale score","description":"measures prognostic concordance between ICU clinicians and surrogates.
