The socio - economic hardship that many patients face to perform a program of intensive rehabilitation sensorimotor, has led to functional limitations in many cases , promote irreversible consequences. Spasticity in the upper and lower limb after stroke results in loss of function and mobility being the key therapeutic approaches in order to restore its function. Currently, the Virtual therapy has been used in physical therapy, demonstrating safety, feasibility and potential to facilitate the effective rehabilitation treatment, promoting motor recovery. The objective of this study is to analyze and compare the effectiveness of virtual therapy and conventional physiotherapy in paretic upper and lower limbs of patients with sensory motor deficit after stroke. Virtual therapy will be based on a custom application using virtual reality projection, and conventional treatment will be based on cinesiotherapy for members upper and lower paretic. The evaluation will be performed by biomedical instrumentation using dynamometry, electromyography and analysis from functional movement. Statistical differences are based on t test with significance level of p 0 , 05 . As a result expected - scientifically proven the effectiveness of this new form of treatment aimed at improving quality of life and functional independence of patients with neurological sequel."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","spasticity","physiotherapy","virtual reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"virtual therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group 1 (G1) included 20 patients who will carry out the virtual therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: virtual therapy"]},{"label":"conventional physiotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group 2 (G2) included 20 patients who hold conventional physiotherapy.","interventionNames":["Other: conventional physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"virtual therapy","armGroupLabels":["virtual therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional physiotherapy","armGroupLabels":["conventional physiotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Espasticity","description":"It is believed that this study achieves positive results regarding the adequacy of muscle tone associated with musculoskeletal better performance, so that the muscles normotônicos gain strength and overcome the resistance of the hypertonic muscles, improving range of motion and harmony of the affected limbs, leading the consequent improvement of balance and gait, after application of virtual therapy.","timeFrame":"4 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Medical referral for physiotherapy;\n* Maximum grade 2 spasticity in the upper and lower limbs according to the Modified Ashworth Scale;\n* Total passive range of elbow joint and knee to the movement of flexion and extension;\n* Independent ambulation, with or without support;\n* Cognitive preserved, being able to respond to the command of the examiner;\n* Least 6 months of injury;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active infection, and rash at the site of application of NMES;\n* Visual and hearing impairment;\n* Joint stiffness and musculoskeletal injuries of the elbow and knee,\n* Inability to interpret the therapeutic resources to be displayed;\n* Presenting lesions in areas of Wernick and drill;\n* Uncontrolled hypertension.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ana Carolina Borges, masters students","role":"CONTACT","phone":"5512981014448","email":"carolborges.fisio@gmail.com"},{"name":"Mário Oliveira Lima, professor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"551239471000","phoneExt":"2066","email":"mol@univap.br"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Lersm, Ip&D","status":"RECRUITING","city":"São José dos Campos","state":"São Paulo","zip":"12244-000","country":"Brazil","contacts":[{"name":"Ana Carolina Borges, masters students","role":"CONTACT","phone":"5512981014448","email":"carolborges.fisio@gmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-23.17944,"lon":-45.88694}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
