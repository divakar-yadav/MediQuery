An intervention that integrates clinical pharmacists, a pharmacy technician, and follows a checklist published by experts at the Anticoagulation Forum can prevent adverse outcomes. The Investigators propose research on the effectiveness, implementation, and dissemination for a care transition intervention that follows the checklist which includes evaluation for appropriateness of DOAC use, assistance with drug procurement, telephone access to an anticoagulation expert, and other best practice recommendations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Venous Thromboembolism","Atrial Fibrillation","Bleeding","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":561,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"},{"label":"Clinical Pharmacist Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical Pharmacist Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical Pharmacist Intervention","description":"After randomization, the pharmacist calls patients to assess drug choice and dose.
