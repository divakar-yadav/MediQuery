Our findings have been supported by other research that have shown that rising from sitting is a maneuver that has been advocated for strengthening the lower extremities of elderly individuals and patients with specific disorders such as stroke. During the acute care and rehabilitation phases, considerable effort is spent to maximize a person's functional abilities following a stroke; however, continued strengthening and activity appears to stop once an individual is admitted to a LTC facility.\n\nThe main purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of implementing the Sit-to-Stand (STS) protocol with or without extra sit-to-stand practice for survivors of stroke residing in Long-Term Care (LTC) facilities on (1) their ability to learn how to stand safely and independently from a 16\" surface; (2) the number of staff injuries; (3) the number of residents' falls; (4) the quality of life of the residents and staff; and (5) the translation and maintenance of knowledge of the STS protocol by staff into their daily routines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Long-Term Care","Clinical Protocols","Sit-To-Stand"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sit-To-Stand Protocol and Extra Practice in Sit-To-Stand"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ability to independently perform Sit-To-Stand at 12 weeks and 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Score on quality of life measure (COOP) at 12 and 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Score on stroke assessment (CMSA) at 12 and 24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of resident falls at 12 and 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of staff injuries at 12 and 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Knowledge of staff on STS protocol immediately post-training, 12 and 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Score on quality of life measure (SF-20) at 12 and 24 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident\n* Reside in Long-Term Care Facility\n* Have physician approval to participate in the study\n* Are unable to stand up independently from a 16\" surface without using their hands\n* Have given informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Expect to be leaving the facility in less than 24 weeks\n* Have a terminal illness\n* Have a total hip replacement or other orthopedic complication that prevents them from being able to safely use protocol\n* Have pain that prevents their participation\n* Are at higher risk for falling (i.e. blood pressure disorder/postural hypotension, vestibular disorder)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Susan R Barreca, PT, BA","affiliation":"Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hamilton Health Sciences, Chedoke Site","city":"Hamilton","state":"Ontario","zip":"L8N 3Z5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.25011,"lon":-79.84963}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
