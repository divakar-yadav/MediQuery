Heart failure at its early stage is often silent. At present, primary prevention for heart failure is not available. Our aim is to identify diabetic patients at risk of heart failure in order to develop personalized preventive strategies.\n\nType 2 diabetes is vascular and metabolic risk factor for cognitive decline though a direct lesional effect but also through an interaction with underlying neurodegenerative lesions.
