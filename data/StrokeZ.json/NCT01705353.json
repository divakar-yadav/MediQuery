The acute pathophysiology of stroke depends on the innate immune response, which arises from mostly pro-inflammatory cascades. The chronic pathophysiology of stroke is less clear as the innate inflammatory response fades and matures into an adaptive immune response. HMGB-1 is a serum cytokine that has been found with persistent elevated levels for weeks to months after neurological insult in preclinical experiments, and may retard functional recovery. Elucidation of the relationship between HMGB-1 levels and the rate of functional recovery after stroke could lead to a better understanding of the systemic inflammatory response and more targeted therapeutic interventions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebral Stroke","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","HMGB-1","cytokines","functional recovery","inflammation","immune response"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Whole blood, DNA, serum/serum cytokines"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cytokine levels (HMGB-1) in plasma samples","timeFrame":"day 1, day7, day 14, day 30, day 90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIH and Rankin Clinical Measures of functional recovery","timeFrame":"day 1, day7, day 14, day 30, day 90"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients admitted to the stroke service at Northshore and LIJ Medical Centers\n* Patients 18 years of age or older\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients \\< 18 years of age","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute care hospital (stroke unit)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bruce T Volpe, MD","affiliation":"Feinstein Institute for Medical Research","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"North Shore University Hospital","city":"Manhasset","state":"New York","zip":"11030","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.79788,"lon":-73.69957}},{"facility":"Long Island Jewish Medical Center","city":"New Hyde Park","state":"New York","zip":"11040","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.7351,"lon":-73.68791}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19005067","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Muhammad S, Barakat W, Stoyanov S, Murikinati S, Yang H, Tracey KJ, Bendszus M, Rossetti G, Nawroth PP, Bierhaus A, Schwaninger M.
