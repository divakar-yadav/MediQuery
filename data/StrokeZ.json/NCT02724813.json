However, a decreasing proportion of stroke patients are able to access or receive publicly funded rehabilitation. The investigators have shown in previous studies that in-person delivery of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) rehabilitation approach to promoting attainment of everyday life goals has resulted in improvements in functional independence and executive function. In a small pilot study of tele-CO-OP with people with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n=3), the investigators found the delivery method was feasible and that participants were satisfied with the treatment and demonstrated clinically significant improvements on personally meaningful activities. The investigators will investigate the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of delivering CO-OP in an online format to reduce disability post-stroke. The study design is a single-blind (assessor), randomized wait-list control trial with a one-month retention follow-up. All therapy and testing sessions will be delivered online. We hypothesize that participants will demonstrate improvement in everyday activities and community participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 16 one-hour tele-CO-OP sessions delivered over a 10-week period by a licensed health care professional.
