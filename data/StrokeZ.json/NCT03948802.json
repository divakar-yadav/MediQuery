Blood is collected on the first and seventh days of stroke.\n\nThe purpose is to clarify utility of IL 33 as a biomarker of acute stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the third most frequent cause of death in highly developed countries (after heart disease and cancer), the main cause of disability in adults and the second most frequent cause of dementia syndromes. The annual incidence of stroke in the general population is approximately 0.2%. The risk of stroke increases with age.\n\nGlobally 15 million people are affected each year and 5.5 million die every year for this reason (20% in 30 days and up to 40% in a year from getting ill). In Poland, the incidence of stroke is around 175/100,000 in men and 125/100 in women.It is assumed that the cause of sudden cerebral insufficiency is mainly the embolism coming from the newly formed wall clot forming at the site of the atherosclerotic plaque rupture.\n\nIn recent years, the role of inflammatory factors is associated with the occurrence of severe atherosclerotic complications such as stroke or heart attack. Cytokines are glycoproteins that are released by activated cells of various tissues. They have a significant impact on the inflammation processes, they control all phases of the immune response. Interleukin is one of the cytokine groups. This study aims to find a relationship between level of IL 33 concentration and the size of the stroke and neurological deficit.\n\nBlood will be collected on the first and seventh days of stroke for examination of Il 33, blood morphology and hsCRP"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Interleukin 33","ASTRAL","DRAGON","NIHSS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"For the examination a venous blood is taken up from the elbow vein - 10 ml into the test tube containing 3.2 % solution of sodium citrate, for routine examinations (including the morphology with the smear, hsCRP).

DRAGON scale was developed to make early predictions about clinical outcomes for ischemic stroke patients using only information that is available shortly after they arrive at the hospital and before tPA is given. The DRAGON score, especially at the low and high end of the scale, can help predict which patients are likely to have good clinical outcomes and those who are likely to have miserable clinical outcomes even if given tPA.
