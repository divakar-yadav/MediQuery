It is not clear, if cognitive impairments after stroke is caused by the mg-deficiency or by the stroke itself. Until now, no studies investigating the relationship between mg-concentration, stroke severity and cognition during treatment course are available. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between mg-concentration and cognition of stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Stroke patients admitted to the stroke unit will be included. Initial mg-concentration in serum as well as stroke related measures (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Scandinavian Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale) will be ealuated. Moreover, the cognitive abilities of the patient will be assessed within the first three days via the Kölner Neuropsychologische Screening for stroke patients as well as the Mini Mental Status Test.\n\nDuring stroke rehabilitation mg-level, stroke related measures (NIHSS,SSS,MRS) as well as the cognitive tests (MMST,KöpSS) will be re-assed after 4 weeks, 3 month as well as at study end, which is defined as discharge from the clinic (death, transfer to another hospital without return after 4 weeks, discharge to long-term nursing/ home/hospice).\n\nAttention-network of stroke patients are measeared if the patient undergo a MRi scan.\n\nIn this study following questions will be assessed:\n\n1. What is the incidence of cognitive impairments in stroke patients?\n\n   1. Are there differences between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients?\n   2. Are there age and/or gender differences?\n2. Are there differences regarding the mg-concentration at admission in comparison to the follow-up (week 4 after admission, 3 month after admission) and between patients with/without cognitive impairments?\n3. Is there a correlation between the mg-concentration and the stroke severity?\n4. Is there a correlation between the scores of the different cognitive tests (MMST and KöpSS)?\n5. Is there an association between the stroke severity, the cognitive impairments (KöpSS) and the neuronal attention network?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognition","Magnesium","Neurologic Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Patients","description":"Ischemic-/hemorragic stroke patients, who admitted on the stroke unit.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Kölner Neuropsychologische Screening für Schlaganfall-Patienten"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Kölner Neuropsychologische Screening für Schlaganfall-Patienten","description":"The cognitive state of the patient is measure by the Kölner Neuropsychologische Screening (KöpSS) and by the Mini Mental Status Test (MMST).
