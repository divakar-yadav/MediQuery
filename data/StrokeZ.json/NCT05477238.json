The investigators recommend post-stroke patients to practice physical activity. Nevertheless, the recommendations are not widely respected due to the intensity of exercises. Oxygen consumption is a parameter to assess the intensity of physical activity. in this sense, we want to measure the oxygen consumption during various walking tasks compared to healthy controls.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is defined as an interruption of blood circulation in the brain. The treatments are in first time medical in emergency. Then, the patient will start his rehabilitation with several contributors. At this time, it will recommend physical activity to patients. Regardless of the all benefits of physical activity, it will help patient to avoid a second stroke. The investigators have the recommendations of the high authority of health in physical activity for stroke population. It recommends to practice around 20 to 60 minutes daily of physical activity with moderate effort intensity. Oxygen consumption is a parameter of effort intensity of physical activity measured in ml O2/kg/min. Currently, the investigators have the compendium of physical activity (PA). it allows us to classify PA according to effort intensity. And so, an activity with a moderate effort intensity is an activity between 3 and 5.9 metabolic equivalent task (MET). Note that 1 MET is 3.5 ml/O2/Kg. Nevertheless, this compendium does not correspond to post-stroke individuals. As consequences, Low intensity exercise as described in guidelines might be at a moderate intensity level for stroke survivors. Hence, the investigators want to assess the oxygen consumption of post-stroke individuals during various walking tasks and compare it to healthy controls."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke","Oxygen consumption","physical activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Monocentric, cross-sectional and comparative study","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cerebrovascular Accident","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke patients will perform 2 walking tests indoors and outdoors wearing a gas exchange analyzer, an accelerometer and a heart rate monitor meter","interventionNames":["Procedure: walking tasks"]},{"label":"healthy volunteer","type":"OTHER","description":"Healthy volunteers patients will perform 2 walking tests indoors and outdoors wearing a gas exchange analyzer, an accelerometer and a heart rate monitor meter","interventionNames":["Procedure: walking tasks"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"walking tasks","description":"The experiment will be divided in two sessions.
