The pilot phase will explore the feasibility of conducting a trial of starting antiplatelet monotherapy versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy for reducing all serious vascular events for adults surviving symptomatic stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). The pilot phase will involve \\~120 patients at \\~30 hospitals in China, Australia and New Zealand.","detailedDescription":"The participant eligibility criteria specifically identify adults with history of symptomatic spontaneous ICH. Randomisation occurs if a participant and their doctor are uncertain about whether to start or avoid antiplatelet monotherapy at least 24 hours after ICH symptom onset. The intervention is a pragmatic policy of starting antiplatelet monotherapy (one antiplatelet drug available in local standard clinical practice, chosen by patient's physician pre-randomisation). The control group adopts a policy of avoiding antiplatelet therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["stroke","intracerebral hemorrhage","antiplatelet therapy","aspirin","clopidogrel","cilostazol"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Start antiplatelet monotherapy (one antiplatelet drug available in local standard clinical practice, chosen by patient's physician pre-randomisation).","interventionNames":["Drug: Start antiplatelet monotherapy"]},{"label":"Comparator","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Avoid antiplatelet therapy."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Start antiplatelet monotherapy","description":"Start one antiplatelet drug, be available in local standard clinical practice, chosen by patient's physician pre-randomisation","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"regulatory approvals","description":"Receipt of regulatory approvals in China，Australia and New Zealand separately, including Ethics, Human Genetics Resources Administration of China (HGRAC).","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"trial database","description":"Trial database structure and data flows that comply with data privacy and information governance regulations in China, Australia and New Zealand.","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Site recruitment","description":"Participation of 20 sites in China and 10 sites in Australia and New Zealand","timeFrame":"12-18 month"},{"measure":"Calculate frequency of clinical data","description":"Frequency of ICH survivors who are screened, eligible, approached, consented, and randomised by month and site from activation.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Barriers to randomisation of eligible patients.","description":"Barriers to randomisation of eligible patients.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Frequency of protocol deviations and violations.","description":"Frequency of protocol deviations and violations.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Adherence to the allocated intervention by investigators and participants","description":"Adherence to the allocated intervention by investigators and participants","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Frequency of withdrawal and loss to follow-up","description":"Frequency of withdrawal and loss to follow-up","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Completeness of follow-up assessments","description":"Completeness of follow-up assessments","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Characteristics of randomised participants compared with eligible patients who were not recruited.","description":"Characteristics of randomised participants compared with eligible patients who were not recruited.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Frequency of the composite of all serious vascular events","description":"composite of all serious vascular events (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from a vascular cause)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Serious adverse event (SAE)","description":"any serious adverse event (SAE)","timeFrame":"at least 6 months"},{"measure":"Serious adverse reaction (SAR)","description":"serious adverse reaction (SAR)","timeFrame":"at least 6 months"},{"measure":"Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)","description":"Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)","timeFrame":"at least 6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
