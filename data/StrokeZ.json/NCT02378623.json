The investigators are conducting this study to determine if the anticoagulant medication Apixaban is more effective at reducing MRI detected brain lesions compared to placebo.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\n400 patients who meet the study eligibility criteria and consent for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention with apixaban or control group with placebo. The randomization will be performed by a computer generated block randomization protocol. The majority of patients will begin intervention with Apixaban or placebo at the time of cardiac device placement (n approximately 300), and at least a quarter of the randomized patients (n ≥100) will include preexisting CIED (≥6 months) in place. Each patient will undergo a baseline MRI and a comprehensive cognitive screening examination. Repeat MRI and cognitive assessment will be performed at a follow-up period of two years from date of randomization (or less if clinical stroke/TIA occurs prior to this follow-up period). All subjects will receive a phone call at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months post-randomization to assess for endpoints and adverse events, as well as changes in clinical status, medications, and to assess study medication compliance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patent Foramen Ovale","Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device"],"keywords":["paradoxical embolism","lead thrombus","ICD","Pacemaker","Cognitive decline","Stroke","TIA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Apixaban","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention group: Apixaban 5 mg by mouth two times daily in addition to usual medical therapy (or 2.5 mg two times daily for subjects who fulfilled any 2 of the following criteria: age≥80 years, body weight≤60kg, and/or serum creatinine≥1.5 mg/dL).
