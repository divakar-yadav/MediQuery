Several research groups have developed the robotic devices and examined their efficacy on improving upper limb function after stroke. All these robotic devices have been applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the optimal treatment intensity, and the impact on physiological responses is still lacking.\n\nThis trial is to examine (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in RT on sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in RT by conducting a 6-month follow up evaluation; and (3) the effects of RT on cortical/movement reorganization as well as on the physiological markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and erythrocyte deformability. These overall findings will help better understanding of the efficacy of RT on functional outcomes, brain and movement reorganization, and physiological markers.","detailedDescription":"Subacute stroke participants will be recruited from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and then were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: RT with higher-intensity group, RT with lower-intensity group, and conventional intervention group. Assessments on sensorimotor impairments (Fugl Mayer Assessment, Motor Status Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Myoton, Muscle Metabolism, Box and Block Test, and Revised Nottingham Sensory assessment) and functional performance (Functional Independence Measure, Motor Activity Log, ABILHAND Questionnaire, Adelaide Activities Profile, EQ-5D-5L, and accelerometer) take about 40 minutes to complete. Evaluation of brain reorganization using functional magnetic resonance image and movement patterns by kinematic analysis take about 1 hour for each examination. Blood samples of the patients (12 ml.) will be collected to examine the physiological markers (ie, inflammation-related markers, oxidative stress markers, and erythrocyte deformability) before and after intervention. Total 24 ml blood will be collected in this study. Except for the blood taking, all the examinations are non-invasive."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Intensive Robot Assisted Therapy","Subacute Stroke","Brain Reorganization","Sensory Motor","Physiological Marker"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Higher-intensity RT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants received a duration-matched intervention for 90-120 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 4 consecutive weeks.

There have been several prototypes of Myoton. Present study will use MyotonPRO; the basic principle is the same in all prototypes but the MyotonPRO has several updates such as a triaxial accelerometer. Comparing with the single axis accelerometer in the earlier prototypes, MyotonPRO makes it more feasible for application.","timeFrame":"At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention"},{"measure":"Muscle metabolism (NIRS)","description":"Muscle metabolic dysfunction will be measured by the near-infrared ray spectroscopy (NIRS). The NIRS will be applied to both the affected and the unaffected arms. The NIRS sensor will be fixed on the targeted muscle of one of the forearms and a cuff is placed on the upper arm of the same side. The artery occlusion will be applied by inflating the cuff to a pressure of at least 60 to 80 above systolic pressure to block both venous outflow and artery inflow. The artery occlusion will last approximate 30 seconds then the cuff pressure is released. The decrease rate of oxyhemoglobin and the increase rate of deoxyhemoglobin during artery occlusion can reflect muscle's anaerobic metabolism during vasoconstriction. The hyperaemic response of the muscle during recovery phase can be characterized by reoxygenation rate and recovery time.","timeFrame":"At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention"},{"measure":"Box and Block Test (BBT)","description":"The BBT will be used as a test of manual dexterity.

Instruction of this test is \"I want to see how quickly you can pick up one block at a time with your right (or left) hand \\[point to the hand\\]. Carry it to the other side of the box and drop it. Make sure your fingertips cross the partition.\" The testing time is one minute. Then, the procedure will be repeated with the nondominant hand. After testing, the examiner should count the blocks.
