The combination of AI and CDSS is a potential solution to the shortage of medical resources and can improve the quality of and promote the standardization of medical services. At intervention sites, neurologists will receive support on use of the AI-based CDSS.\n\nAim: To evaluate the effectiveness of an AI-based CDSS for stroke management in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 7 days of symptom onset.\n\nIntervention: An AI-based CDSS for an integrated management of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The strategy includes automatically identifying acute stroke lesions and lesion patterns, automated classification of stroke subtypes and mechanisms, evidence-based alerts, and guideline-recommended secondary stroke prevention strategies.\n\nEighty eligible hospitals in china, stratified by hospital capacity (secondary grade or tertiary) and economic-geographical regions (eastern, central, and western), will be randomized into either the CDSS group or the usual care group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","artificial intelligence","clinical decision support system","cluster randomized controlled trial","evidence-based performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21689,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AI-based CDSS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
