The earlier the treatment, the greater potential for a therapeutic effect. However, logistical issues and safety concerns have prevented application of HBOT in the hyperacute window, particularly when coupled with recanalization therapy as the risk of hemorrhagic conversion is highest, monitoring intervals are short, and the natural history is being altered by another treatment. By enrolling patients who are in the subacute phase of stroke who are admitted to an inpatient rehab facility, the risk of HBOT is lower, monitoring intervals are longer, and the selected population has newly acquired and targetable stroke-related disability. Further, the patients are in a supervised setting and available for daily one-hour treatments without disrupting their intensive multidisciplinary rehab plan thereby minimizing nonadherence to daily treatments. Neuroimaging supports that injured, but not dead, brain cells can persist for months after an ischemic event. Hypoxia mediates cellular activity and death through multiple mechanisms. Ongoing decrease in oxygenation to the damaged area due to impaired blood flow works against cellular repair, recovery, and development of new synaptic connections. Increasing oxygen availability has been considered as an obvious treatment for stroke. HBOT has the potential to facilitate the recovery of injured or inactive neurons through increased blood flow and oxygen delivery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"100% oxygen under 2.0ATA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The first intervention arm consists of ischemic stroke patients who would undergo HBOT at 2.0 ATA with 100% oxygenation for 60 minutes x10 treatments (Monday-Friday of two sequential weeks).","interventionNames":["Device: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy"]},{"label":"21% oxygen under 2.0ATA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The second intervention arm would consist of ischemic stroke patients undergoing HBOT at 2.0 ATA with 21% oxygen (room air) for 60 minutes x10 treatments (Monday-Friday of two sequential weeks).","interventionNames":["Device: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy"]},{"label":"21% oxygen under 1.14ATA","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"For sham-control; ischemic stroke patients will undergo placement in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber for the same duration of time (60 minutes x10 treatments, Monday-Friday of two sequential weeks) and pressure maintained at 1.14 ATA with 21% oxygen (room air), a non-therapeutic dose of HBOT that sufficiently increases pressure to simulate ear popping, hence maintaining participants blinded to the intervention / sham.","interventionNames":["Device: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy","description":"Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy","armGroupLabels":["100% oxygen under 2.0ATA","21% oxygen under 1.14ATA","21% oxygen under 2.0ATA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacy outcome; change in total and subcomponents of functional independence measure (FIM)","description":"Difference in the total, motor, and cognitive functional independence measure (FIM) scores between the three arms at the end of respective treatment blocks (2 - week period).
