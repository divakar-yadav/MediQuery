The undiagnosed AF in cryptogenic stroke patients could be present but not revealed by rutinne ECG.","detailedDescription":"The subcutaneous Insertable Cardiac Monitor - Reveal® XT ICM, which provides long-term monitoring ( for 3 years), in selected stroke and TIA population on the basis of age, stroke etiology, and prescreening for cardiac arrhythmias helps to increase a detection of AF to 16.7% (range, 14.3% to 20.0%) in compare to ambulatory ECG detection of AF 6.4% (range, 5.3% to 9.0%). The AF detection after stroke and TIA strategically changes the therapeutic approach. In correlation with mentioned above the incidence of both specific genetic markers of AF and occurance of AF in this population and healthy volunteers are interesting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cryptogenic Stroke or TIA","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Cryptogenic stroke /TIA","Atrial Fibrillation","Implantable Loop Recorder","Genetic Mutation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":125,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cryptogenic Stroke or TIA"},{"label":"Healthy Volunteers","description":"Healthy Volunteers as comparative group adjusted to investigated group by age and gender"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Documented Atrial Fibrillation after episode of cryptogenic stroke / TIA Documented genetic mutation PITX2 and ZFHX3","description":"Documented Atrial Fibrillation after episode of cryptogenic stroke / TIA Documented genetic mutation PITX2 chromosome 4q25, polymorphism rs1906591,rs10033464 and ZFHX3 chromosome 16q22, polymorphism rs2106261","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to documented Atrial Fibrillation Reccurent stroke or TIA Stroke Secondary Prevention Therapy changes within 12 months Neuroimaging Changes ( brain CT/ MRI)","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Follow-up of patients with implanted ECG monitor REVEAL XT incidence of atrial fibrillation, stroke or TIA","timeFrame":"3 Years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.
