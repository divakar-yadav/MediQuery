Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices have been shown in the laboratory to allow participants to effectively communicate needs and engage in social communication. However, translation of this research to the home environment has been limited. In order to be a functional option for people to utilize, BCI needs to be much easier to set up and operate.\n\nThis study is designed to determine if telehealth intervention is sufficient to allow an untrained caregiver to set up and maintain a BCI for a person with a long-term communication difficulty given LIS.\n\nParticipants will receive a computer and associated hardware to allow for set up of the BCI. Videoconference support will be provided by the research team to allow the client and caregiver to set up the device in their home. Participants will hopefully be able to use the device to generate novel communication related to their care and engage in social needs with caregivers and/or family members. Communication that is generated will be logged and times that the participant is engaged in use of the BCI when not under direct support by the researchers will also be monitored.\n\nThe hypothesis is that telehealth support will be sufficient to allow for setting up the computer. If this is true, this will make it much easier for a client to engage in use of a BCI to allow for that communication versus the current need of traveling to a clinic or other specialized setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["locked in syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be provided with device; telehealth appts will be utilized to direct setup and usage of the device.","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"All Participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All Participants will receive trial device and will be trained (via Telehealth) in its use.","interventionNames":["Device: Use of BCI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Use of BCI","description":"Clients will utilize BCI with training to communicate wants and needs","armGroupLabels":["All Participants"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Log of communication","description":"Logs of any communication will be kept by monitoring number of accurate selections while utilizing the BCI.","timeFrame":"From date of enrollment in study until the date of discontinuation of the intervention, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis leading to severe communication impairment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Edward C Hitchcock, OT/L","role":"CONTACT","phone":"312 238 2997","email":"ehitchcock@sralab.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Colin Franz, MD","affiliation":"SRALAB","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"ShirleyRyan AbilityLab","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60611","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Edward C Hitchcock, OT/L","role":"CONTACT","phone":"312-238-2997","email":"ehitchcock@sralab.org"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000016472","term":"Motor Neuron Disease"},{"id":"D000000690","term":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000019636","term":"Neurodegenerative Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009468","term":"Neuromuscular Diseases"},{"id":"D000013118","term":"Spinal Cord Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000057177","term":"TDP-43 Proteinopathies"},{"id":"D000057165","term":"Proteostasis Deficiencies"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15105","name":"Sclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18569","name":"Motor Neuron Disease","asFound":"Lateral Sclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3714","name":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","asFound":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2155","name":"Locked-In Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21248","name":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12101","name":"Neuromuscular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15605","name":"Spinal Cord Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M28449","name":"TDP-43 Proteinopathies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M28437","name":"Proteostasis Deficiencies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T349","name":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","asFound":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"T4699","name":"Primary Lateral Sclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T3491","name":"Locked-in Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
