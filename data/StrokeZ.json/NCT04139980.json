The investigators believe that allowing users to interact with a computer-simulated reality environment will result in a pleasant experience, which will likely result in motivation and therapy engagement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality supported therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Virtual Reality (VR) interface will be used during patients stay at the rehabilitation center.
