Patients with an anterior cerebral circulation acute ischemic stroke and present between 4.5 to 24 hours of their last known well with a presenting NIH Stroke Scale Score \\>/=6 and an imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue will be eligible and will be approached for an informed consent for study participation. After informed consent is provided, the study will randomize to 4 doses of TS23 and placebo. The trial will enroll 300 subjects at up to 50 participating sites.\n\nThe effects of TS23 will be evaluated on two following primary outcomes using a utility function: 1) primary safety outcome: any intracerebral hemorrhage at 30 (+/-6) hours and 2) primary efficacy outcome: NIH Stroke Scale score at 30 (+/-6) hours after drug administration. The study will follow participants for 90 (+/-7) days.\n\nPrimary Objective: To identify a dose of TS23 that is safe and more efficacious than placebo for the treatment of patients from 4.5 to 24 hours of last known well, who have evidence of core-penumbra mismatch on perfusion imaging and are not a candidate for standard of care reperfusion therapies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Model Description: The first 50 subjects will be randomized equally to the five arms.
