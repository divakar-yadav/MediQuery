The chosen experimental design integrates biomechanical analyses, neuropsychological assessments, and brain imaging techniques to determine the impact of post-stroke cognitive impairment severity on two forms of motor learning (explicit and implicit) and examine the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the relationship between cognition and explicit motor learning. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of a more comprehensive, effective treatment approach to improve walking dysfunction in older adults post-stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)"],"keywords":["stroke","walking","rehabilitation","cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Evaluating motor learning and brain structures post-stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"We will use a single arm design to determine the impact of post-stroke cognitive impairment on two forms of motor learning (implicit and explicit) and evaluate the structural integrity of relevant brain structures in 65 individuals post stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Explicit motor learning","Behavioral: Implicit motor learning"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Explicit motor learning","description":"Participants will be provided with visual feedback of their right and left step lengths on a screen in front of a treadmill.","armGroupLabels":["Evaluating motor learning and brain structures post-stroke"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Implicit motor learning","description":"Participants will walk on a treadmill that drives their right and left legs to move at two different speeds.","armGroupLabels":["Evaluating motor learning and brain structures post-stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"step length asymmetry - change in performance","description":"characterized as a comparison between the right and left step lengths;
