Although the added movement of the shoulder blade when moving the post-stroke arm has been recommended in the literature, no studies to date have been found which directly looks at the impact of providing synchronized three-dimensional scapular and humeral movement during therapy. Due to the integral relationship between the scapula and the humerus during movement, it is hypothesized that an increase in 3-dimensional shoulder blade mobility in the painful post-stroke shoulder will contribute to increased pain-free 3-dimensional arm movement. This double-blind randomized-controlled study aims to investigate the effectiveness of this 3-D approach at addressing post-stroke shoulder pain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["Cerebral Vascular Accident","Stroke","Hemiplegic","Shoulder pain","range of motion","scapula","mobilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Current Standard Treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Current standard treatment for hemiplegic shoulder pain will be provided to this group.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard education/exercises for hemiplegic shoulder pain"]},{"label":"Standard treatment + study technique","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive current standard treatment for hemiplegic shoulder pain PLUS an additional stretching/strengthening technique.
