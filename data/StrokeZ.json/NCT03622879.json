It is hypothesize that MT combined with TENS would be superior to sham-mirror therapy with TENS, or MT with placebo-TENS, or control training only in improving lower limb motor functions and walking ability in people with stroke when combined with the lower limb task-oriented training.","detailedDescription":"The application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) over a paretic lower limb could augment the effects of task-oriented exercise therapy on lower limb motor function in people with stroke, possibly through increased excitability of sensorimotor cortex.\n\nIn mirror therapy (MT), the intact limb performs motor tasks while its mirror reflection is superimposed over the covered paretic limb, creating a visual illusion of enhanced function over the paretic limb. The visual input during MT could substitute for reduced proprioceptive inputs and increase spatial attention of the paretic limb, which could improve motor function of the paretic limb, possibly through increased cortical activity in the lesioned hemisphere and mirror neurone system.\n\nThe next question concerns whether MT could be combined with TENS and whether their synergetic effects could maximise the motor output of paretic limbs in people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Mirror therapy","Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MT + TENS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The subject will adopt a semi-seated position on a bed while the mirror board is positioned between the legs perpendicular to the subject's midline.
