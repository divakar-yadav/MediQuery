disabling stroke defined as NIHSS ≥ 6\n* In USA thrombolytic therapy (IV tPA) received within 3 hours of onset/ last known well, in Europe treatment with IV tPA received within 4.5 hours from onset/ last known well OR ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy\n* Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated \\< 8 hours from onset of symptoms or last known well time\n* Confirmed symptomatic large vessel occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, M1, M2, basilar or intracerebral vertebral artery by baseline neuroimaging CTA/MRA and angiographic imaging with a mTICI Score 0-1\n* For strokes in the anterior circulation the following imaging criteria should also be met: MRI criterion of volume of diffusion restriction visually assessed ≤50 mL OR CT criterion of ASPECTS 6 to 10 on baseline CT or CTA-source images or, significantly lowered cerebral blood volume (CBV) ≤50 mL\n* For strokes in the basilar or vertebral artery, the following imaging criterion should also be met: pc-ASPECTS score 8 to 10 on baseline CT, CTA-source images, or MRI\n* Signed informed consent from subject, acceptable person responsible (e.g. LAR) and/or according to County specific regulatory requirements and local ethical committee or review board requirements\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* CT or MRI evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on presentation\n* CT or MRI showing mass effect or intracranial tumor (meningioma \\> 2 cm in diameter).\n* Previous stroke within the past 3 months\n* Rapidly improving neurological status as determined by Investigator/Neurologist\n* Renal failure/insufficiency with \\>3.0 mg/dL creatinine prior to procedure\n* Severe, sustained hypertension resistant to treatment (SBP \\>185 mmHg or DBP \\>110 mmHg)\n* Use of warfarin anticoagulation with International Normalized Ratio (INR) \\> 3.0 at the time of the procedure or any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency\n* For patients who have received a direct thrombin inhibitor within the last 48 hours; partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\> 2.0 times the normal prior to procedure\n* Platelet count \\< 50,000 mm3\n* Cerebral vasculitis or evidence of active systemic infection\n* Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus, or suspicion of bacterial endocarditis\n* Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation)\n* Seizure due to stroke\n* Pregnancy\n* Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast\n* Presence of a carotid artery stenosis or occlusion requiring balloon angioplasty or stenting at time of the procedure\n* Difficult endovascular access or difficult aortic arch or severe neurovascular tortuosity that will result in an inability to deliver endovascular therapy\n* Evidence of dissection in the carotid or target artery for treatment\n* Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic\n* Active participation in another study involving an investigational drug or device\n* A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient\n* Unwillingness to complete follow up
