The HDRS-24 has two scoring methods: total scores and seven-category factor scores. A total score of 78 points, with higher scores indicating more severe depression: a score below 8 indicates no depression; a score of 8-20 indicates mild depression; a score of 20-35 indicates moderate depression; and a score of more than 35 indicates major depression. Seven types of factors are anxiety/somatization, weight, cognitive impairment, day and night changes, retardation, sleep disturbance, and sense of hopelessness.
