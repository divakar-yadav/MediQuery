Per year, approximately 17,000 Veterans are admitted to the VA for acute stroke. Chronic pain after stroke can occur between 10-50% of stroke survivors. Post-stroke pain (PSP) can lead to further complications in a stroke survivor's recovery. Exercise has improved PSP and associated symptoms such as mobility, fatigue, and quality of life. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique using electromagnetic induction for cortical neurostimulation. The use of rTMS has been explored shown to be effective in treating chronic PSP but is limited in effect duration. Our proposal will test the hypothesis that rTMS is feasible and safe to be paired with exercise. Additionally, the investigators believe a complementary effect can develop to enhance the neurostimulation duration of rTMS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Post-stroke Headache"],"keywords":["Vascular Headaches","post-stroke headache"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Feasibility of a double-blind sham-controlled intervention","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double-blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active rTMS+Exercise","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active rTMS","interventionNames":["Device: Active rTMS and exercise"]},{"label":"sham rTMS+Exercise","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham rTMS","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Sham rTMS+Exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active rTMS and exercise","description":"active","armGroupLabels":["active rTMS+Exercise"]},{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Sham rTMS+Exercise","description":"sham","armGroupLabels":["sham rTMS+Exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Visual Analogue Scale for Pain","description":"The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for pain.
