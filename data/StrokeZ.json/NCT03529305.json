Specifically, the investigators sought to determine whether rTMS treatment modulate the brain function and structure in patients and, if so, whether different frequency of the rTMS treatment will affect the degree of the motor recovery in patients' brain.\n\nThe patients will be randomized into three groups: Experimental group 1 (TMS group) received low frequency rTMS; Experimental group 2 (TMS group) received high frequency rTMS; The third group who received only physical therapy constituted the control group. All patients undergo MRI scan one day before and after rTMS treatment.","detailedDescription":"As the second leading cause of death and major cause of disability in the world, stroke is the rapid loss of brain function due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. Approximately two thirds of patients with stroke have impaired motor function even at three to six months after stroke onset. The abnormally increased interhemispheric inhibition driven from the unaffected to the affected hemisphere is associated with the motor impairment, which is characterized by increased cortical excitability in the unaffected hemisphere and decreased cortical excitability in the affected hemisphere. Rebalancing the cortical excitability between two hemispheres is associated with a better overall prognosis.\n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a painless, noninvasive brain stimulation technique. High-frequency rTMS facilitates cortical excitability, whereas low-frequency rTMS decreases the cortical excitability of the stimulated hemisphere. Therefore, rTMS can be used to increase and decrease the cortical excitability of the affected and unaffected hemispheres, respectively, and may facilitate motor function after stroke. However, the previous studies commonly applied behavioral scales to evaluate the effect of the rTMS treatment, little is known how the brain function and structure recover after rTMS treatment and whether the different frequency of rTMS will affect the recovery in the brain of stroke patients.\n\nNon-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide promising avenues to detect brain function and structure in patients after stroke onset and have been increasingly applied to this disease. The morphology of the brain (cortical thickness, gray matter volume) is commonly assessed using T1-weighted MRI (Structural MRI). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising technique to study human brain structure, especially white matter anatomy, by providing multiple quantitative parameters to characterize tissue microstructure from different aspects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a functional neuroimaging technique which measures the changes of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal that are highly correlated with neural activities. Task fMRI which applies stimulus-response pattern to identify the regions activated by performance of a cognitive task, while resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising tool to map intrinsic function of the human brain, which has unique advantages in clinical conditions because it does not require participants to engage in cognitive activities.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim to evaluate functional and structural improvements in the brain of stroke patients after rTMS treatment using multi-modal MRI techniques. Specifically, the investigators sought to determine whether rTMS treatment modulate the brain function and structure in stroke patients and, if so, whether different frequency of the rTMS treatment will affect the degree of the motor recovery in patients' brain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","rTMS","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low frequency rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive low frequency rTMS treatment and physical therapy. rTMS is applied over primary motor (M1) cortex of the unaffected side for two weeks, 5 consecutive days each week.","interventionNames":["Device: rTMS","Other: Physical therapy"]},{"label":"High frequency rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive high frequency rTMS treatment and physical therapy. rTMS is applied over primary motor (M1) cortex of the affected side for two weeks, 5 consecutive days each week.","interventionNames":["Device: rTMS","Other: Physical therapy"]},{"label":"Physical therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receive physical therapy for two weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"rTMS","description":"Receive rTMS treatment to the primary motor cortex (M1)","armGroupLabels":["High frequency rTMS","Low frequency rTMS"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Physical therapy","description":"Receive physical therapy","armGroupLabels":["High frequency rTMS","Low frequency rTMS","Physical therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain functional changes after rTMS treatment","description":"Brain functional changes in patients' brain measured by fMRI","timeFrame":"One day before and after two weeks' treatment"},{"measure":"Brain morphological changes after rTMS treatment","description":"Gray matter morphological changes in patients' brain measured by high resolution T1-weighted MRI","timeFrame":"One day before and after two weeks' treatment"},{"measure":"Brain structural changes after rTMS treatment","description":"White matter anatomical changes in patients' brain measured by DTI","timeFrame":"One day before and after two weeks' treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
