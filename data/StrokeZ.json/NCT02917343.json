Mirror therapy is a type of therapy mirror reflection of the stronger arm and hand helps to promote reorganization of neurons. Studies have shown that mirror therapy is an effective adjunct to regular exercise and task-oriented therapy.\n\nTo qualify for this study, participants must meet the following criteria: 1) age 21 years or more; 2) first-time stroke with onset of at least 3 months; 3) slight movement of the weaker arm or /and hand; 3) stable physical and mental health; and 4) mentally capable and competent to make health care-related decisions and carry out a home program.\n\nParticipants were required to come to Quinnipiac University - North Haven campus to undergo mirror therapy training, in 45-60 minute sessions, twice a week for one month. They were also required to complete pre-testing before and post-testing after the mirror therapy program. In addition, they were required to carry-out a home program that includes the use of a mirror box and self-selected tasks. The home program required them to exercise and practice the use of their more affected arm and hand for at least 1-2 hours a day.\n\nParticipation was strictly voluntary. Participants were informed of the minimal risks involved as well as their options to continue or withdraw from the study upon initial consent. The study did not yield physical or mental harm to the participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"participants received 4 weeks of mirror therapy and repetitive task training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: mirror therapy and repetitive task training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"mirror therapy and repetitive task training","armGroupLabels":["intervention arm"],"otherNames":["task oriented training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Patient Specific Functional Scale","description":"Patient Specific Functional Scale is a measure that involves self-rating of self-selected functional tasks","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 2 months"},{"measure":"Change in Fugl Myer Motor Assessment","description":"Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment is a clinical performance test of motor ability of the upper extremity","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Motor Activity Log","description":"The Motor Activity Log is a self-reported measure that captures the amount of arm and hand use and perception of movement quality of the impaired upper limb","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 2 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* able to give consent, complete home program\n* minimal arm and hand use with the paretic limb\n* onset of stroke of at least 3 months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\>1 stroke episode\n* significant cognitive and visual perceptual deficit\n* lack of social support","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29426386","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Bondoc S, Booth J, Budde G, Caruso K, DeSousa M, Earl B, Hammerton K, Humphreys J.
