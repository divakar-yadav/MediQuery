MTrPs are localized, hyperirritable points in the skeletal muscles that are associated with palpable nodules in muscle fibres. MTrPs can be classified into active and latent. Latent MTrPs demonstrate the same clinical characteristics as active MTrPs but they do not provoke spontaneous pain. Numerous studies have shown that MTrPs are prevalent in patients with chronic non-traumatic neck and shoulder pain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Pain","Shoulder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Pain intensity","description":"Visual Analogue Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPT)","description":"PPT will be assessed the shoulder Stroke (infraspinatus, supraspinatus, teres minor and upper trapezius).","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"Barthel index","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"DASH","description":"The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unilateral shoulder pain and a physician-diagnosed stroke.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Rheumatic inflammatory,\n* Systemic diseases,\n* Acute traumatic conditions,\n* Postoperative conditions, neck and elbow disorders, and\n* Serious aphasias in which there was a communication problem.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with a complaint of shoulder pain following a stroke were recruited to be subjects in the study following referral to physical therapy to the outpatient department at orthopedic rehabilitation facility by a family practice physician.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"JORGE H VILLAFAÑE, PhD","affiliation":"IRCCS Don Gnocchi Foundation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Jorge Hugo Villafañe","city":"Piossasco","state":"Turin","zip":"10045","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.98802,"lon":7.4601}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12756","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4202","name":"Oculocerebral Syndrome With Hypopigmentation","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
