The range of basic rehabilitation practices includes kinesiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and neuropsychology. Adjuvant methods include physiotherapeutic and medicinal methods. For this study, we chose MEXIDOL® as an adjuvant metabolic medicine, which has the ability to modulate receptor complexes of brain membranes, in particular benzodiazepine, GABA, acetylcholine, enhancing their ability to bind to specific ligands. This pharmacodynamic feature of the drug can have a positive effect on the psycho-emotional state of patients, which in turn will increase motivation and, consequently, the success of the rehabilitation process"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Acute Stroke","Cerebral stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Acute Cerebrovascular Accident","ACVA","Acute cerebral failure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mexidol and standart treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Mexidol"]},{"label":"Standart treatment","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Mexidol","description":"Ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate","armGroupLabels":["Mexidol and standart treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Schulte test","timeFrame":"66 days"},{"measure":"MoCA test","timeFrame":"66 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute Ischemic Stroke, MoCA test \\>15; ≤22\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Younger 18 years old; epilepsy; pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Brain Institute Clinic","city":"Ekaterinburg","state":"Sverdlovsk Region","zip":"623702","country":"Russian Federation","geoPoint":{"lat":56.8519,"lon":60.6122}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Acute","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4897","name":"Brain Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M628","name":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"C000070020","term":"Emoxypine succinate"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000000975","term":"Antioxidants"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"},{"id":"D000020011","term":"Protective Agents"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"},{"id":"D000010975","term":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000011619","term":"Psychotropic Drugs"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M249902","name":"Emoxypine succinate","asFound":"Ascorbic acid 500 mg","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3719","name":"Central Nervous System Stimulants","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3982","name":"Antioxidants","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21559","name":"Protective Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13555","name":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14164","name":"Psychotropic Drugs","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"PsychDr","name":"Psychotropic Drugs"},{"abbrev":"PlAggInh","name":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"CNSSti","name":"Central Nervous System Stimulants"}]}},"hasResults":false}
