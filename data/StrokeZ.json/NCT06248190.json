The specific questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. To test and estimate the effect of the intervention in people with MLTCs attending\n\n   PHCs on:\n\n   i. Detection of, and initiation of treatment for, additional chronic conditions ii. Treatment intensification and changes in medication iii. Control of chronic conditions iv. patient reported health-related quality of life and functioning v. health care utilisation and adherence vi. costs of health care\n2. To use the RE-AIM framework to assess implementation processes and outcomes through measurements of reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance.\n3. To understand implementation processes and outcomes within the wider context of primary healthcare, provide explanations for the observed effects of the clinical findings and identify recommendations for wider implementation of the ENHANCE intervention.\n\nThe participants in the control group will receive usual care at their primary health care facility, which includes the use of the Practical Approach to Care Kit (PACK) or Adult Primary Care (APC) clinical decision support tool. Participants in the intervention group will receive care for their multiple chronic condition by a clinician trained to use the ENHANCE clinical decision support tool (intervention tool), and receive two CHW visits in their home to provide treatment literacy and adherence support.","detailedDescription":"Control facilities Participants in control facilities will continue to receive usual care. Primary health care of long-term conditions is delivered free-at-point-of-care in public sector primary care facilities which includes the management of HIV, NCDs and mental health problems, according to South Africa's Ideal Clinic and Integrated Clinical Services Management model. This care model, which has combined the long-term care of HIV together with NCDs within each facility, has greatly enabled the feasibility of further interventions specifically addressing MLTCs and includes the Adult Primary Care (APC) or PACK clinical guidance. Patients attending these chronic services usually attend the same clinic regularly, 3 to 6-monthly for periodic monitoring of their chronic conditions. Chronic medication is collected monthly either at the facility (through fast-track queues), or through decentralised chronic medication dispensing systems which provide for collection from a range of sites including community venues (e.g. halls), wellness or adherence clubs, trailers, retail pharmacies (in KZN) or e-Lockers.\n\nIntervention clinics\n\nParticipants in intervention clinics will continue with usual care as described for control clinics but in addition will receive the ENHANCE health systems intervention comprising tools and implementation strategies that have been co-developed with stakeholders through an iterative process, drawing on:\n\ni. Evidence on the commonest MLTC combinations ii. Scoping reviews conducted on effectiveness of MLTCS interventions and systems barriers and enablers of person-centred care for MLTCs in LMICs iii. Provincial and district learning collaborative workshops with stakeholders from KZN and Western Cape.\n\niv. Clinical working groups with clinicians and health workers, a Guidance Oversight Board v. Input from our ENHANCE advocacy academy of 16 people living with MLTCs in the Western Cape and KZN\n\nThe intervention targets screening and early identification of other chronic conditions; improving follow-up and support for people with a new diagnosis, at risk of treatment failure (e.g. poorly controlled HIV or diabetes), and strengthen bi-directional referral pathways between the facility and community. Tools and implementation strategies will be layered into existing architecture of the chronic care system and support provision of more person-centred and empowering care across the treatment cascade.\n\nTools to support the implementation of the health systems intervention comprise:\n\n* An integrated clinical decision support tool for care of MLTCs drawing on PACK/ APC.\n* A range of patient-focussed materials to support condition, treatment, and systems (care-seeking) literacy (e.g., medication list, posters, scripts for health education talks)\n* A personal health diary (paper-based)\n\nImplementation strategies include:\n\n* 1 facility team session to introduce the ENHANCE study to the whole team\n* 3 clinical sessions for nurses and doctors\n* 2 sessions for community health workers and health promoters\n* Maintenance sessions to keep the ENHANCE intervention going for at least 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["HIV Infections","Hypertension","Diabetes Mellitus","Asthma","Depression","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke"],"keywords":["Multiple Chronic Conditions","Person Centered Care","Health Systems Intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study will be a type 2 hybrid trial, testing the effect of the intervention in improving clinical outcomes, and also testing and observing the effects of the intervention on implementation processes and outcomes using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework.
