Approximately 48 subjects will be enrolled in the trial, undergo a real or SHAM MSC IV infusion and will be follow out to 1 year. There will potentially be 4 Cohorts with the dose escalation at a 3:1 randomization schedule\n\nObjectives:\n\n* The primary hypothesis' are that intravenous administration of allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells is feasible and safe in patients with recent ischemic stroke and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IV MSCs when administered sub-acutely between 3-10 days following ischemic stroke.\n* The secondary hypothesis is that allogeneic MSC transplantation will improve functional outcome after recent ischemic stroke.\n\nSafety and clinical efficacy points to be evaluated at Day 7 clinic visit, Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, and Day 180. Primary outcome or Primary endpoint of the study is to define the safety or harm of the MSCs"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic","Stroke","Stem Cells","MSC","Allogeneic","Bone Marrow"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MSC infusion","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells given in one dose 3-10 days after stroke symptom onset","interventionNames":["Biological: MSC Infusion"]},{"label":"SHAM infusion","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Infusion of normal saline placebo","interventionNames":["Biological: Placebo Comparator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"MSC Infusion","description":"Allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells given in one dose 3-10 days after stroke symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["MSC infusion"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Placebo Comparator","description":"Normal saline","armGroupLabels":["SHAM infusion"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IV MSCs","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Improved functional outcome","description":"as assessed by changes in mRS, NIHSS, Fugyl-Meyer and Barthel Index","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. acute ischemic stroke\n2. age 18 to 83 years\n3. post stroke mRS \\> 3\n4.
