Up to 300 male and female patients with SAH undergoing endovascular repair of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm will be dosed with 2.60 mg/kg of NA-1 or placebo as a 10 minute intravenous infusion after completion of the endovascular procedure on Day 1 of the study period. Subjects will undergo interim procedures at Day 2-4, Day 30-45, and end-of-study procedures on Day 90."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysm"],"keywords":["Endovascular repair","Subarachnoid hemorrhage","Ruptured intracranial aneurysm","Stroke","Coiling","NA-1"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NA-1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"20 amino acid peptide that consists of a 9 amino acid domain that inhibits PSD-95 and an 11 amino acid domain that enables the peptide to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Patient should be Grade II-IV on the WFNS grading scale for SAH.\n* 3. Male or female with a minimum age of 18 years on the day of enrolment.\n* 4. Female subjects of childbearing potential: Negative pregnancy test.\n* 5. Non-surgically sterile males or males with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use condoms with spermicide for 3 months after completion of dosing.\n* 6. Body weight less than or equal to 180 kg.\n* 7. Vital signs on admission:\n\n  * Blood pressure between 80-180 mm Hg systolic/50-100 mm Hg diastolic;\n  * Body temperature ≤ 38.5C.\n* 8.

Prior SAH within 6 months of presentation.\n* 2. Dissecting or mycotic brain aneurysm.\n* 3. Planned endovascular vessel sacrifice as the primary modality for aneurysm treatment.\n* 4. Known history of life-threatening allergic reaction to any medication.\n* 5. Chronic renal disease defined as a baseline serum creatinine \\> 150 µmol/L.\n* 6. Women who are pregnant, or have a positive urine or blood (β-hCG) pregnancy test.\n* 7. Women who are breastfeeding.\n* 8.

Any other medical condition that the site investigator deems would put the patient at excessive risk of participation in the study or an expected life expectancy less than 1 year or that would result in inability to collect clinical outcomes at 90 days.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Michael Tymianski, MD, PhD","affiliation":"NoNO Inc.","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Cameron G McDougall, MD","affiliation":"Barrow Neurological Institute","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Michael D Hill, MD","affiliation":"Foothills Medical Centre","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Barrow Neurological Institute","city":"Phoenix","state":"Arizona","zip":"850139","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":33.44838,"lon":-112.07404}},{"facility":"Colorado Neurological Institute","city":"Englewood","state":"Colorado","zip":"801130000","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.64777,"lon":-104.98776}},{"facility":"University of Michigan - Neurosurgery","city":"Ann Arbor","state":"Michigan","zip":"481090000","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.27756,"lon":-83.74088}},{"facility":"Oregon Health and Science University","city":"Portland","state":"Oregon","zip":"97239-3098","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":45.52345,"lon":-122.67621}},{"facility":"University of Wisconsin","city":"Madison","state":"Wisconsin","zip":"537920000","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":43.07305,"lon":-89.40123}},{"facility":"Foothills Medical Centre","city":"Calgary","state":"Alberta","zip":"T2N 2T9","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":51.05011,"lon":-114.08529}},{"facility":"QEII Health Sciences Centre - Halifax Infirmary","city":"Halifax","state":"Nova Scotia","zip":"B3H 3A7","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":44.64533,"lon":-63.57239}},{"facility":"London Health Sciences Centre","city":"London","state":"Ontario","zip":"N6A 5A5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":42.98339,"lon":-81.23304}},{"facility":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M4N 3M5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"St. Michael's Hospital","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M5B 1W8","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"Toronto Western Hospital","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M5T 2S8","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"Hopital de l'Enfant Jesus","city":"Quebec City","state":"Quebec","zip":"G1J 1Z4","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":46.81228,"lon":-71.21454}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000013345","term":"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"},{"id":"D000002532","term":"Intracranial Aneurysm"},{"id":"D000000783","term":"Aneurysm"},{"id":"D000006470","term":"Hemorrhage"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000020300","term":"Intracranial Hemorrhages"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020765","term":"Intracranial Arterial Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9246","name":"Hemorrhage","asFound":"Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3803","name":"Aneurysm","asFound":"Aneurysm","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5471","name":"Intracranial Aneurysm","asFound":"Intracranial Aneurysm","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15825","name":"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","asFound":"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19488","name":"Aneurysm, Ruptured","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21803","name":"Intracranial Hemorrhages","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22211","name":"Intracranial Arterial Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
