Participants will also be provided an activity monitor to help them track and target their walking practice to determine if this can improve walking ability.","detailedDescription":"This multi-site study will have each site start in usual care with participants consented to collecting outcome measures. The twelve inpatient stroke units include: Kelowna General Hospital, Nanaimo Regional General Hospital, Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital, Saskatoon City Hospital, Wascana Rehabilitation Centre, Joseph Brant Hospital, Bruyère Hospital, Freeport Grand River Hospital, CIUSSS-de-l'Estrie-CHUS Centre de réadaptation de l'Estrie, Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche en réadaptation et intégration sociale, Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Each site will randomly switch over to Enhanced Usual Care (best practice implementation) where all physical therapists at the site will be educated on delivery of best practice for locomotor retraining. The specific therapy activities are at the discretion of the physical therapist; however, physical therapists must work towards thirty minutes of weight-bearing/stepping activity at greater than forty percent heart rate reserve. Participants will continue to be consented to collecting outcome measures. Additionally, participants will be given and trained to use activity watches to monitor their own progress."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Infarction, Brain"],"keywords":["Stroke","Lower extremity","Rehabilitation","Wearable device","Exercise","Clinical Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"This clinical trial uses a stepped-wedge design.
