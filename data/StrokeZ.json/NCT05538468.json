Material and Method: Thirty patients aged between 25-70 years who had a stroke at the earliest 6 months and who Functional Ambulation Scale were level 2 and above according to the were included in the study. Patients were selected by random sampling method from the relevant population. Demographic data were obtained from all subjects who met the inclusion criteria. Patients were evaluated Kinesiophobia scores (Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale (TKÖ) and VAS-Kinesiophobia Assessment), depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory), postural control loss (PASS) and pain severity (VAS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Kinesiophobia","Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["Kinesiophobia","stroke patients","Pain","Postural control","Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Patients Group","description":"The kinesiophobia scores of the patients were evaluated by (Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale) and (Visual Analog Scale- Kinesiophobia Assessment), depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory), postural control (Postural Assessment Scale), pain severity (Visual Analog Scale).","interventionNames":["Other: Assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Assessment","description":"Thirty stroke patients were included in the study.

The Visual Analog Scale was used as the second method in the assessment of kinesiophobia. A scale is drawn on a 10-centimeter (cm) horizontal line to show the start as 0 (no fear of movement) and the end as 100 (violent fear of movement). They were asked to stand up just before starting the exercise and to mark the severity of the fear of movement they felt at that moment on the scale.","timeFrame":"6 mounts"},{"measure":"Kinesiophobia Assessment","description":"Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale were used. The Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale (TKS) is one of them, and it's commonly used in the literature to assess kinesiophobia. It has 17 questions designed to assess fear of moving.","timeFrame":"6 mounts"},{"measure":"Pain Assessment","description":"Pain Assessment Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used. On a 10-centimeter (cm) horizontal line, start 0 (no pain) and finish 10 (unbearable pain) are marked and the subjects were asked to place a mark on this horizontal line according to the degree of pain they felt. The point marked on the line was then measured with the help of a ruler and recorded as the VAS value in cm.","timeFrame":"6 mounts"},{"measure":"Postural Control Assessment","description":"Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) was used. The scale, which consists of 12 items, is grouped at 4 different levels (0-3). It is a 2-part scale that assesses the ability to maintain the posture (5 items) and change it (7 items).","timeFrame":"6 mounts"},{"measure":"Depression Severity Assessment","description":"Depression Severity Assessment, The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was employed, which consists of 21 questions.
