The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the antiseizure medication reduce the functional connectivity of seizure networks, as identified by resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), within this specific target population?\n* What is the prevalence of seizure networks in patients from the target population, both with EEG suggestive and not suggestive of epileptogenic activity?\n\nParticipants will have a rs-fMRI and those with seizure networks will receive treatment with two antiseizure medications and a post-treatment rs-fMRI. Researchers will compare the pretreatment and post-treatment rs-fMRIs to see if there are changes in the participant's functional connectivity including seizure networks and typical resting state networks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injuries, Acute","Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Brain Ischemia","Brain Hypoxia","Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain","Heart Arrest","Stroke","Intracranial Hemorrhages","Coma","Persistent Vegetative State"],"keywords":["Coma","Vegetative state","Suppression of consciousness","antiseizure medication","Brain networks","Functional connectivity","Unresponsive wakefulness","Functional MRI","Resting state","Brain Injuries, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Subjects will be enrolled irrespective of their electroencephalogram (EEG) results, whether positive(+) or negative(-) for epileptogenic activity. All enrolled subjects will undergo an initial resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). The results will categorize the patients based on the presence or absence of seizure networks (SzNET), resulting in 2 groups: SzNET+ and SzNET-. SzNET- participants will not undergo further interventions or tests, while SzNET+ subjects will be assigned to the intervention arm and will receive follow-up rsfMRI and EEG.\n\nThe study aims to fill 2 quotas in its intervention arm: Participants who are both SzNET+ and EEG+, and another for those SzNET+ but EEG-. Once either of these quotas is complete, the study will cease screening subjects with EEG results falling into that quota. The subjects discharged from hospital on antiseizure medications for medical reasons will be followed up at 3 months post-discharge to collect exploratory data","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Seizure network Positive subjects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group encompass all SzNET-Positive subjects, including those who are EEG-Positive and EEG-Negative.

Maintenance doses should be administered every 12 hours, commencing 12 hours after the loading dose, with a maximum of 19 maintenance doses allowed. A second rs-fMRI and EEG will be conducted after participants have received at least five maintenance doses.\n\nFollowing these follow-up rs-fMRI and EEG assessments, the use of the intervention drugs as part of the research intervention will be discontinued. However, if medically necessary, these drugs can continue as part of regular therapy. It's important to note that repeat EEG and rs-fMRI assessments cannot be conducted if more than 72 hours have passed since the last dose of the intervention drug regimen.","interventionNames":["Drug: Phenobarbital Sodium Injection","Drug: Levetiracetam","Drug: Lacosamide Injectable Product","Drug: Valproate Sodium","Drug: Phosphenytoin"]},{"label":"Seizure network Negative subjects","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants in this group encompass all SzNET-Negative subjects, including those who are EEG-Positive and EEG-Negative.
