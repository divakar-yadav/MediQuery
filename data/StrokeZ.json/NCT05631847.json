However, it is still inconclusive whether there is any differences between endovascular therapy with or without bridging intravenous thrombolysis in acute BAO. So far, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted specifically for endovascular therapy with or without intravenous thrombolysis for ischemic stroke due to BAO. Therefore, this study plans to conduct a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to compare the functional outcomes between endovascular therapy with and without intravenous thrombolysis in patient with AIS due to BAO.\n\nThis study is a multicenter, parallel, open label, randomized controlled trial comparing direct endovascular therapy versus endovascular therapy bridging intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). This study intends to include patients with AIS due to BAO fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: patients with AIS caused by BAO confirmed by CTA/MRA/DSA; IVT can be started within 4.5 hours after symptoms onset; Age ≥ 18 years old; NIHSS score ≥ 6.\n\nThe main outcome is the 3-month mRS scale score. Secondary outcomes included NIHSS at 24 hours and 7 days after surgery, CTA vascular recanalization at 24-72 hours, mRS at 5-7 days, and infarct volume. The safety outcomes included 90-day mortality and the incidence of sICH."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Basilar Artery Occlusion","Thrombosis","Alteplase","Endovascular Treatment"],"keywords":["Endovascular treatment","Alteplase","Acute ischemic stroke","Basilar artery occlusion","Intravenous thrombosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":336,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Direct endovascular treatment group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Direct endovascular treatment (EVT) without intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular treatment"]},{"label":"Bridging treatment group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) followed by endovascular treatment (EVT)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular treatment","Drug: Intravenous thrombolysis (Alteplase)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular treatment","description":"It is the emergency surgical removal of emboli which are blocking blood circulation.
