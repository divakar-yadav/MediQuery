Treatment groups will attend individualized CBCT programme using CogniPlusÂ® while control group will continue attend conventional treatment as usual (TAU). Assessment on the means difference in assessing functions will be done after the study.\n\nSamples:\n\n100 patients with stroke will be recruited from the community, using a sampling frame of selected diagnosis and homogeneity.\n\nExpected Findings:\n\nFind out the training effects of selected CBCT on EF and daily functioning in patients with stroke","detailedDescription":"It is important to study the effectiveness of intervention post-stroke cognitive deficits in EF, Post-stroke patients with EF deficits will affect their abilities to successfully return to normal daily activity. Studies over the past decade have provided evidence of substantial gaps in our knowledge on how to effectively manage EF impairment post-stroke. To address these gaps there has been growing attention and research into the management of EF impairment post-stroke. Studies have been conducted to address some of these gaps specific to EF impairment and intervention research, and to investigate use of evidence-based practices for the management of EF impairment post-stroke. The literatures review of EF interventions identified different treatment approaches that were showing promise in helping persons with stroke to cope with EF deficits. The preliminary evidence on specific EF skill retraining suggested that structured, individualized, and intense computerized EF training could improve targeted EF impairments. Stroke patients with EF deficits often find it difficult in their daily activities, the impact of treatment might have potential to enhance rehabilitation and recovery. The translational framework described in (figure IV) describe ways to identify and investigate the evidence for the use of CBCT in specific EF interventions post-stroke. The study is thus required to find the impact of CBCT on a variety of outcomes, including not only measures of EF impairment, but also measures of daily activities and participation in everyday life situations that are affected in stroke patients having EF disorders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Executive Dysfunction","Cognitive Impairment","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Single blinded","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental CBCT Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants of CBCT group will attend individual computer-based cognitive training sessions.

The more categories achieved (range 0 to 6) and less perseverative errors (out of 128 trials) the better executive control. Moreover, the lower the total number of trials administered (total number of cards used) reflects greater efficiency of the participant in the task; in addition, the greater the total number of correct responses (number of successes in combinations according to the category) and the lower the total number of errors (number of incorrect combinations) also indicate the better the participant's performance.","timeFrame":"Baseline, after completion of half of the programme (an average of 8 weeks), one month post-treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
