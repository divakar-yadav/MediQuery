Each task was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (from 0 to 4). A score of 0 denotes the inability of the participant to perform the task, and a score of 4 denotes that the participant can complete the task based on a preset criterion. The highest possible score is 56.","timeFrame":"Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in four groups"},{"measure":"Change of Motor evoked potential (MEP)","description":"Motor evoked potential (MEP) is recorded from tibialis anterior muscles following direct transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex. All TMS is delivered with the participant seated upright on the chair. Both passive and active conditions, participants are instructed to relax their right leg in the seated position. TMS is delivered over the motor cortex (M1) using a concave double cone coil (Magstim Co., United Kingdom) attached to a BiStim magnetic stimulator (Magstim Co., United Kingdom). To locate the optimal site, stimuli are delivered over various points along the M1. The optimal site is the location on the M1 that evoked the greatest MEP amplitude in the bilateral tibialis anterior muscles. The onset latency and onset to peak amplitude will be assessed.","timeFrame":"Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in four groups"},{"measure":"Change of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)-Lower extremity","description":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower extremity is used to measure lower-limb recovery in stroke rehabilitation studies.The scale has 6 items ranging from reflex activity to voluntary motor control. Each item further comprises components, with a total of 17. Scoring is done on a 3-point ordinal scale ranges from 0 (no performance) to 2 (faultless performance). The total score range from 0 (no motor function) to 34 (good motor recovery).","timeFrame":"Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in four groups"},{"measure":"Change of Multi-directional Reach Test (MDRT)","description":"Participants will be required to reach in the forward, left and right directions. The test is performed with the participant in standing. It is the measure of the difference, in centimeters, between arm's length with arms at 90Â° flexion/ abduction and maximal forward, left and right directions reaching respectively, using a fixed base of support. The test uses a centimeters measuring device against a wall at shoulder height.","timeFrame":"Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in four groups"},{"measure":"Change of The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS)","description":"The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) is a postural assessment scale specifically designed to assess and monitor postural control after stroke. It contains 12 four-level items of varying difficulty for assessing ability to maintain or change a given lying, sitting, or standing posture. The PASS consists of 2 sections with a 4-point scale to describe each task. The total score ranges from 0 - 36. A score of 0 denotes the inability of the participant to perform the task, and a score of 3 denotes that the participant can complete the task based on a preset criterion.

The TDQ, which is a 4-point scale with 18 items, is a culturally specific depression self-rating instrument for effective screening of depression in Taiwan and has satisfactory reliability and validity. Subjects are guided to rate each item on a scale from 0 to 3 on the basis of \"how often you felt the physical and emotional aspects during the past week\". Zero denotes never, three means always.
