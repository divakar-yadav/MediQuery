They will be attending for their routine pacemaker checks in a number of clinics in Surrey.\n\nPotential participants will have documented prolonged paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF, an intermittent irregular heart rhythm which is known to predispose to stroke), lasting at least 12 hours, identified in the last month prior to the pacemaker check.\n\nWilling patients will then be issued with a PHRM (Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor) device to make heart rhythm recordings for 3 months. They will do this twice-daily for 30 seconds for this period. At the end of the 3 month period patients will undergo a final pacing device check. Identification of prolonged PAF using the PHRM device will be compared to the implantable device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Intermittent cardiac monitoring","Implantable device"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intermittent cardiac monitoring with a Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor for three months.","interventionNames":["Device: Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor","armGroupLabels":["Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor"],"otherNames":["Portable ECG monitor HCG-801 - OMRON Healthcare"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The sensitivity and specificity of detection of prolonged paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) using a Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor (PHRM), compared to an implantable device.","description":"Measured (%) as the number of identified episodes of prolonged PAF using the PHRM compared to the gold standard implantable device in all patients over the 3 month period.","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The sensitivity and specificity of detection of all episodes of PAF using a PHRM, compared to an implantable device.","description":"Measured (%) as the number of identified episodes of all episodes of PAF (lasting at least 30 seconds) using the PHRM compared to the gold standard implantable device in all patients over the 3 month period.","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Participant compliance with twice-daily recordings with the PHRM for a three month period.","description":"Measured as actual number of recordings made out of 180 requested recordings and expressed as a percentage.","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"The concordance of the interpretation of PHRM recordings by a Research Nurse and blinded Cardiologist.","description":"The agreement in the diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm and PAF using PHRM recordings between a Research Nurse and Cardiologist expressed as a percentage.","timeFrame":"18 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prolonged AF (defined as an episode at least 12 hours duration) in the last month whilst attending routine pacemaker check\n* Pacing requirement \\< 25% during the last month\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Lack of capacity\n* Inability to use the Personal Heart Rhythm Monitor due to cognitive or physical impairment\n* Commencement of new anti-arrhythmic drug since last pacemaker check","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Philippa J Howlett, MBChB MRCP","affiliation":"The University of Surrey and The Royal Surrey County Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"St Peter's Hospital","city":"Chertsey","state":"Surrey","zip":"KT16 0PJ","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.38812,"lon":-0.50782}},{"facility":"Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","city":"Guildford","state":"Surrey","zip":"GU2 7XX","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.23536,"lon":-0.57427}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"HASTE charity website","url":"http://www.haste.uk.com/"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
