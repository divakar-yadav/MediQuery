As it is known, it is important for patients to regain functional skills in the upper extremities after stroke. Modified-Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (m-CIMT) is a versatile neurorehabilitation technique that aims to improve motor function in the hemiparetic upper extremity and increase its use in daily life activities. However, as in the Covid-19 pandemic, patients cannot always reach rehabilitation services. In such cases, telerehabilitation is a treatment option. There are a limited number of studies in which m-CIMT is applied according to the principle of telerehabilitation, which has become a necessity, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of m-CIMT on upper extremity motor functions in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study is a randomized controlled study. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups as exercise and control. Patients in both groups will be given lower-upper extremity exercises and gait training exercises selected according to the Bobath approach as a home program consisting of 10 exercises to be applied 5 days a week for 3 weeks. All patients will perform the same exercises. In addition, the exercise group will receive Modified-Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (m-CIMT) based telerehabilitation via video conferencing 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Patients in the m-CIMT group will be asked to restrict the movements of their less affected hands by using mitt for 5 hours a day/ 5 days a week for 3 weeks while the patients are awake. Evaluations for both groups will be made by a physiotherapist blinded to the study twice, at the beginning and 3 weeks later. As outcome measures functional performance, hand strength, activities of daily living and quality of life will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Telerehabilitation","modified-Constraint Induced Movement Therapy","Upper Extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups as exercise group and control group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The group will receive modified-Constraint Induced Movement Therapy via telerehabilitation and a home exercise program.","interventionNames":["Other: Exercise","Other: Home program"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The group only will be given a home exercise program.","interventionNames":["Other: Home program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exercise","description":"M-CIMT-based telerehabilitation will be implemented.","armGroupLabels":["Exercise Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home program","description":"Lower and upper extremity exercises and gait training exercises selected according to the Bobath approach will be given as a home program consisting of 10 same exercises.","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Exercise Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper extremity motor ability-Baseline","description":"Wolf Motor Function Test","timeFrame":"Assessment will be conducted before the intervention."},{"measure":"Upper extremity motor ability-Post intervention","description":"Wolf Motor Function Test","timeFrame":"Assessment will be conducted immediately after the intervention."},{"measure":"Upper extremity motor function-Baseline","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity","timeFrame":"Assessment will be conducted before the intervention."},{"measure":"Upper extremity motor function-Post intervention","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity","timeFrame":"Assessment will be conducted immediately after the intervention."},{"measure":"Activities of daily living related to the upper extremity-Baseline","description":"Motor Activity Log-28 (MAL-28) The minimum score that can be obtained from this scale is 0, and the maximum score is 5.
