Up to 10 patients will receive up to 500x 10 6 autologous bone marrow cells injected intra-arterially into the middle cerebral artery through percutaneous approach. The procedure is monitored by Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Other 5 patients will receive up to 500x 10 6 autologous bone marrow cells injected intravenously. Changes in neurological deficits and improvements in functions will be evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals during follow-up ( 4 months). EEG and neuroimaging exams will be performed at baseline and at regular intervals during the follow-up period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Infarction, Middle Cerebral
