The subjects will be fit with the device, provided general training in the operation of the EMG-controlled technology, and then guided through a series of standard clinical outcome measures used routinely as part of stroke rehabilitation medicine. The outcome measures employed in this study include the Fugl-Meyer assessment, the Box and Blocks test, and a battery of common functional tasks and activities. These outcome measures will allow the researchers to approximate the changes in the subjects' ability to successfully perform functional tasks with and without the MyoPro device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accidents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand Orthosis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand orthosis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand orthosis","description":"An arm orthosis that uses myoelectric signals to control the level of mechanical assistance provided to a user's elbow and hand in order to overcome upper limb weakness or paralysis and achieve functional tasks.","armGroupLabels":["Myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand Orthosis"],"otherNames":["MyoProÂ®"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE)","description":"Assessment of sensorimotor function for the upper extremities (arms)\n\nhttp://www.rehabmeasures.org/lists/rehabmeasures/dispform.aspx?ID=908","timeFrame":"2 hours"},{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Measurement of muscle spasticity due to nervous system injury or disease\n\nhttp://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=902","timeFrame":"2 hours"},{"measure":"Box and Blocks Test","description":"An assessment of unilateral gross manual dexterity, measured by the number 1 inch cubes an individual can move over a barrier in a 60 second time period.\n\nhttp://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=917","timeFrame":"2 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults over 18 years.\n* Upper limb impairment caused by any stroke (CVA)\n* Minimum of trace MMT (1/5) in Biceps and/or Triceps\n* Full Passive range of motion in elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand\n* Active shoulder flexion of at least 30 degrees of shoulder abduction of at least 20 degrees\n* Score of at least 20 on the Mini Mental Status Examination.\n* Ability to read and comprehend the English language.\n* Ability to generate consistent, detectable EMG signal from the upper arm and forearm sensor sites with wrist in neutral or flexed positions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Fixed upper limb contractures on affected side.\n* Subjects with severe spasticity or tone (defined as 3 or more on the Modified Ashworth Scale).\n* Inability to follow three step directions.\n* Severe shoulder subluxation, pain or shoulder dislocation.\n* Passive shoulder range of motion less than 45 degrees in flexion and abduction.\n* Pain or hypersensitivity in the arm(s)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jonathan Naft, CPO, LPO","role":"CONTACT","phone":"440-285-5785","email":"jnaft@greop.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"GRE Chardon","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Chardon","state":"Ohio","zip":"44024","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Jonathan Naft, CPO, LPO","role":"CONTACT","phone":"440-285-5785","email":"jnaft@greop.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.61422,"lon":-81.14899}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
