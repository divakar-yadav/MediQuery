Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, and 12 months post-procedure and annually for 1 year within 3 years.","detailedDescription":"Stroke has been one of the most important causes of disability and death worldwide today. Ischemic stroke accounts for more than 50% of these strokes. The results of epidemiological surveys show that in 2018, more than 3 million new strokes occurred each year in China. In 2018, more than 3 million people suffered from a stroke, and more than 2 million people died from a stroke. Studies show that about 25% to 40% of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes occur in the posterior circulation. The subclavian and vertebral arteries are important blood vessels in the posterior circulation and are important original sites for ischemic strokes in the posterior circulation. About 20% of strokes in the posterior circulation are caused by extracranial vertebral artery stenosis (ECVAS). Endovascular intervention is the recommended treatment for ECVAS. It is effective in promoting the perfusion of brain tissue in the area of the responsible artery, thereby reducing the risk of stroke recurrence, improving neurological prognosis, and reducing symptoms. The drug-eluting stent is effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative restenosis (ISR), thus further reducing the long-term risk of stroke. Vertebral artery drug-eluting stents Maurora® was approved for marketing in 2020 and has been shown to be effective in reducing restenosis in clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to further investigate its long-term effectiveness in treating vertebral artery stenosis in the real world."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Vertebral Artery Stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":144,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with vertebral atherosclerotic stenosis requiring stent implantation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Referring to \"the 2015 Chinese Guidelines for Endovascular Interventional Treatment of Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease\", \"the 2015 Symptomatic Atherosclerotic Sclerotic vertebral artery initiation stenosis: Chinese expert consensus\" and \"Subclavian/extracranial vertebral artery stenosis: Chinese expert consensus\" in 2019 and other guidelines and expert consensus for the diagnosis of symptomatic vertebral artery atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 50% and non-symptomatic vertebral artery atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 70% in patients.","interventionNames":["Device: The drug-eluting stent"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"The drug-eluting stent","description":"Vertebral artery drug-eluting stents Maurora® was approved for marketing in 2020 and has been shown to be effective in reducing restenosis in clinical trials.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with vertebral atherosclerotic stenosis requiring stent implantation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of clinical ischemic events","description":"Examples of clinical cerebral ischemic events: TIA or ischemic stroke event in the blood supply area of the target lesion","timeFrame":"within 1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical Success Rate","description":"Successful arrival and release of the stent in the target lesion with complete coverage of the lesion and residual stenosis \\<30%, no major adverse events (MAE).","timeFrame":"within 1 year after surgery"},{"measure":"Major adverse event (MAE) incidence","description":"Major adverse events (MAE) include all-cause death, any type of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke) within 30 days of surgery, TIA or ischemic stroke in the target lesion supply area within 1 year, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TVL), thrombotic event.","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 and 3 years"},{"measure":"Incidence of bleeding events","description":"Access or non access site bleeding","timeFrame":"30 days and 1 year"},{"measure":"Incidence of in-stent restenosis","description":"Restenosis: in-stent stenosis rate ≥50% on imaging","timeFrame":"within 1 year"},{"measure":"Changes in the modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores","description":"ability to perform daily living，mRS scores ranges 0-6 ， the more score the more severe outcome","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 and 3 years"},{"measure":"Change in NIHSS scores","description":"NIHSS scores for neurological deficits","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 and 3 years"},{"measure":"Correlation of risk factors with the occurrence of major adverse events","description":"Major adverse events (MAE) include all-cause death, any type of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke) within 30 days of surgery, TIA or ischemic stroke in the target lesion supply area within 1 year, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TVL), thrombotic event.","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 and 3 years"},{"measure":"Correlation of risk factors with the occurrence of restenosis","description":"Thrombosis in study stents","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 and 3 years"},{"measure":"Evaluation of clinical use for relative contraindications","description":"Evaluation of clinical cerebral ischemic events: TIA or ischemic stroke event in the blood supply area of the target lesion for contraindications patients","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 and 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
