Two important complications of ischaemic stroke and its acute treatment are haemorrhage into the infarcted tissue and cerebral oedema. Leading to worsening functional outcome in survivors. Both are caused by a disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by ischemia of the brain vascular endothelium and associated cells involved in maintaining the BBB. Imatinib can reduce the damage to the BBB and hence reduce the formation of oedema and haemorrhage.\n\nThe study is a phase III randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-arm trilal of patents with acute ischaemic stroke. Assessing the Clinical variables at baseline and after 3 months.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo investigate if Imatinib (800 mg / day) treatment initiated within 8 hours of symptom onset and given for 6 days improves functional outcome at three months after acute ischaemic stroke\n\nSecondary objective:\n\n1. Investigate if Imatinib treatment improves functional outcome at three months in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with iv thrombolysis\n2. Investigate if Imatinib treatment improves neurological outcome at three months after acute ischaemic stroke\n3. Investigate if Imatinib treatment improves neurological outcome at three months in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with iv thrombolysis\n4. Investigate if Imatinib reduces the frequency and grade of ICH in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with iv thrombolysis\n5. Investigate if Imatinib reduces the frequency and grade of cerebral oedema in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with iv thrombolysis\n6. Examine serious and non-serious adverse events in patients treated with Imatinib\n7. Investigate if Imatinib reduces mortality at 3 months after acute ischaemic stroke\n8. Investigate if Imatinib reduces mortality at 3 months in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with iv thrombolysis"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischaemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischaemic stroke","Imatinib","blood-brain-barrier","trombectomy","iv trombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"The study is double-blind, only after the study is completed or terminated the treatments will be made available, or if requested by the data safety board, or if requested by treating clinician in association with possible SAE/SUSAR","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1260,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Imatinib","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Imatinib 400mg (2 tablets of 400mg) per day for 6 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Imatinib 400mg"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"2 placebo tablets per day for 6 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo Oral Tablet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Imatinib 400mg","description":"2 tablets of Imatinib 400mg per day for 6 days","armGroupLabels":["Imatinib"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo Oral Tablet","description":"2 tablets of placebo per day for 6 days","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional independency at 3 months as measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score 0-2.","description":"For a positive outcome, patients in the active group treated with Imatinib 800 mg per day will have statistically significant higher functional independency compared to the control group treated with placebo.","timeFrame":"3 months post treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in mRS score at 3 months compared to baseline","description":"For a positive outcome, patients treated with Imatinib will have a favorable shift of the scale.","timeFrame":"At baseline and 3 months post treatment"},{"measure":"Frequency (%) of ICH on post-treatment imaging scan in patients undergoing IV thrombolysis and or endovascular thrombectomy.","timeFrame":"1 day post treatment start"},{"measure":"Grade of ICH (COED 1-3) on post-treatment imaging scan in patients undergoing IV thrombolysis and or endovascular thrombectomy.","timeFrame":"1 day post treatment start"},{"measure":"Frequency (%) of cerebral oedema on post-treatment imaging scan in patients undergoing IV thrombolysis and or endovascular thrombectomy.","timeFrame":"1 day post treatment start"},{"measure":"Grade (COED 1-3) of cerebral oedema on post-treatment imaging scan in patients undergoing IV thrombolysis and or endovascular thrombectomy.","timeFrame":"1 day post treatment start"},{"measure":"Serious and non-serious adverse events","timeFrame":"3 months post teatment"},{"measure":"Mortality at 3 months.","timeFrame":"3 months post treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
