The outcomes of patients with severe stroke depend largely on medical strategies on acute stage, especially on nutritional support management. Unfortunately, clinical evidence are sparse and the ideal initial feeding strategy remains disputable.\n\nThe IF-STROKE study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of modified full enteral feeding (target recruitment 200) and permissive underfeeding in patients with acute severe stroke (target recruitment 200) compared to full enteral feeding (target recruitment 200). Patients presenting with acute (\\<72h) severe stroke (GCS ≦ 12 or NIHSS ≧ 11) and dysphagia (defined by Water Swallowing Test) will be randomly assigned to full enteral feeding, modified full enteral feeding, or permissive underfeeding treatment for 7 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Stroke","Acute Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["severe stroke","Acute Stroke","Enteral Feeding","Mortality","Disability","Clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":306,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Full enteral feeding","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The caloric goal of the first day is one-third of caloric requirements, the second day is half of caloric requirements, the third day is 70-100% and sustained for 1 week.
