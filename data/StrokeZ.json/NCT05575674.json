A retrospective record review will be done to collect data regarding MyoPro user outcomes for individuals that received a MyoPro starting January 2021 and after. Additional data types such as demographics and clinical outcomes will be gathered. Participants may complete at least one follow-up session to record responses to additional inquiries from the research team."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brachial Plexus Injury","Spinal Cord Injuries","Neurological Disease"],"keywords":["MyoPro"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand Orthosis","description":"An arm orthosis that uses myoelectric signals to control the level of mechanical assistance provided to a user's elbow and hand in order to overcome upper limb weakness or paralysis and achieve functional tasks.","otherNames":["MyoProÂ®"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)","description":"Validated outcome measure that asks an individual to self-report about the ability to perform certain upper limb activities.
