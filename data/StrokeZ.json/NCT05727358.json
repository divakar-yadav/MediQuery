The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Group-based ACT (G-ACT) could significantly reduce the depressive symptoms in patients with acute stroke,\n* the interventional efficacy could be maintained at 3-month follow-up\n* similar benefits would be observed for quality of life (QOL), sleep quality, psychological flexibility, cognitive fusion, and confidence.\n\nThe patients included to the control group received usual care support in hospital, and the patients included to the intervention group received G-ACT and usual care support. the G-ACT treatment in this study comprised 7 sessions of 45-60 minutes and was administered throughout the course of the 4-week long trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke Patients With Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":139,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"G-ACT","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy","description":"G-ACT treatment in this study comprised 7 sessions of 45-60 minutes and was administered throughout the course of the 4-week long trial.","armGroupLabels":["intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD or HDRS, 24 item)","description":"Each item is scored from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, a higher score indicates much more serious depression","timeFrame":"immediately after the intervention"},{"measure":"The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD or HDRS, 24 item)","description":"Each item is scored from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, a higher score indicates much more serious depression","timeFrame":"3 months after the intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)","description":"physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).A higher score reflects better HRQoL","timeFrame":"immediately after and 3 months after the intervention"},{"measure":"The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II)","description":"the total score ranges from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating less psychological flexibility.","timeFrame":"immediately after and 3 months after the intervention"},{"measure":"The Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ)","description":"scores range from 0 to 63 with a higher score indicating more fused one is with one's thoughts","timeFrame":"immediately after and 3 months after the intervention"},{"measure":"The confidence was assessed using the Confidence after Stroke Measure (CaSM)","description":"total scores ranging from 0 to 81 and higher scores representing higher confidence.","timeFrame":"immediately after and 3 months after the intervention"},{"measure":"The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)","description":"total scores ranging from 0 to 21 and higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.","timeFrame":"immediately after and 3 months after the intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. primary diagnosis of acute stroke, the last onset occurred within 2 weeks\n2. being over 18 years old\n3. scoring at least 8 on the HAMD scale\n4.
