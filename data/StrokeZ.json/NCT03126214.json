Despite robust evidence oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is effective and safe for stroke prevention in patients with AF; there is a lack of real-world application. Alternative strategies to deliver stroke prevention therapy need to be explored. Although pharmacists' prescribing of antihypertensive and lipid lowering drug therapy has been shown to increase adherence to guideline-based targets and warfarin management improve control of international normalized ratios in anticoagulation clinics, the role of pharmacist initiation of OAC therapy compared to usual care in AF patients for stroke prevention in a community setting is unclear.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will screen participants presenting to community pharmacies to identify participants with unrecognized AF and/or known AF but not taking blood thinners or not on optimal OAC therapy and randomize care to either the pharmacist or enhanced usual care (family physician notification by pharmacist)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","stroke","oral anticoagulation therapy","pharmacist case management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, open-label, randomized, stepped wedge trial design.
