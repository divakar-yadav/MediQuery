After the therapist places his hands on the area where the patient's suboccipital muscles connect the occiput, he asks the patient to relax and rest his head on his fingers. Therapist pays attention to positioning the fingertips in suboccipital area No traction is performed during this technique. The position is maintained until the patient is relaxed.

The device is controlled from a computer through its software, and the raw data it collects is sent to the computer via Bluetooth in real-time. The software analyzes the raw data collected by the device and converts it into results. For evaluation, we used the Modified Get Up and Go Test , which is supported by the device. We recorded the average times of the test by repeating it twice.
