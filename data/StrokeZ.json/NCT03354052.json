Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) promotes the modulation of brain activity and its prolonged and continuous application can effect plastic modification. Combining rTMS with rehabilitation treatment for primary motor cortex activation (using Gloreha® device) may have effect in reducing pain in stroke survivors. This is a pilot randomized control trial to test the effects of rTMS in stroke-related pain rehabilitation, its efficacy on pain, upper limb function, sensory function and autonomy in daily livings activities. Furthermore, we will explore the effects on pressure pain threshold, cortical excitability and EEG recording."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Pain","rTMS","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real-rTMS + Gloreha device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Real-rTMS + Gloreha device"]},{"label":"Sham-rTMS + Gloreha device","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Sham-rTMS + Gloreha device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Real-rTMS + Gloreha device","description":"The real rTMS will be delivered using a 8-shaped coil placed over the primary motor cortex (M1).
