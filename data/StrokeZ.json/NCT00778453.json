These findings may inform rehabilitation professionals about which treatment approach is superior to another one in certain aspect of outcome and who can benefit most from certain treatment approach. Accordingly, the results of this project may help us move quickly to design and develop efficient and effective rehabilitation programs for individualized patients.","detailedDescription":"The first purpose is to investigate the relative effects of modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) vs. bilateral isokinematic training (BIT) vs. traditional or therapist-based training (TR) on movement reorganization, motor performance, functional ability, and quality of life (QoL) immediately and six months later after treatment delivered at hospitals. Movement reorganization will be evaluated by kinematic instrument. Motor performance, functional ability, and QoL will be assessed using clinical assessment tools. By the same token, we also investigate the relative effects of these two approaches delivered at home. The second purpose is to study whether home-based mCIT is efficacious in various aspects of outcomes described above immediately and six months later following treatment, compared to home-based TR, and hospital-based mCIT and TR.We also study the same question regarding home-based BIT efficacy. The third purpose is to establish predictive models to predict functional and QoL outcomes immediately and six months later following mCIT and BIT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accidents"],"keywords":["stroke rehabilitation","kinematic analysis","upper extremity training","predictors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hospital-based mCIT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hospital-based modified constraint-induced therapy(mCIT)","interventionNames":["Other: Hospital-based mCIT"]},{"label":"Hospital-based BIT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hospital-based bilateral isokinematic training (BIT)","interventionNames":["Other: Hospital-based BIT"]},{"label":"Hospital-based TR","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hospital-based traditional rehabilitation (TR)","interventionNames":["Other: Hospital-based TR"]},{"label":"Home-based BAT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home-based bilateral arm training(BAT)","interventionNames":["Other: Home-based BAT"]},{"label":"Home-based TR","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home-based traditional rehabilitation (TR)","interventionNames":["Other: Home-based TR"]},{"label":"Home-based mCIT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home-based modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT)","interventionNames":["Other: Home-based mCIT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hospital-based mCIT","description":"restraint of the unaffected arm and practice of the affected arm","armGroupLabels":["Hospital-based mCIT"],"otherNames":["Hospital-based modified constraint-induced therapy(mCIT)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hospital-based BIT","description":"bilateral symmetric, repetitive arm training","armGroupLabels":["Hospital-based BIT"],"otherNames":["Hospital-based bilateral isokinematic training (BIT)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hospital-based TR","description":"hospital-based traditional rehabilitation : OT or PT or therapist-based training","armGroupLabels":["Hospital-based TR"],"otherNames":["Hospital-based traditional rehabilitation (TR)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home-based mCIT","description":"restraint of the unaffected arm and practices of the affected arm","armGroupLabels":["Home-based mCIT"],"otherNames":["Home-based modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home-based BAT","description":"bilateral symmetric, repetitive arm training","armGroupLabels":["Home-based BAT"],"otherNames":["Home-based bilateral arm training (BAT)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home-based TR","description":"home-based traditional rehabilitation:OT or PT or therapist-based training","armGroupLabels":["Home-based TR"],"otherNames":["Home-based traditional rehabilitation (TR)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"kinematic analysis","timeFrame":"2008-2011"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"clinical measures","timeFrame":"2008-2011"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* the onset duration more than 6 months\n* Brunnstrom stage III above for the proximal part and distal part of UL\n* no serious cognitive deficits\n* no balance problems sufficient to compromise safety when wearing the project's constraint device\n* no excessive spasticity in any of the joints of the affected UL exclusion criteria:\n* a score of less than 24 on the Mini Mental State Exam","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ching-yi Wu, ScD","affiliation":"Department of Occupational Therapy, Chang Gung Univ","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital","city":"Kwei-shan","state":"Toayuan","country":"Taiwan"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20848369","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Lin KC, Chuang LL, Wu CY, Hsieh YW, Chang WY.
