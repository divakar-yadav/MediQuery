Therefore, understanding the impact of glycemic fluctuations on diabetic macroangiopathy could be helpful for discovering a strategy of prevention and treatment of macroangiopathy in diabetes. However, previous studies on the glycemic fluctuation in T2DM patients with CI were cross-sectional studies, there has been no prospective intervention study confirming the effects of glucose fluctuation targeted management on the prognosis of T2DM patients following CI. Based on previous fingdings, investigators will assess the effects of glucose fluctuation targeted intervention on metabolic index, neurologic function, and quality of life in T2DM patients and CI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes and Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["Type 2 diabetes","Cerebral infarction","Glucose fluctuation targeted intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"During hospitalization:\n\n1.
