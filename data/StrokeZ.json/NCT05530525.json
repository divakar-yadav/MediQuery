The medical record will be reviewed by an experienced and well-trained occupational therapist.","detailedDescription":"The investigators anticipate reviewing 1000 stroke patients' medical record (from 2018/6/1 to 2021/6/30) from a medical center in Taiwan. The medical record will be reviewed by an experienced and well-trained occupational therapist. The study was approved by the local institutional review board. Because the targeted populations for examining the test-retest reliability and responsiveness were different, the inclusion criteria were listed separately below.\n\nTest-retest reliability Chronic stroke patients' data was reviewed to examine the test-retest reliability. The participants met the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction, (2) age ≥ 20 years, and (3) stroke onset ≥ 6 months (first and recurrent stroke included).\n\nResponsiveness Subacute stroke patients' data was reviewed to examine the responsiveness. The participants met the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction, (2) age ≥ 20 years, and (3) stroke onset \\< 3 months (first and recurrent stroke included)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Test-retest reliability and responsiveness group (All of the data was collected from medical record)","description":"All the participants received conventional rehabilitation (e.g., occupational therapy, physical therapy, or speech therapy) or other interventions (e.g., acupuncture).","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: The Computerized Adaptive Testing system of the Functional Assessment of Stroke","Diagnostic Test: The Barthel Index","Diagnostic Test: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"The Computerized Adaptive Testing system of the Functional Assessment of Stroke","description":"The Computerized Adaptive Testing system of the Functional Assessment of Stroke comprises 58 items.
