Test the effect of reducing sedentary behaviour early after stroke on functional mobility and global disability outcomes.\n2. Determine the impact of neuroimaging biomarkers (e.g. leukoaraiosis) on response to rehabilitation.\n3. Explore the predictive value of accelerometry as an adjunct to the subjective modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to assess functional disability after stroke.\n\nExperimental approach/Research Plan/Use of Funds: The investigators aim to recruit 50 participants within 1 week of ischemic stroke onset, aged ≥ 18 years, medically stable as deemed by their physicians, able to walk at least 5 meters with/without gait aid and with ongoing walking or balance goals. Demographic and stroke characteristics, including stroke risk factors, infarct location and volume, leukoaraiosis on routine MRI, and acute stroke treatments (e.g., thrombectomy) will be determined and documented. A battery of impairment, psychosocial, and functional measures, including the mRS and Timed-Up and Go test (primary outcomes) will be completed. Subsequently, participants will be set up to wear activPAL accelerometer, validated in stroke, for 1 week. Following randomization, a sedentary behaviour change intervention will span 6 weeks, with final follow-up assessments at 90 days.","detailedDescription":"Background Prolonged sedentary behaviour is associated with worse functional outcomes poststroke. The effect of reducing sedentary behaviour early after stroke remains unknown. Leukoaraiosis or cerebral white matter disease, recognizable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as areas of hyperintensities, has gained significance as a potential moderator of stroke recovery. No specific rehabilitation intervention has been developed for survivors of stroke with leukoaraiosis.\n\nThe goals of this research project are to:\n\n1. Test the effect of reducing sedentary behaviour early after stroke on functional mobility and global disability outcomes.\n2. Determine the impact of leukoaraiosis on response to poststroke rehabilitation.\n3. Explore the associations of accelerometry metrics with functional mobility and global disability outcomes poststroke.\n\nMethods The investigators aim to recruit 50 participants, within 7 days of ischemic stroke onset, aged ≥ 18 years, medically stable as deemed by physicians, able to walk at least 5 meters with/without gait aid, and ongoing walking goals (walk speed \\<1.0 meter/second). Demographic and stroke characteristics, including stroke risk factors, infarct location and volume, leukoaraiosis on MRI, and acute stroke treatments (e.g. thrombectomy) will be determined and documented. Subsequently, participants will be set up to wear activPAL accelerometer, validated in stroke,5 for one week. Following randomization, a behaviour change intervention will span 6 weeks with final follow-up assessments at 90 days.\n\nPrimary outcomes: modified Rankin Scale and Timed-Up and Go (TUG) score.\n\nPlan for Data Analysis Compositional data analysis and generalized estimating equations with R software will be used to model the effect of reducing sedentary behaviour and impact of leukoaraiosis on response to rehabilitation. The correlation, responsiveness, and predictive value of the activPAL outcomes as adjunct to the mRS and TUG measures will be evaluated using machine learning, logistic regression, and receiver operating curves.\n\nSignificance and Expected Results The first 90 days after stroke represents a critical window of neuroplasticity. Frequent interruptions in sedentary behaviour, using a whole-day approach, may improve function and recovery, especially for poor responders. If the investigators find this rehabilitation approach to be effective for survivors of stroke with leukoaraiosis, then it could be useful for improving decision-making. Accelerometry as an adjunct to the MRS will increase the granularity of outcome measurement poststroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Movement
