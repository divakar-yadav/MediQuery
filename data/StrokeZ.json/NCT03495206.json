The secondary objective is to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of Y-2 sublingual tablets in healthy male and female adult subjects.","detailedDescription":"This study will be a single-center, single ascending dose study in healthy male and female subjects. A total of 24 subjects, 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each, will be enrolled in this study. All of the 6 subjects in each cohort will receive a single dose of Y-2 sublingual tablet on a single occasion. Prior to taking the drug and after taking the drug at 5 min to 24 h, venous blood from all subjects will be collected at different time points for PK analysis. After dosing, safety and tolerability data for each cohort will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Intracranial Hemorrhages"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Y-2(Edaravone And Borneol) sublingual tablet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Y-2(Edaravone And Borneol) Sublingual Tablet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Y-2(Edaravone And Borneol) Sublingual Tablet","description":"Y-2 sublingual tablet at single ascending doses of one tablet , two tablets, three tablets, four tablets","armGroupLabels":["Y-2(Edaravone And Borneol) sublingual tablet"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants who experience treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)","description":"Any untoward medical events during this study were categorized as severe, moderate, or mild, and related or not related to study treatment","timeFrame":"0 hours to 36 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax]","description":"To evaluate Maximum Plasma Concentration \\[Cmax\\] of Y-2 in patients tested","timeFrame":"0 hours to 24 hours"},{"measure":"Time of Observed Cmax[tmax]","description":"To evaluate Time of Observed Cmax\\[tmax\\] of Y-2 in patients tested","timeFrame":"0 hours to 24 hours"},{"measure":"Area Under the concentration-time Curve from time zero to the last detectable concentration[AUC0-t]","description":"To evaluate Area Under the concentration-time Curve from time zero to the last detectable concentration\\[AUC0-t\\] of Y-2 in patients tested","timeFrame":"0 hours to 24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy adult male and female subjects, 18-55 years of age, Body weight â‰¥ 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 - 30 kg/m2;\n* Women of childbearing potential with a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and check-in, who are not breastfeeding, do not plan to become pregnant during the study, and agree to use an approved alternative method of family planning during the study;\n* Male subjects must agree to use barrier contraception (condom with spermicide) in addition to having their female partner (if of child-bearing potential) use another acceptable form of contraception (IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, or subdermal hormonal implant) from first dose until 30 days following the last administration of study drug;\n* Female subjects, if of child-bearing potential, must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception (IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, or subdermal hormonal implant) in addition to having their male partner use barrier contraception (condom with spermicide) from first dose until 30 days following the last administration of study drug.
