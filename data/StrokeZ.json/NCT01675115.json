The efficacy assessment will be based on the functional outcome while the safety will be reviewed by the adverse events and laboratory examinations.","detailedDescription":"The primary endpoint will be performed on the 12 weeks after study drug administered and will compare the favorable rate between treatment with Aspirin alone and combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin in patients with ischemic stroke. The favorable to therapy will be determined if all of the following occurs: alive, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) \\< 3, Barthel Index (BI) \\>= 60.\n\nSecondary objectives are to compare the following:\n\n1. Compare the favorable rate at one week after study drug administered and the end of treatment (Week 4) and 4 weeks of follow-up (Week 8) of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.\n2. Compare the mean change in Barthel Index (BI), at each evaluation time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.\n3. Compare the mean change in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at each evaluation time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.\n4. Compare the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) at each evaluation time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.\n5. Compare the change in Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at each evaluation time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Traditional Chinese Medication","Aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":129,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BNG-1 plus Aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"BNG-1 3 grams TID plus Aspirin 100mg QD for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: BNG-1"]},{"label":"Aspirin","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Aspirin 100mg QD for 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"BNG-1","description":"BNG-1 3 grams TID for 4 weeks","armGroupLabels":["BNG-1 plus Aspirin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"Aspirin 100 mg QD for 4 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Favorable rate","description":"Favorite rate: A composite of mortality (alive), modified Rankin Scale \\< 3, AND Barthel Index (BI)\\>=60","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Favorable rate","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Barthel index","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
