This was defined as CEA within a period of 4 weeks prior to CABG.\n\nWe retrospectively looked at those patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had CEA performed either under LA (Group A) or under GA (Group B). We measured the 30 days' postoperative stroke rate as the main outcome. We also looked at the rate of intraoperative stroke.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the rate for developing nerve injuries and/or hematoma postoperatively. Finally, we examined the risk for developing postoperative stroke in patients with bilateral significant carotid artery disease that underwent surgery in one side."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Coronary Artery
