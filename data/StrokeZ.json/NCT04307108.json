Before we introduce this technology we need to test that it will work alongside current health services for stroke survivors. Aims: To find out if using the MAGIC-GLASS solution alongside current healthcare care is usable and acceptable to stroke survivors and helps to increase rehabilitation time. Design: Measures before and after stroke survivors use the MAGIC-GLASS solution.\n\nSetting: Stroke survivors will use the MAGIC-GLASS solution in their own home. Population: adults (≥18 years) who have had a stroke at least two weeks before they enter into the study.\n\nInterventions: Our VR technology is called MAGIC-GLASS, and in order to use the solution the user puts on a headset which is connected to a computer. They can then see a VR environment in which they will be able to see virtual hands that respond to the movements of their own hands. It will also be possible to see a mirror image of their hands moving. The system will record how much they use the system and improvement in their movement. Regular contact will be made with a clinician who will be able to use the system to see (from their clinic) how the stroke survivor is doing and talk to them. Outcomes: We want to find out how the stroke survivors' movement changes over time and what they think of using the system. We will also ask clinical staff what they thought of using the system as part of healthcare provision to stroke survivors. Finally we want to find out how much it will cost to use the system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, virtual reality, upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magic Glass","description":"MAGIC-GLASS is a VR-based home system for stroke rehabilitation, developed by Ulster University (UK) in collaboration with Tech4Care srl (Italy) and miThings AB (Sweden) in the context of the EU-funded Project Magic (grant agreement No 687228).
