Stroke is the second or third largest cause of mortality in adults, as well as one of the primary causes of adult disability. Because the majority of stroke patients survive the initial illness, the long-term impacts on patients and their families have the greatest influence on health. Kinesiotaping is a revolutionary rehabilitation procedure. It's most typically used to treat sports injuries, however, it is progressively becoming effective in overcoming other abnormalities. Kinesio Tex tape brand is a flexible, thin, porous cotton fabric with an adhesive backing manufactured by Dr. Kenzo Kase. It provides cutaneous stimulation which facilitates or limit movement, aids in the reduction of edema, reduces pain and correct joint positions for easing muscle spasms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"(Kinesiotaping and motor relearning program group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will receive kinesiotaping; Instructions before applying kinesiotape\n\n* Patients' skin must be clean, free of dirt, oil or sweat.\n* Long hair must be removed for proper adhesion to the skin.\n* Leave the tape upstretched 2-3 cm at start and end point of tape over the skin","interventionNames":["Other: kinesiotaping"]},{"label":"motor relearning program group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will receive motor relearning programme exercises for 40 minutes.\n\n1.
