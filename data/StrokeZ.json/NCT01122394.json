However, many patients have difficulty following treatment recommendations for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the effect of 2 booster sessions of an educational counseling intervention on how well adults who have already participated in a 6-month clinical trial had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are able to follow a treatment plan and control their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. We will also examine how effective this intervention is in improving adherence to diet, medication, and physical activity recommendations for adults who have had a prior stroke or TIA.","detailedDescription":"National recommendations state that patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke should receive hypertension treatment, including antihypertensive medication and lifestyle modification, with a goal of reducing blood pressure (BP) to \\<120 mm Hg systolic BP and \\<80 mm Hg diastolic BP. Statin treatment and lifestyle modification is also recommended for post-stroke and post-TIA patients with elevated cholesterol levels or a history of stroke or TIA with an atherosclerotic cause. Despite the clear benefits of secondary stroke prevention, there is a gap between evidence and implementation in clinical practice. We will determine whether a telephone-delivered behaviorally tailored intervention (TI) can lead to sustained change resulting in (a) BP and lipid control and (b) improved adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA compared to an attention placebo (AP) in veterans who have completed 6 months of a clinical trial. In this CDA project, we evaluate the long-term effectiveness of booster sessions in a randomized manner. One arm will receive 6 months of a tailored intervention (TI) followed by two booster TI sessions at 8 and 10 months, and one arm will receive 6 months of an attention placebo (AP) followed by two booster AP sessions at 8 and 10 months. BP (3 measures taken at least 5 min apart) and dietary sodium are the primary outcomes, while secondary outcomes will be total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio, adherence to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and exercise adherence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","TIA","Hypertension","Hyperlipidemia"],"keywords":["stroke","recurrence","blood pressure","prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tailored Intervention (TI)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tailored intervention based on the transtheoretical model","interventionNames":["Behavioral: TI"]},{"label":"Attention Placebo (AP)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Attention Placebo","interventionNames":["Behavioral: AP"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"TI","description":"Tailored intervention based on the transtheoretical model","armGroupLabels":["Tailored Intervention (TI)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"AP","description":"Attention placebo","armGroupLabels":["Attention Placebo (AP)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Systolic Blood Pressure","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dietary Sodium","description":"self-reported stage of change for adherence to DASH (low-sodium) diet.
