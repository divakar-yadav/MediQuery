Both groups will participate in an exercise program, but only one group (the intervention group) will receive the Axem Home prototype device.\n\nStudy participants will be evaluated at baseline, after 3 weeks, and after 6 weeks (upon the completion of their time in the Early Supported Discharge program). Evaluators will be blinded as to which group participants are in. The study is constructed with randomization to remove selection and allocation biases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Neurofeedback","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy","Neuroergonomics","Motor cortex","Gamification"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Participants will attend 3 assessment sessions: one at the beginning of the study, one after about 3 weeks, and one at the end of the study.

Sub-scales include: upper extremity (0-36), wrist (0-10), hand (0-14), coordination/speed (0-6) (which can be combined to form a total motor function score out of 66), and sensation (0-4).

The ARAT consists of 4 sub-tests; that examines and individual's grip, grasp, pinch and gross motor movement in order to determine upper extremity function. Objects of varying size, shape, and weight must be either grasped, handled or moved in a specific task in order to evaluate function.

An extra question asks that the patient rate on a scale from 0 - 100 how much they feel that he/she has recovered from his/her stroke. The 4 physical domains (strength, hand function, mobility and activities of daily living) can be summed together to create a single, physical dimension score (28-140) while all other domains should remain separate.
