Patients are followed up one and three days after treatment, at 3 months and by a telephone interview at 12 months.","detailedDescription":"Patients had a more than 50% carotid artery stenosis according to ECST and suffered from ischemic stroke, transitory ischemic attack or intermittent blindness (amaurosis fugax) within the last 30 days. All patients were on standard medication with aspirin or clopidogrel and received heparin for thrombosis prophylaxis. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid stenting (CAS) or best medical therapy for treatment of the carotid stenosis and prevention of secondary thrombo-emboli was performed according to guidelines. Additional treatment with Revacept or placebo was done on top of the standard therapy. Therefore the control group receiving placebo was already on the standard medical therapy for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and received also the guideline conform interventions CEA, CAS or best medical therapy.\n\nSecondary prophylaxis of thrombo-embolic ischemic events by Revacept should be investigated. Therefore microemboli were detected by transcranial Doppler and ischemic brain lesions were investigated by diffusion weighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) scan as exploratory endpoints. Moreover clinical endpoints such as stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, coronary intervention and death were investigated at 1 week, 3 months and 12 months follow-up. Safety was closely monitored with emphasis on bleeding complications as bleeding is the most dreaded complication of anti-thrombotic agents especially in patients with cerebral strokes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Stenosis","Atherosclerosis","Stroke","Transient-ischaemic Attack","TIA","Amaurosis Fugax"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":158,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 1% sucrose, 4% mannitol","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo control with PBS, 1% sucrose and 4% mannitol","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"40 mg Revacept","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"low dose Revacept 40mg in PBS, 1% sucrose, 4% mannitol","interventionNames":["Drug: Revacept"]},{"label":"120 mg Revacept","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"high dose revacept 120mg in PBS, 1% sucrose, 4% mannitol","interventionNames":["Drug: Revacept"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Revacept","description":"single intravenous injection","armGroupLabels":["120 mg Revacept","40 mg Revacept"],"otherNames":["40 mg or 120 mg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"single intravenous injection","armGroupLabels":["Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 1% sucrose, 4% mannitol"],"otherNames":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"New DWI Lesion(s)","description":"The number of new diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) lesion(s) reported.

Therefore MES incidence was a key inclusion criteria at screening. Due to low incidence of MES in this patient population with high screening failure rate the mandatory presence of MES was abandoned during the course of the study.
