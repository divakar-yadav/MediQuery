Allocation at each center will account for 1 stratum: use of alteplase (yes vs. no) before MT. Subjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization.","detailedDescription":"The study objective is to evaluate whether rt-PA is safe and efficient as an add-on to mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke and complete or near-complete recanalization of a proximal vessel occlusion and successful brain reperfusion on cerebral angiogram (corresponding to mTICI score 2b/3) The study is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, phase 2b trial of acute stroke patients treated with MT, in which two therapies are compared: rt-PA or placebo. Allocation at each center will account for 1 stratum: use of alteplase (yes vs. no) before MT. Subjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization\n\nPatients will be enrolled in the angiosuit by interventionalists or neurologists once a mTICI 2b/3 is confirmed on cerebral angiography. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with a mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days. A sample size of 100 patients per treatment arm in a 1:1 allocation will have at least 80% statistical power for the primary outcome (mRS with 0-1 score values) assuming a rate of 40% in the control arm and a 21% benefit in the experimental arm (odds ratio (OR) of 2.33) for a 5% two-sided type I error. This sample size will also guarantee the study power for that relative treatment benefit even if the success rate in the control group rises up to ≈56%. No study losses are accounted for since all randomised patients will be included in the analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Mechanical Thrombectomy","Recanalization","Reperfusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, phase 2b trial of acute stroke patients treated with MT, in which two therapies are compared: rt-PA or placebo.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The solutions of alteplase or placebo are limpid, transparent and colorless.
