Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\n\nSleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive and central sleep apnea, often coexist with stroke. Compared to the general population, in whom OSA is the most common form of this breathing disorder with recent prevalence estimates of 22% of male and 17% of female , in the stroke population, the prevalence of OSA is much greater at 70% . Several randomized controlledtrials on OSA patients with stroke in acute or sub-acute stage showed that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improved motor and functional outcomes, accelerated neurological recovery.Apart from the benefits in better neurological outcomes, secondary analyses of SAVE study suggested that CPAP treatment potentially help to reduce recurrence of stroke. Nevertheless, we don't have evidence yet from randomized control studies to prove CPAP treatment would reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.\n\nTraditionally, recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events uses documented mortality, morbidity or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or stroke as clinical endpoints. Recently, several studies showed that enlarged left atrium (LA) can serve as a predictor for recurrent stroke or cardiovascular events. On the other hand, a growing body of studies demonstrated that CPAP treatment reduce size of LA in those with OSA. Notably, all of these studies above are observational or retrospective in nature. To date, there are no prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on the change of size of LA. We therefore will undertake a randomized , controlled trial involving patients with stroke to test the primary hypothesis that treatment of OSA with CPAP would reduce the size of LA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Obstructive Sleep Apnea"],"keywords":["obstructive sleep apnea","stroke","continuous positive airway pressure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CPAP group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will receive CPAP treatment in addition to optimal standard therapy for acute stroke.","interventionNames":["Device: CPAP"]},{"label":"Usual-care group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects will receive optimal standard therapy for acute stroke."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"CPAP","description":"CPAP will be given after obstructive sleep apnea being diagnosed in the acute stage of stroke.","armGroupLabels":["CPAP group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in left atrium volume index (LAVI)","description":"Change of LAVI will be assessed by transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serial change of NT-proBNP","description":"Change of NT-proBNP will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Neurological and functional assessments-1","description":"Change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) stoke scale will be assessed at baseline ,3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Neurological and functional assessments-2","description":"Change in modified Rankin scale will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Neurological and functional assessments-3","description":"Chang in Barthel-ADL index will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Quality of life assessments","description":"Change in Epworth sleepiness scale and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numbers of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events","description":"Numbers of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events post randomization","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Time to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events","description":"Time to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events post randomization","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Numbers of all-cause hospitalizations","description":"Numbers of hospitalizations for any reason post randomization","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Number of deaths","description":"Numbers of deaths from all causes post randomization","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Time to deaths","description":"Time to deaths from all causes post randomization","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
