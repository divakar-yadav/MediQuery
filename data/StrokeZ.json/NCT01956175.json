In case a patient cannot be decannulated at that time point, there is an open-label follow-up treatment phase, in which every patient in the sham treatment arm gets another three days of real electrical pharyngeal stimulation to not deprive any patient of a potentially beneficial treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["electrical pharyngeal stimulation","stroke-related dysphagia","tracheostomy","decannulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Electrical pharyngeal stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Electrical pharyngeal stimulation once daily for 10 minutes on three consecutive days.","interventionNames":["Device: Electrical pharyngeal stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham stimulation once daily for 10 minutes on three consecutive days.
