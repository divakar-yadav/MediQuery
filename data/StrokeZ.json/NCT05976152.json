Due to the early recovery of conditions such as delirium and transient cognitive impairment after stroke, the diagnosis of PSCI often requires cognitive assessment at 3 to 6 months post-stroke to determine the severity of cognitive impairment. It can be classified according to the severity of cognitive impairment as post-stroke cognitive impairment no dementia (PSCIND) and post-stroke dementia (PSD). Recent large international cohort studies have reported an incidence rate of PSCI ranging from 24% to 53.4%, and patients with PSCI have a significantly higher mortality rate compared to those without cognitive impairment. Guidelines such as American Heart Association/American Society of Anesthesiologists (AHA/ASA) and the Chinese \"Expert Consensus on the Management of Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment\" propose integrating cognitive impairment and stroke intervention strategies. Early comprehensive intervention and treatment for high-risk individuals after stroke, aiming to delay or prevent the progression from PSCIND to PSD, are the primary goals in the current treatment of PSCI. However, there is currently a lack of large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for PSCI, and research is still needed to determine whether cognitive-enhancing drugs can reduce the risk of PSCI occurrence and improve outcomes and prognosis for PSCI patients. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical study involving 281 non-dementia vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) patients showed that the overall cognitive scores of patients treated with donepezil for 6 months significantly improved compared to the placebo group.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of post-stroke cognitive impairment. It will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 48-week treatment duration. The study will observe the difference in PSCI incidence rate between the donepezil treatment group and the conventional stroke treatment group at 24 weeks and evaluate the improvement in post-stroke cognitive impairment after 6 months of donepezil treatment compared to conventional treatment.\n\nThis study will be conducted in two stages: the first stage (0-6 months) aims to assess whether donepezil can reduce the risk of PSCI occurrence and will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The second stage (7-12 months) aims to evaluate whether donepezil can improve the prognosis of PSCI patients and will also be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment (PSCI)"],"keywords":["stroke","PSCI","Butylphthalide"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"dl-3-butylphthalide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Routine treatment and dl-3-butylphthalide","interventionNames":["Drug: dl-3-butylphthalide","Drug: dl-3-butylphthalide placebo"]},{"label":"dl-3-butylphthalide Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Routine treatment and dl-3-butylphthalide Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: dl-3-butylphthalide","Drug: dl-3-butylphthalide placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"dl-3-butylphthalide","description":"First stage： Routine stroke treatment: hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, antiplatelet, anticoagulant and other conventional cerebrovascular disease treatment drugs.\n\nPlacebo group: routine stroke treatment + oral Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules, 2 capsules/time, tid, an empty stomach for 6 months.\n\nButylphthalide group: routine stroke treatment + oral Butylphthalide Soft Capsules, 2 capsules/time, tid, an empty stomach for 6 months.\n\nSecond stage： 14d washout period after first stage.
