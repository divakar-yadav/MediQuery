Reliability of several invasive measurements used for this purpose for many years have been questioned recently. The study will evaluate consistency between carotid artery flow derivatives and standard haemodynamic measurement (LIDCO rapid) in navigation of intraoperative fluid therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anesthesia","Fluid Responsiveness"],"keywords":["Fluid Responsiveness, Anesthesia, Surgery, Stroke Volume Variation, Fluid status,"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"All patients included in the study will receive 4 ml/kg fluid bolus.","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fluid bolus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients included in the study will receive fluid bolus.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Fluid bolus"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Fluid bolus","description":"All patients included in the study will receive 5 ml/kg fluid bolus of a balanced crystalloid solution.","armGroupLabels":["Fluid bolus"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in cardiac output","description":"A measure of change of scaled cardiac output (nCO) with LiDCO device","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in a corrected carotid artery flow","description":"Ultrasound measure of corrected carotid artery flow time","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in pulse pressure variation","description":"A measure of change of pulse pressure variation (PPV) with LiDCO device","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in stroke volume variation","description":"A measure of change of pulse pressure variation with LiDCO device","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in a carotid blood flow","description":"Ultrasound measure of corrected carotid blood flow time","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in a velocity time integral of carotid flow","description":"Ultrasound measure of velocity time integral of carotid flow","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in the maximal systolic carotid velocity variation","description":"Ultrasound measure of the maximal systolic carotid velocity variation","timeFrame":"Before and 2 minutes after intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Major abdominal surgery\n* Artery catheter required\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Laparoscopic surgery\n* Known history of carotid endarterectomy\n* Known history of carotid stenosis\n* Non-sinus rhythm\n* Systolic or diastolic heart failure\n* Chronic kidney disease\n* Pulmonary hypertension\n* Carotid artery anomaly\n* Unable to visualise carotid artery\n* Angle of correction \\> 60","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Medical University Of Warsaw","city":"Warsaw","state":"Mazovian","zip":"02-091","country":"Poland","geoPoint":{"lat":52.22977,"lon":21.01178}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M3797","name":"Anesthetics","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21550","name":"Pharmaceutical Solutions","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"PhSol","name":"Pharmaceutical Solutions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
