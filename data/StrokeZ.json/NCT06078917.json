Patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by anterior circulation intracranial large vessel occlusion and receiving EVT were included. Patients were divided into primary stroke center (county hospital) and senior stroke center (city hospital) groups. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) workflow, EVT procedural details and clinical outcome were compared in two groups. The aim of the study was to explore the EVT difference in Chinese city and county hospital."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endovascular Treatment"],"keywords":["Endovascular Treatment","acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1196,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days","description":"The range of the modified Rankin Scale is from 0 to 6.
