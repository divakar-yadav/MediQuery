Additionally, patients will be contacted by study personnel approximately 3 to 5-days and 30-days post-infusion for completion of Modified Rankin Scale stroke disability survey as follow up of stroke recovery.\n\nSetting\n\nMedical and surgical intensive care units at Mayo Clinic Florida.\n\nPatients\n\nAll patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) infusion, survive to discharge from the hospital, are hemodynamically stable, and are mobilized by physical and/or occupational therapy within 24 hours post-tPA infusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","tissue plasminogen activator","early mobilization","patient safety","length of
