The linkage of smart phone use to function and quality of life will be assessed with standardized outcome measures at defined time points.","detailedDescription":"People with stroke are among the most relevant target groups for unobtrusive monitoring. Worldwide, stroke is the second most frequent cause for lasting disability and causes a substantial burden for the individual, caregivers and society. Thanks to improved treatment, many stroke survivors can be discharged to their homes. However, many have to live with disabilities and are prone to declining function, cognitive impairment and depression. With the acquired data, we want to create a database where digital behavior is analyzed with advanced computational methods. In collaboration with the Department of Cognitive Psychology, University of Leiden, Netherlands, these data will be used to discover specific features for different health issues and to develop tools for the early detection of functional decline for different populations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke, digital behavior, health-related quality of life, cognitive function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention or exposure","description":"No intervention or exposure"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Different parameters of digital behavior","description":"Number of interactions with the smart phone, tapping speed, typing speed, social media use","timeFrame":"Continuously throughout the 90 days of monitoring"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EQ5D","description":"Health related quality of life, 5 point subscale, Index values of 0-1 (better), EQ5D VAS 0-100 (better)","timeFrame":"Once a week during 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Mini MoCA","description":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment, cognitive function, scale 0-15 (better)","timeFrame":"3 times in three months, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"SF-36","description":"Health related quality of life, 0-100 (better)","timeFrame":"3 times in three months, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Stroke Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire - short version","description":"Stroke related quality of life, 12-60 (better)","timeFrame":"3 times in three months, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Health today","description":"One question about subjective health, VAS 0-100 (better)","timeFrame":"Every day throughout 90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* New or recurrent stroke, admitted to rehabilitation, discharge to own home\n* Owns an Android smart phone\n* Smart phone is used by the patient only\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe cognitive impairments and / or psychiatric and behavioral conditions that interfere with compliance.\n* Not able to provide informed consent\n* Discharge to nursing homes or other care facilities","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We want to include a broad range of patients with stroke, incuding both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes and different impairments due to stroke.
