Primary measures are function and strength. Secondary measures will evaluate muscle tone, flexibility, and the subject's perception of their everyday function and improvement. Research Hypothesis: For chronic upper limb hemiparesis secondary to stroke, four weeks of mirror-box training with movement of the unaffected limb only results in a mean increase of 10 points on the Fugl-Meyer Test of Motor Recovery (Upper Extremity).","detailedDescription":"Due to the relatively new nature of mirror training, there are few randomized controlled studies. This pilot case series will serve as our initial step in trying to identify the frequency, duration, and treatment exercises needed in this population. Additionally, this pilot will allow us to ensure our outcome measures are appropriate to detect meaningful treatment changes. After obtaining informed consent, patients will undergo two separate baseline assessments of strength, function, and tone 4 weeks apart. Training sessions will consist of supervised activities using the unaffected arm while observing its mirror reflection; the affected arm will remain still. Sessions will be one hour a day, five days a week, for four weeks. Patients will be tested for strength, function and tone in the affected arm at completion of the four week treatment period by the same occupational therapist that performed the pretests."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["mirror training","stroke","hemiparesis","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror training","type":"OTHER","description":"Training will be performed one-on-one by an investigator in a quiet room, one hour a day, five days a week, for four weeks.
