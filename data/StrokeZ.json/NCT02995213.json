The objectives of this pilot study are to:\n\ni.) determine the feasibility of using accelerometers to quantify amount of UE use in the home setting in individuals chronic post-stroke,\n\nii.) quantify and compare the unilateral activity of the weaker (paretic) versus stronger (non-paretic) UEs, and\n\niii.) assess the effect of a 7 sessions of in-home accelerometer used-based feedback on unilateral and bilateral UE use.\n\niv.) assess kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data during UE movements unilaterally and bilaterally in subjects post-chronic stroke pre and post feedback."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Feedback Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Accelerometer based feedback about paretic arm use"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Accelerometer based feedback about paretic arm use","armGroupLabels":["Feedback Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accelerometer based paretic arm amount of use","timeFrame":"3 week period"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects post-stroke\n* chronic post ischemic or hemorrhagic cortical or subcortical stroke\n* 25 - 100 years old\n* upper extremity impairment\n* Subjects will need to be able to flex their paretic shoulder and their elbow \\> 40Â° without assist\n* able to follow 2-step commands\n* community dwelling with or without assistance\n* intact superficial light touch sensation in both upper extremities\n* must also have some movement in both arms\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* can't currently have another neuromuscular disorders such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis\n* no upper extremity injury within the last 3 months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
