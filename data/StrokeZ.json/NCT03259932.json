The aim of this study is to show that the implementation of a personalised physical activity programme, starting 1 month after the hospitalisation for minor stroke, significantly decreases the frequency of fatigue in these patients, in comparison with usual management \"in real life\".."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"usual management","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: no physical activity"]},{"label":"physical training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: physical activity"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"no physical activity","description":"no physical activity","armGroupLabels":["usual management"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"physical activity","description":"Rehabilitation program will start 4 weeks after discharge from acute care (S4), for a duration of 8 weeks (3 sessions / week).
