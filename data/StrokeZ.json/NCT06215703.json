The music task consists of tapping an MRI-compatible MIDI drum with either: (1) improvisation or maintaining the beat and (2) live or recorded piano accompaniment. The primary objectives are to identify the motor, affective, and neural outcomes of improvisation and live accompaniment in music playing tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","healthy","music","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"A 2x2 crossover design will be used such that each participant will complete all music playing conditions, including: (1) with or without improvisation and (2) with or without live accompaniment.
