The impression is more frequent measurements of blood pressure, serum glucose, troponin and supplementary computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.","detailedDescription":"There is in general a focus on misuse of health resources. An increasing amount of guidelines is produced to reduce the variation in treatment of patients with the same diagnosis. Many recommendations are weak but seems though to have considerable impact on in hospital care. The issues to be studied are all grounded on weak clinical evidence. A pilot study confirmed the suspicion of very frequent measurements of blood pressure, glucose, troponin and frequent supplementary CT and MRI. The intention is to study these issues in a larger population including an evaluation of utility of the different examinations and evaluations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Quality of Care","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Hyperglycemia","Hypertension","Troponin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of supplementary computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.","description":"Number","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"The number of blood sugar measurements","description":"Number","timeFrame":"72 hours after admission to hospital"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Troponin measurement,","description":"frequency and level of max value","timeFrame":"72 hours"},{"measure":"Number of blood pressure measurement","description":"Number","timeFrame":"72 hours"},{"measure":"Transfer to tertiary center","description":"Number","timeFrame":"72 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a diagnosis of stroke according to ICD 10th revision (code I61 I63 and I64)\n* Hospitalized between January 1 and December 31, 2015\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous hospitalization with a diagnosis of stroke in 2015.\n* Foreigners and patients from other regions of Norway.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients \\> 18 years, registered with a diagnosis of stroke during 2015 at Innlandet Hospital Trust Lillehammer.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ingebjørg Hartz","affiliation":"Sykehuset Innlandet HF","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Innlandet Hospital Trust Lillehammer","city":"Lillehammer","zip":"2609","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":61.11514,"lon":10.46628}},{"facility":"Ellen Bøhmer","city":"Lillehammer","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":61.11514,"lon":10.46628}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000006943","term":"Hyperglycemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9684","name":"Hyperglycemia","asFound":"Hyperglycemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25093","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
