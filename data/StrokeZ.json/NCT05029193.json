This study aims to determine the extent to which a 3-week online mindfulness intervention will improve quality of life and psychological well-being for chronic stroke survivors and their caregivers, compared to a waitlist control.","detailedDescription":"Background: The incidence of depression and anxiety is much higher in stroke survivors and their caregivers compared to age-matched peers. Previous work suggests that mindfulness delivered in an online format is promising for both individuals with neurological disorders and caregivers to improve quality of life and psychological well-being.\n\nAim: This project aims to determine the extent to which a 3-week online mindfulness intervention will improve quality of life and psychological well-being for chronic stroke survivors and their caregivers, compared to a waitlist control. The primary hypothesis is that participants in the mindfulness group will demonstrate greater improvement in quality of life and psychological well-being post-intervention compared to waitlist control participants. The secondary hypothesis is that these improvements will persist for at least 1-month post-intervention.\n\nMethods: This project uses a pragmatic, randomized, waitlist-control trial design with blinded outcome assessment. Participants (stroke survivors and caregivers) are assigned to a 3-week online mindfulness intervention, or a 2-month delayed waitlist. A battery of self-reported outcome measures and clinical tests are administered pre-intervention, post-intervention and at 1-month follow-up. Participants in the waitlist control group are also assessed at enrollment. A sample of 44 stroke survivors and 44 caregivers is targeted. Changes will be measured using a repeated analysis of variance.\n\nConclusion: The study constitutes the initial step to understand the role of mindfulness exercises delivered remotely and the potential benefit of the intervention for stroke survivors across a wide range of disability level and their caregivers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Caregiver Burnout"],"keywords":["mindfulness","rehabilitation","caregiver","attention to variability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomly assigned to a mindfulness intervention or a waitlist control.

The purpose of the intervention is: 1) to increase participants' mindfulness, and 2) to encourage participants to change their beliefs about the disability associated with stroke to improve their psychological state. Mindfulness refers to the act of being aware: aware of thoughts, aware of emotions, aware of physical sensations, aware of others. The intervention consists of educational texts, daily exercises, audio recordings and videos. Five different topics related to mindfulness will be introduced throughout the intervention.","armGroupLabels":["Caregivers - Mindfulness intervention","Stroke survivors - Mindfulness intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)","description":"The HADS assesses depression and anxiety.
