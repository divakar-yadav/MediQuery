A randomised blinded controlled pilot trial will be conducted. Twenty people with stroke will be randomly allocated to 4-weeks of SURE program or education program. This is to perform on top of their usual care. To determine the clinical benefit, all participants will be assessed pre-, 2 weeks during the training, post-training, 1-month and 3-month follow-up using a range of impairment and activity measures. To determine the cortical activation (fMRI), structural (FLAIR and DTI) and functional (resting state fcMRI) connectivity of cortical motor regions, all participants will undergo a 3T MRI pre-, post- and post-3 months after training.","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nUL recovery after stroke has been found to be limited. Efforts should be channelled into rehabilitation to improve UL recovery after stroke. First 4-weeks post-stroke is the period when neuroplasticity unfolds and when most rehabilitation occurs. This critical time window should be capitalized to interact with spontaneous biological recovery to facilitate UL recovery. There is growing evidence that shows that early increased UL practice after stroke improves the recovery of upper limb function. However, it has also been found that the level of early UL practice and use during early post-stroke is low. SURE program is a self-exercise program which aims to empower people with stroke and their caregivers to increase early UL practice outside therapy.\n\nAim:\n\nTo investigate the effect of SURE program on UL recovery during first few weeks post-stroke.\n\nMethod:\n\nA randomised blinded controlled pilot trial will be conducted. Twenty people with stroke will be randomly allocated to 4-weeks of SURE program or education program.\n\nIntervention Group- SURE Program The intervention group will receive a SURE program booklet and will perform individualized daily self-exercise and functional use of the arm and hand on their own outside of therapy for 60 minutes/day, 6 days/week for 4 weeks. These self-exercises and upper limb functional use will be performed in addition to usual care. Three SURE program booklets have been developed which relate to the affected upper limb motor capability using individual Fugl Meyer (ULFM) score. Each SURE program booklet consists of warm-up exercises, strengthening exercises and motor tasks. The SURE program booklet also includes selected functional motor tasks to be performed by the participants using their affected upper limb. The performance of the exercises and functional motor tasks will be reviewed three times per week for the first 2 weeks, two times for the third week and one time for the fourth week of intervention period.\n\nControl Group- Education The control group will receive an education booklet with 10 modules. The education booklet will contain information on stroke, recovery and management strategies after stroke. Participants are to complete 2-3 modules per week and answer 1-2 simple questions after each module. Each module including answering questions takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. CPI will review the information with the participants 3 times per week for the first 2 weeks, two times for the third week and one time for the fourth week of intervention period.The participants in the control group will continue with their usual care in the hospital.\n\nTo determine the clinical benefit, all participants will be assessed pre-, 2 weeks during the training, post-training, 1-month and 3-month follow-up using a range of impairment and activity measures. To determine the cortical activation (fMRI), structural (FLAIR and DTI) and functional (resting state fcMRI) connectivity of cortical motor regions, all participants will undergo a 3T MRI pre-, post- and post-3 months after training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper Limb","Self-exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised Blinded Controlled Pilot Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The outcome assessor will be blinded to which group the participants are in","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SURE Program Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will receive a SURE program booklet and will perform individualized daily self-exercise and functional use of the arm and hand on their own outside of therapy for 60 minutes/day, 6 days/week for 4 weeks.
