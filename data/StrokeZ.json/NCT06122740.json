The MAM-36 scale was translated into Turkish by two experienced physiotherapists who are native Turkish speakers and have a good command of English, following the translation procedures. The two translations were compared with each other and a single Turkish draft was created. This draft was translated back into English by two translators who are native English speakers and have a good command of Turkish. The two back translations were compared to each other and converted into a single form. The resulting form was compared with the original form and the final back-translation scale was created. All translation formats of the scale were examined in detail by those who translated the scale into Turkish and a jury consisting of experienced physiotherapists. At the end of the meeting, the pilot study form of the scale was created. The created draft was applied to 30 healthy individuals as a pilot study. The final version of the scale was created by evaluating the feedback obtained. The clinical phase of the study was carried out on 250 volunteer individuals who applied to Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Hospital Neurology Department Polyclinics and were diagnosed with MS, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, and who had various degrees of problems in hand dexterity and functions due to their diseases. To evaluate the validity of MAM-36, Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH), which can measure manual dexterity and was validated in Turkish, was used. The scales were repeated 15 days later to assess test-retest reliability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Upper Extremity Problem"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"15 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Turkish Validity and Reliability of The MAM-36 Scale","description":"The aim of this study is to adapt the Manual Ability Measure-36 (MAM-36) scale to Turkish society and to make its validity and reliability in Turkish."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Manual Ability Measure-36","description":"Manual Ability Measure-36 was used to measure hand functions. The scale is a task- and patient-oriented measurement tool. Scale items consist of tasks that are frequently performed in daily life. In the survey where individuals subjectively evaluate their manual skills, a 4-point Likert rating scale is used, where 1 is 'I cannot do', 2 is 'very difficult', 3 is 'somewhat difficult', 4 is 'easy'. As a result of this 4-grade scoring of the scale, each patient receives a score between 0-144 from the test. However, in order to facilitate the analysis of future studies on the scale, a 100-point conversion table was created by the creators of the test.","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand","description":"Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) was developed by the 'Institute of Work and Health Ontario and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons' for use in patients with upper extremity problems. DASH is a self-report scale that measures activity and participation limitations and level of disability in upper extremity disorders. The patient's symptoms and daily life activities are examined on a scale consisting of thirty questions. Grading of the scale is done with a Likert scale. For each task, the patient gives a difficulty rating between 1 and 5. These five difficulty levels are defined as 1: no difficulty, 2: mild difficulty, 3: moderate difficulty, 4: extreme difficulty, 5: not at all. A score between 0-100 (0 = no apology, 100 = maximum apology) is obtained from the scale. A high score also indicates high functional disability. The scale has a Turkish cultural adaptation.","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being diagnosed with a neurological disease (Stroke, Parkinson's or MS)\n* At least one upper extremity is affected\n* Being conscious enough to complete the survey and knowing how to read and write\n* Agreeing to participate in the research\n* Being over 18 years old\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having an upper extremity operation within the last 6 months\n* Having had an attack or seizure in the last month\n* Participating in any physical therapy program during the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Individuals who were diagnosed with stroke, Parkinson's or Multiple Sclerosis and had problems with manual dexterity in at least one upper extremity were included in the study.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010300","term":"Parkinson Disease"},{"id":"D000009103","term":"Multiple Sclerosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020734","term":"Parkinsonian Disorders"},{"id":"D000001480","term":"Basal Ganglia Diseases"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009069","term":"Movement Disorders"},{"id":"D000080874","term":"Synucleinopathies"},{"id":"D000019636","term":"Neurodegenerative Diseases"},{"id":"D000020278","term":"Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases, CNS"},{"id":"D000020274","term":"Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System"},{"id":"D000003711","term":"Demyelinating Diseases"},{"id":"D000001327","term":"Autoimmune Diseases"},{"id":"D000007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12903","name":"Parkinson Disease","asFound":"Parkinson's Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11750","name":"Multiple Sclerosis","asFound":"Multiple Sclerosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15105","name":"Sclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22184","name":"Parkinsonian Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25293","name":"Ganglion Cysts","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16048","name":"Synovial Cyst","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4464","name":"Basal Ganglia Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11719","name":"Movement Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2217","name":"Synucleinopathies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21248","name":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4319","name":"Autoimmune Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21788","name":"Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases, CNS","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21784","name":"Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6599","name":"Demyelinating Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9890","name":"Immune System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
