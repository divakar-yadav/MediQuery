Patients are randomized (1:1:1) to listen instrumental or vocal music, or audiobooks (recorded book reading) (control). Outcome measures are change in neuropsychological tests, change in self-reported mood, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging changes and hormonal changes performed at acute, 3-month and 6-month stages.","detailedDescription":"Please see
