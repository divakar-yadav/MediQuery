Repeated correct movement patterns affect the central nervous system and stimulating its plasticity. Despite the fact that so many studies confirm the validity of therapy using robots, it is still difficult to assess to what extent its use improves the effectiveness of traditional therapy. In these studies, we want to objectively assess the effectiveness of the Luna device using EMG biofeedback."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Luna EMG","drop foot","chronic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A four-week rehabilitation program (Monday to Friday) involving the hour of individual ankle therapy and one hour therapy on the Luna EMG device.","interventionNames":["Device: Luna EMG"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"A four-week rehabilitation program (Monday to Friday) involving two hours of individual ankle therapy."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Luna EMG","description":"The duration of the overall therapeutic intervention in both groups will be the same.","armGroupLabels":["Study Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EMG using the Luna EMG","description":"EMG will be performed using the Luna EMG device also allowing the treatment and diagnosis.

Grade 1: Only a trace or flicker of movement is seen or felt in the muscle or fasciculations are observed in the muscle.\n\nGrade 0: No movement is observed. Higher values represent a better outcome.
