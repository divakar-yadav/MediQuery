Lancet 2011), a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that assessed the effect of fluoxetine vs placebo on motor recovery after ischemic stroke, in an American sample of post-acute stroke patients. This trial will in addition examine the effect of treatment with fluoxetine versus placebo on concurrent deficits in language and hemispatial attention, as well as post-stroke fatigue and will evaluate the durability of observed effects. The results of this pilot trial will be used to develop power estimates for a larger trial and to evaluate recruitment and intervention completion rates for subjects in an American post-acute environment. There are two additional substudies: the first will use MRI to assess structural changes at the beginning and end of the intervention; the second will examine the relationship of serum biomarkers of inflammation to the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","recovery","fluoxetine","aphasia","neglect","motor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fluoxetine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects
