In this sense, the premotor cortex (PMC) can be considered as an alternative locus for post-stroke rehabilitation. In relation to physical rehabilitation protocols, associate to neuromodulation, the investigators have chosen a standardized physical therapy protocol for this study, the Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), which presents evidence of good therapeutic results. The investigators hypothesized that applying tDCS and CIMT over the PMC promotes motor restoration in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active tdcs/M1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anodal tDCS on primary motor cortex and CIMT (constraint induced movement therapy)","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy"]},{"label":"Active tdcs/Premotor","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anodal tDCS on premotor cortex and CIMT (constraint induced movement therapy)","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy"]},{"label":"Sham tdcs","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham tDCS and CIMT (constraint induced movement therapy)","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation","Behavioral: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial direct current stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Active tdcs/M1","Active tdcs/Premotor","Sham tdcs"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Active tdcs/M1","Active tdcs/Premotor","Sham tdcs"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Independence measured by Barthel Index","timeFrame":"Change for functional independence at baseline and week 2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 2"},{"measure":"Muscle strength (Medical Research Council Scale)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 2"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age between 18 and 65 years\n* Diagnosis of unilateral, non-recurring, subacute stroke\n* Participants also had to be able, by using any method of pinch, to grasp a washcloth from a table top, lift it up a few inches, and release it.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with difficulty to follow the procedures or understand the instructions; cognitive deficits\n* tDCS criteria:\n\n  * use of modulators of the Central Nervous System drugs\n  * patients with implanted metallic or electronic devices\n  * pacemaker\n  * seizures\n  * pregnancy\n  * any other condition that might limit or interfere in the sensorimotor system","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Suellen Andrade","city":"João Pessoa","state":"PB","country":"Brazil","geoPoint":{"lat":-7.115,"lon":-34.86306}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Cerebral Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
