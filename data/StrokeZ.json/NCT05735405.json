Does a moderate intensity aerobic exercise, prior to a cognitive training, allow a better performance?\n2. Is it possible to exploit the timing of rehabilitation interventions to obtain greater effects? Participants will be divided in 2 groups. The experimental group will first perform 20 minutes of pedaling as a moderate intensity aerobic exercise. It will then participate in one-hour cognitive training sessions, with the aim of training attentional, working memory and executive functions. The control group will carry out the same interventions but in reverse order.\n\nThe researchers will compare the results of the cognitive training in the two groups to verify if the order of the interventions influences the results themselves."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["BDNF","Aerobic Exercise","Cognitive Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will first perform 30 minutes of pedaling as a moderate intensity aerobic activity.
