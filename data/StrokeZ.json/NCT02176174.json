However, less is known about differences between ethnic groups and a wider range of cardiovascular diseases. This study will examine differences between ethnic groups (White, Black, South Asian and Mixed/Other) and first lifetime presentation of twelve different cardiovascular diseases. This information may help to predict the onset of cardiovascular diseases and inform disease prevention strategies.\n\nThe hypothesis is that different ethnic groups have differing associations with the range of cardiovascular diseases studied.","detailedDescription":"There is evidence from epidemiological studies that different ethnic groups are associated with increased incidence of specific cardiovascular diseases. However, the majority of existing studies have examined associations with one or two acute conditions such as stroke or coronary heart disease or focused on a particular ethnic group.\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the differing associations between four ethnic groups and the initial lifetime presentation of a broad range of cardiovascular diseases, including chronic presentations such as stable angina. The hypothesis is that there will be heterogeneity of associations between the different ethnic groups and the full range of cardiovascular diseases studied.\n\nThe study will use data from the CALIBER data set of clinically collected electronic health record data from England.\n\nThis study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Wellcome Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink - CPRD) and other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER data set)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","Coronary Heart Disease","Sudden Cardiac Death","Intracerebral Haemorrhage","Heart Failure","Ischemic Stroke","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Peripheral Arterial Disease","Stable Angina Pectoris","Subarachnoid Haemorrhage","Transient Ischemic Attack","Unstable Angina","Cardiac Arrest"],"keywords":["Ethnic group","Cardiovascular disease","Atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1068318,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"White","description":"Self-reported ethnic group of Black, using the United Kingdom Census categories, as recorded in electronic health records."},{"label":"Black","description":"Self-reported ethnic group of Black, using the United Kingdom Census categories, as recorded in electronic health records."},{"label":"South Asian","description":"Self-reported ethnic group of South Asian, using the United Kingdom Census categories, as recorded in electronic health records."},{"label":"Mixed/Other","description":"Self-reported ethnic group of Mixed or other, using the United Kingdom Census categories, as recorded in electronic health records."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Initial presentation of cardiovascular disease","description":"First recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease during follow-up: ventricular arrhythmia / sudden cardiac death, heart failure, unheralded coronary death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stable angina, abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack","timeFrame":"10 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"All cause mortality","timeFrame":"10 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients aged 30 and over\n* Registered with a participating general practice during the study period\n* Minimum one year of records prior to study entry meeting CPRD data quality\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients without a record of ethnic group\n* Patients without record of gender\n* Patients with prior atherosclerotic disease, as recorded in primary care or hospitalisation data\n* Pregnant women in the 6 months before the eligibility date","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients in the CALIBER database who have a record of ethnic group while registered at one of 225 general practices contributing data to CPRD (the Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and consenting to data linkage.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Julie George, Phd","affiliation":"University College, London","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Harry Hemingway, PhD","affiliation":"University College, London","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23220717","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Denaxas SC, George J, Herrett E, Shah AD, Kalra D, Hingorani AD, Kivimaki M, Timmis AD, Smeeth L, Hemingway H.
