This trend is due to the limited efficacy of the only approved acute stroke treatment, systemic thrombolysis, in large vessel occlusion but also due to new technical innovations triggering the development of numerous devices for thrombus extraction. Within large single-arm trials, some of these devices demonstrated their potential with respect to acceptable complication- and substantial recanalization rates. Nevertheless, clinical outcome of these stroke patients is frequently poor despite an elaborate, aggressive, but also complex and costly treatment regimen. The factors determining good or poor clinical outcome in mechanical recanalization remain to be determined. The goal of the ENDOSTROKE-registry is the systemic evaluation of technical and clinical features that might be important for the further development and evaluation of endovascular treatment strategies for acute stroke. Special emphasis is laid on the assessment of clinical outcome (90 day MRS). Concerning technical and periprocedural aspects, a focus is put on time issues i.e. intra-hospital time delays, duration of angiographic procedures until vessel patency is achieved.It is planned to enroll approximately 500 patients in this registry. In first line, prospective patients will be included in the register (start date January 2011) but retrospective inclusion of patients being treated within the three years before the start of the register is allowed as long a consecutive patient registration is guaranteed (to exclude selection bias). Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches with respect to clinical outcome measures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, acute","mechanical recanalization","interventional neuroradiology","clinical registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mechanical recanalization","description":"Patients with acute stroke being treated with endovascular devices for mechanical recanalization (no restriction to specific endovascular devices)","interventionNames":["Device: mechanical recanalization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"mechanical recanalization","description":"Endovascular thrombus extraction by mechanical recanalization devices","armGroupLabels":["mechanical recanalization"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical outcome","description":"Proportion of patients with favourable clinical outcome defined as a Modified Rankin Score (MRS) of 0,1, or 2 three months after the intervention.","timeFrame":"approx. 90 days after stroke onset"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Angiographic outcome","description":"Proportion of patients with complete recanalization defined as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Grade 2 or 3.","timeFrame":"Day of intervention"},{"measure":"Complication rate","description":"Periprocedural complication rate defined as a combination of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ECASS classification PH I and PH II), subarachnoid hemorrhage and thrombembolic events.","timeFrame":"within 36 h after endovascular procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients being treated with mechanical recanalization devices due to an acute proximal arterial vessel occlusion of brain supplying arteries\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients being treated with mechanical recanalization devices for venous vessel occlusion.\n* Patients being treated with mechanical recanalization devices due to an acute vessel occlusion which occured as a complication of an angiographic procedure scheduled for other reasons (i.e. as a complication of a diagnostic angiography or coiling procedure for cerebral aneurysms)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke being treated with mechanical recanalization devices for proximal vessel occlusion of brain supplying arteries (i.e. MCA main stem occlusion, basilar artery occlusion, distal ICA occlusion)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Oliver C Singer, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+49 69 6301 5942","email":"o.singer@em.uni-frankfurt.de"},{"name":"Joachim Berkefeld, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+49 69 6301 5462","email":"berkefeld@em.uni-frankfurt.de"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Oliver C.
