If significant desaturation occurs during this period, it may represent an ideal opportunity to further optimize the postoperative care of these patients.","detailedDescription":"Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) is a commonly used technique for maintaining cerebral blood flow (CBF) during the use of hypothermic cardiac arrest (HCA) for aortic arch reconstruction. However, even with an intact Circle of Willis, asymmetric CBF is a common occurrence during HCA when SACP is used. The investigators have previously shown that ultrasound guided extrinsic compression of the left carotid artery can increase left cerebral oxygen saturation, and improved symmetry of CBF; however, this has not been investigated formally. In this study, the investigators will firstly formally assess the incidence and severity of asymmetrical cerebral flow between the left and right hemispheres in patients undergoing aortic arch repair (n=20). CBF will be assessed indirectly through regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) measured via near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oximetry. In addition, a number of clinical outcome parameters (up to 30 days post-op) will be evaluated. The investigators expect that significant left-side cerebral hypoperfusion will consistently be observed in patients undergoing aortic arch repair using SACP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Desaturation","Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["Near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oximetry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of asymmetrical cerebral desaturation","description":"Cerebral desaturation defined as a greater than 10% difference in cerebral saturation comparing one hemisphere to the other based on a baseline reading taken in the minute preceding the onset of HCA to the end of the hypothermic period.","timeFrame":"Duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest between surgical induction and ICU admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Severity of asymmetrical cerebral desaturation","description":"Area of the curve (AUC) and time under the curve (TUC) for all saturation events less than pre-induction baseline as well as for 10%, 15% and 25%, relative reductions under the baseline rSO2 will also be determined.
