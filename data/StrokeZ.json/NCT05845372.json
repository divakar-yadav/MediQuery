In recent years, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy have significantly improved the revascularization rate in patients with large vessel occlusive cerebral infarction, but 20-50% of patients still experience ineffective revascularization. Therefore, postoperative monitoring and treatment of patients with large vessel occlusions is crucial for early recognition, management and prevention of complications. Stress ulcer bleeding is a serious complication after acute ischemic stroke, with a prevalence of 1%-5%, and a previously proven incidence of stress ulcer bleeding after ischemic stroke. Stress ulcer bleeding after ischemic stroke has been shown to be closely associated with unfavorable outcomes, such as mortality. Current national and international guidelines or consensus on the prevention of stress ulcers after acute ischemic stroke do not advocate the routine use of histamine receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors for the prevention of stress ulcers, but rather should be considered in the context of the patient's risk factors for stress ulcers and discontinued after the patient initiates enteral nutrition. However, there is no evidence-based medical evidence to support the risk-benefit relationship of stress ulcer drug prophylaxis in patients with mechanical thrombectomy for acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion.","detailedDescription":"Stress ulcer bleeding is a serious complication after acute ischemic stroke, with a prevalence of 1%-5%, of which only 0.5%-1% require blood transfusion or result in hypotension. Stress ulcer bleeding after ischemic stroke has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes, such as mortality, and basilar artery occlusion and middle cerebral artery cerebral infarction are independent risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding after acute ischemic stroke. Guidelines or consensus on the prevention of stress ulcers after acute ischemic stroke do not advocate the routine use of histamine receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prevention.\n\nHowever, stress ulcer prophylaxis is initiated in most patients admitted to the neurological intensive care unit after mechanical embolization of acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. With advances such as diagnosis and early initiation of enteral nutrition, the rate of stress ulcer bleeding in patients with mechanical embolization of acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion is significantly reduced. The relationship between the risk and benefit of SUP in patients undergoing mechanical embolization for acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion is not yet supported by evidence-based medical evidence. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Stress Ulcer Bleeding","Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2592,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis","description":"Subjects are on stress ulcer medications including PPIs, H2RBs, and mucosal protectors at 24 h of admission."},{"label":"Control Group","description":"Subjects are not on stress ulcer medications including PPIs, H2RBs, and mucosal protectors at 24 h of admission."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"90-day mortality after onset","description":"Proportion of enrolled patients who died 90 days after onset of disease.","timeFrame":"90-day after onset"},{"measure":"Incidence of stroke-associated pneumonia","description":"Incidence of non-mechanically ventilated stroke patients with new pneumonia within 7-day of onset","timeFrame":"within 7-day of onset"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of clinically significant bleeding","description":"One of the following 4 symptoms occurs within 24 hours of bleeding from a stress ulcer (in the absence of other causes):1.
