Some drugs may have a positive effect when combined with physical rehabilitation. Previous studies have shown a potential effect of catecholaminergic drugs on cerebral plasticity of stroke patients. In 2001, our group has demonstrated in a small group of stroke patients (n=8) that a single dose of fluoxetine (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor - SSRI) improved motor performance and modulated cerebral plasticity. We conducted a phase IIb prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study to assess the effect of a daily treatment with fluoxetin (20 mg) on motor performance in patients with mild to severe motor deficit after ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"We project to include in the study a maximum of 168 patients with a recent (5 to 10 days) ischemic stroke and unilateral motor deficit in order to obtain 100 completed patients. Nine stroke centers in France are involved.\n\nEach patient will receive daily, during three months, 20 mg of fluoxetin or placebo.\n\nPatients will be evaluated at inclusion, day 30, M3 (3 months), M12."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Motor Impairment"],"keywords":["Stroke recovery","Pharmacological modulation","Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI)","Fluoxetine","Brain plasticity","Ischemic Stroke and Motor impairment","Modulation of recovery and cerebral plasticity by Fluoxetine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"fluoxetine","interventionNames":["Drug: fluoxetine"]},{"label":"2","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"fluoxetine","description":"fluoxetine per os 20 mg daily","armGroupLabels":["1"],"otherNames":["PROZAC"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"placebo per os daily","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression in the Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale","timeFrame":"M3 (3 months)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"M12 (12 months)"},{"measure":"NIH stroke scale","timeFrame":"M3 and M12"},{"measure":"MADRS depression scale","timeFrame":"M3 and M12"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"M3 and M12"},{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"M3 and M12"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men and women aged from 18 to 85\n* No motor relapse from a previous stroke\n* Inclusion from day 5 to day 10 after stroke\n* Ischemic stroke with unilateral motor deficit\n* Motor NIHSS ≥ 5 on the affected side of the body\n* NIHSS \\< 20\n* Fugl Meyer Motor Scale \\<55\n* Modified Rankin Scale between 1 and 5\n* Informed consent obtained from the subject or a member of his family\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding woman\n* Woman able to procreate without valid contraception\n* Subject protected by law\n* Concomitant disease with unfavourable prognosis within 1 year\n* Drug addiction\n* Allergy to fluoxetine\n* Hepatic failure (TGO and TGP \\>2N)\n* Permanent Renal failure (Creatinin \\>180micromol/l)\n* Patients treated by tricyclic antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, monoamine oxidase inhibitor (IMAO), and neuroleptics in the past month\n* Depression requiring pharmacological treatment\n* Previous stroke with motor relapse\n* Fugl Meyer Motor Scale \\> 55\n* Modified Rankin Scale = 0 or 6\n* Patients needing carotid surgery within 3 months\n* Aphasia preventing correct evaluation of motor and depression scales.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"François Chollet, PhD","affiliation":"University Hospital, Toulouse","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital","city":"Besançon","zip":"25030","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.24878,"lon":6.01815}},{"facility":"University Hospital René Dubos","city":"Cergy-Pontoise","zip":"95303","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":49.03894,"lon":2.07805}},{"facility":"University Hospital","city":"Dijon","zip":"21000","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}},{"facility":"University Hospital","city":"Grenoble","zip":"38048","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.16667,"lon":5.71667}},{"facility":"University Hospital","city":"Nantes","zip":"44093","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.21725,"lon":-1.55336}},{"facility":"University Hospital Pitié Salpétrière","city":"Paris","zip":"75651","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}},{"facility":"University Hospital Sainte Anne","city":"Paris","zip":"75674","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}},{"facility":"University Hospital Rangueil","city":"Toulouse","zip":"31052","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.60426,"lon":1.44367}},{"facility":"University Hospital Purpan","city":"Toulouse","zip":"31059","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.60426,"lon":1.44367}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"11761469","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Pariente J, Loubinoux I, Carel C, Albucher JF, Leger A, Manelfe C, Rascol O, Chollet F.
