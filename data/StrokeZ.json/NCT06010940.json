Their ages ranged from 49 -65 years. Stroke dysphagia was diagnosed by a neurologist. Gugging swallowing screen and A2DS2 score was used to assess risk of developing pneumonia. Stroke associated pneumonia was diagnosed by: Recommended Diagnostic Criteria for Definite and Probable SAP in Patients Not Receiving Mechanical Ventilation Based on the CDC Criteria. The selected patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups control group (A) and study group (B). Control group (A) was treated by nasogastric tube and oral care. Study group (B) was treated as the control group in addition to a designed physical therapy program consisting of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in addition to exercises for oropharyngeal muscles. Assessment was done before treatment, at the middle and at the end of treatment for each patient. Treatment was conducted for five sessions per week for one month."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Dysphagia","Pneumonia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group (A) was treated by nasogastric tube and oral care.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Dietary supplement"]},{"label":"study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study group (B) was treated as the control group in addition to a designed physical therapy program consisting of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in addition to exercises for oropharyngeal muscles.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Dietary supplement","Other: Physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Dietary supplement","description":"nasogastric tube and oral care","armGroupLabels":["control group","study group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Physical therapy","description":"Designed physical therapy program consisting of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in addition to exercises for oropharyngeal muscles.","armGroupLabels":["study group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Gugging swallowing screen test score","description":"Test used to detect dysphagia and aspiration risk.
