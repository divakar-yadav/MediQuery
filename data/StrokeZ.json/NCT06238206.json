The end-users include older adults with sarcopenia, post-stroke individuals and physiotherapists. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n• What are the needs and requirements of the end-user population when developing a lower-limb exoskeleton that can be implemented in a remote home setting?\n\nParticipants will engage in three separate focus group sessions, in which they will discuss the predetermined topics. Interactions between the participants will be guided by open questions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Sarcopenia"],"keywords":["Assistive technology","Exoskeleton","User perspective","Stroke","Sarcopenia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"People post-stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The focus group discussion will assess the needs and requirements of this group.","interventionNames":["Other: Focus group discussion"]},{"label":"Older adults with sarcopenia","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The focus group discussion will assess the needs and requirements of this group.","interventionNames":["Other: Focus group discussion"]},{"label":"Physiotherapists","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The focus group discussion will assess the needs and requirements of this group.","interventionNames":["Other: Focus group discussion"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Focus group discussion","description":"The participant will be asked to take part in three separate focus group discussions implementing the co-design principle.
