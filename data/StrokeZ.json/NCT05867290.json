A small number of studies have investigated the use of music listening as a way to improve sleep in adults with insomnia.\n\nThis study aims to examine whether a mindful music-listening intervention can reduce subjective and objective insomnia symptoms and improve mood and fatigue post-stroke.\n\nSix adults with a clinical diagnosis of stroke presenting with an insomnia disorder will be recruited from stroke services within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. A multiple baseline single case experimental design will be employed. Participants will be randomly allocated to a baseline phase of 7, 11 or 15 days, followed by a five-week mindful music-listening intervention incorporating sleep hygiene. Changes in subjective and objective sleep will be measured using questionnaires and actigraphy, respectively. Mood and fatigue will also be measured. The data will be analysed using visual inspection, Tau-U and multi-level modelling."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cardiovascular Diseases","Brain Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Insomnia","Sleep Disorder","Sleep Disturbance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) methodology using multiple baseline across participants.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Baseline Phase","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Randomly allocated baseline phase (no intervention) of 7, 11 or 15 days."},{"label":"Intervention Phase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"5 week mindful-music listening intervention including sleep hygiene","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Mindful music-listening with sleep hygiene"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Mindful music-listening with sleep hygiene","description":"5 week intervention consisting of sleep hygiene (week 1) and daily bedtime mindful music-listening for 30 minutes or until about to fall asleep, if sooner (weeks 2-5)","armGroupLabels":["Intervention Phase"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sleep onset latency (SOL)","description":"Time taken to fall asleep in minutes measured using actigraphy and a sleep diary completed by the participant.
