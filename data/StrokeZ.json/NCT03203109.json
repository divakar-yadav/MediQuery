Postural and gait disorders in relation to referential of verticality have been analyzed in routine care.","detailedDescription":"300 consecutive patients, admitted in our department for neurorehabilitation after a first hemispherical stroke, have been enrolled retrospectively. During their hospitalisation, all patients have been routinely evaluated with clinical scales, evaluating motor and cognitive deficits. Postural and visual vertical (VV) assessments have been performed 1 to 4 times during in-patient-stay.\n\nThe objective was to analyse the determinants of balance recovery after stroke, in particular the impact of wrong referential of verticality.\n\nData collection was performed by means of medical records. Observation period covered from january 2012 to february 2018."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["lateropulsion","pusher syndrome","posture","balance","PASS","verticality perception","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS)","description":"Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Posture","description":"Change from Baseline Score of Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS) at discharge","timeFrame":"admission and monthly, up to 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Balance","description":"Assessment of Balance and Posture with SCP (Scale for Contraversive Pushing)","timeFrame":"admission and monthly, up to 3 months"},{"measure":"Gait","description":"Assessment of Gait with Lindmark test","timeFrame":"admission and monthly, up to 3 months"},{"measure":"Postural disorders","description":"Assessment of Postural control with CDP (Computerized posturography)","timeFrame":"admission and monthly, up to 3 months"},{"measure":"Visual vertical perception","description":"Assessment of the visual vertical (vv).
