Limited information is available on the predictive value of these scores compared to real outcomes and clinical judgment.\n\nObjectives: To compare clinician judgment with the use of a validated stroke risk score (iScore) and patients' outcomes.","detailedDescription":"A convenience sample of 111 practicing clinicians (general and vascular neurologists, internists, and ER physicians) predicted the outcomes of 5 stroke patients based on case summaries. Cases were randomly selected as being representative of the 10 most common clinical scenarios (n=1,415) from a pool of over 12,000 patients admitted to stroke centers in Ontario, Canada. Stroke cases had known clinical presentation, comorbidities, stroke severity, and outcomes.\n\nAll participants are active practicing physicians caring for patients with acute stroke. Conditions were standardized to mimic clinical practice.\n\nMain outcomes of interest included 30-day mortality and death or disability at discharge.\n\nSecondary outcome: death or institutionalization at discharge"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disease"],"keywords":["stroke","risk score","iScore","outcomes","mortality","disability","institutionalization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":111,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Randomized clinical scenarios","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Clinicians are randomized to a sequence of 5 clinical scenarios","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical scenarios"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical scenarios","description":"Clinicians will be randomized to a sequence of 5 clinical scenarios with a variable range of expected outcome \\[i.e. from low (\\<10%) to high (\\>50%) expected risk death at 30 days\\].","armGroupLabels":["Randomized clinical scenarios"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"30 Day Mortality or Disability (mRS >3) at discharge","timeFrame":"Death after 30 days from ischemic stroke onset or Disability following hospital discharge"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death at 30 days","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Death or institutionalization at discharge","timeFrame":"up to 30 days after discharge"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Practicing and active physicians managing patients with stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* retired physicians\n* physicians not exposed to care for stroke patients","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gustavo Saposnik, MD MSc FRCPC","affiliation":"Unity Health Toronto","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Duke University Medical Center","city":"Durham","state":"North Carolina","zip":"27710","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":35.99403,"lon":-78.89862}},{"facility":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M4N 3M5","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"St Michael's Hospital","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M5B 1W8","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70011,"lon":-79.4163}},{"facility":"McGill University Health Centre","city":"Montreal","state":"Quebec","zip":"H3H 2R9","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":45.50884,"lon":-73.58781}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"22308252","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Saposnik G, Fang J, Kapral MK, Tu JV, Mamdani M, Austin P, Johnston SC; Investigators of the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN); Stroke Outcomes Research Canada (SORCan) Working Group.
