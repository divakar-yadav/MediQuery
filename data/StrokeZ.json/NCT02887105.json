Data from neuropsychological assessment concerning cognitive processes (working and episodic memory) sensitive to different dimensions of anxiety will be analyzed.\n\nThe secondary purpose is to evaluate how some neurological (hemispherical lateralization of lesions), psychological (depression) and demographic (quality of life) variables can increase the effects of different dimensions of anxiety on cognitive processes, during the acute and/or chronic phase of CVA.","detailedDescription":"Data will be collected during usual neuropsychological evaluation and cerebral imagery examination
