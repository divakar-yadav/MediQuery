Evidence from these meta-analyses suggests that such inverse associations may only apply to elderly individuals or those with preexisting major chronic disease.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The investigators will assess the association between habitual chocolate intake and subsequent incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and the potential effect of modification by age.\n\nDESIGN: The investigators will conduct multivariable Cox regression analyses using data from 83,310 postmenopausal women free of baseline preexisting major chronic disease in the prospective Women's Health Initiative cohort. Chocolate intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Physician adjudicated events or deaths were ascertained up to September 30, 2013."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Disease","Heart Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["Coronary heart disease","stroke","chocolate consumption","postmenopausal women","nutrition","dietary intake","epidemiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":83310,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"chocolate consumption level referent","description":"women who ate 1 oz.
