The composition is fractionally extracted from herbs, using flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and pregnenolone in combination with ascorbic acid as the key compounds in preventing and killing SARS-CoV-2; increase antibodies and protect cells; supplementing precursors to help the body strengthen antibodies and reduce the risk of infection; destroy spike protein, toxic protein, help prevent blood clots causing stroke; restore the physiological function of cells after virus infection; helps the body to stabilize the amount of cortisol in the blood as well as stabilize the production of specific antibodies. The composition participates in anti-inflammatory and cells protecting process, bringing blood cortisol, B-lymphocytes, Cyfra 21-1, WBC, CRP, fever, dyspnea, and other signs of respiratory tract inflammation to a normal state and normal limit.","detailedDescription":"AntiCov-220 can eliminate COVID-19 and its variants at a very early stage when they have not had enough time to multiply and cause disease. AntiCov-220 contains precursors, flavonoids, special enzymes responsible for protecting human cell membranes and destroying cell membranes of some viruses, especially, COVID-19 cannot replicate in the presence of AntiCov-220 in the body.\n\nAntiCov-220 contains precursors of cortisol. As the investigators know, cortisol has a cell anti-inflammatory, blood pressure regulation, blood sugar regulation, energy booster, and anti-stress role. It provides precursors to help direct and balance the amount of cortisol in the body that has been imbalanced before.\n\nAntiCov-220 contains flavonoids and Isoflavonoids that are cytoprotective antioxidants, clinically proven to destroy SARS-CoV-2, HBV, HIV, HCV, viruses, reduce complications after COVID-19 infection, prevent neurological sequelae, stroke, cardiovascular sequelae, respiratory sequelae, ...\n\nThe anti-inflammatory, stress-reducing, cell-protective, anti-viral, and immunosuppressive process are performed by an in vivo method that has proven its effectiveness more than ten years ago. AntiCov-220 is an innovative product that can fight against COVID-19 and its variants in the current epidemic situation.\n\nAntiCov-220 is committed to protecting the community of people infected with HBV, HIV, HCV, SARS-CoV-2 against the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic and its mutations.\n\nAntiCov-220 easy to implement, highly effective, and helps reduce public health costs, which is essential in protecting human health.\n\nAntiCov-220 can be used alongside with current standard treatment regimens prescribed by the World Health Organization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Covid19"],"keywords":["AIDS","HIV","HBV","HCV","Stroke","Metabolic dissorder","Stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":82,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AIDS, HIV, HBV, HCV, co-infections.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental benefits in resistance to SARS-COV-2 were observed in all patients who had previously received certain components of the AntiCov-220 (1) for various therapeutic purposes.","interventionNames":["Drug: AntiCov-220 (1)"]},{"label":"\"stable\" cancer, acquired or congenital immunodeficiency.","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental benefits in resistance to SARS-COV-2 were observed in all patients who had previously received certain components of the AntiCov-220 (2) for various therapeutic purposes.","interventionNames":["Drug: AntiCov-220 (2)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"AntiCov-220 (1)","description":"The daily maintenance, AntiCov-220 (1) dose is to take 3 times a day, 1 tablet each time.","armGroupLabels":["AIDS, HIV, HBV, HCV, co-infections."]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"AntiCov-220 (2)","description":"The daily maintenance, AntiCov-220 (2) dose is to take 3 times a day, 1 tablet each time.","armGroupLabels":["\"stable\" cancer, acquired or congenital immunodeficiency."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment on the level of safety and tolerability of patients against the effects of Covid-19.(Arm 1)","description":"COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Anticov-220 characterized by the targeting and destruction of COVID-19\n\n* One case of Covid-19 infection with no severe change in a patient with HBeAg (+).\n* A case of HIV/AIDS turns back to HIV.
