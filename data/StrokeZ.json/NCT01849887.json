Currently approved reperfusion therapies are provided to only a small percentage of patients in the U.S. New therapies are needed that improve outcome and that can be accessed by a majority of patients. Animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered intravenously days after a stroke, safely improve long-term behavioral outcome. A large human experience suggests the safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The current study aims to assess the safety of this therapy in patients with recent ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mesenchymal stem cells","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","interventionNames":["Biological: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","description":"bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","armGroupLabels":["mesenchymal stem cells"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Adverse Events","timeFrame":"1 month after transfusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.
