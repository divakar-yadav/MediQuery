The study will consist of every other week treatment with Replagal for 52 weeks, with periodic reassessments by Shire HGT for continuation of the study beyond 52 weeks. A decision on the part of the study sponsor to terminate the study may be made at any time.\n\nIn Cohort 1, safety and clinical measurement assessments performed during Week 25 or 26 of Study TKT023 served as the baseline assessments for TKT029. Patients in Cohort 1 began treatment with Replagal manufactured using a roller bottle process (Replagal RB); this portion of treatment is denoted as Cohort 1, Phase 1. Safety evaluation visits for Cohort 1, Phase 1 were to be performed at Weeks 13, 25, 55, and every 26 weeks thereafter until the patient discontinued from the study or transitioned to treatment with Replagal manufactured using a bioreactor process (Replagal AF). The transition to Replagal AF marked the restart of the study clock and was denoted as Cohort 1, Phase 2. Safety evaluation visits for Cohort 1, Phase 2 will be performed at Weeks 1, 13, 25, 55, and every 26 weeks thereafter until the patient discontinues from or the sponsor terminates the study.\n\nPatients in Cohort 2 will receive treatment with Replagal AF only; therefore there is only 1 study phase for these patients. Screening assessments performed at Week -1 will serve as the baseline assessments for this study. Safety evaluation visits for Cohort 2 will be performed at Weeks 13, 25, 37, 55 and every 26 weeks thereafter until the patients discontinues from or the sponsor terminates the study.\n\nThe final study visit for both cohorts will follow 30 days after the study study drug infusion, at which time a final safety evaluation will be performed. Patients who complete the study will be interviewed by telephone 30 days after their last study infusion for resolution of any outstanding adverse events (AEs) or concomitant medication changes. Any patient who withdraws early from the study will have a final study visit 30 days after the last study drug infusion, at which time a final safety evaluation will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fabry Disease"],"keywords":["Lysosomes","Storage","Glycolipid","Fabry disease","Stroke","Children","Pediatrics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Agalsidase alfa (Cohort 1)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohort 1: Patients who completed TKT023.","interventionNames":["Drug: Agalsidase alfa"]},{"label":"Agalsidase Alfa (Cohort 2)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohort 2: Treatment-naive patients.","interventionNames":["Drug: Agalsidase alfa"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Agalsidase alfa","description":"0.2 mg/kg agalsidase alfa administered by IV infusion over 40 (+/- 10) minutes every other week for 52 weeks, with periodic reassessments for study continuation beyond 52 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Agalsidase Alfa (Cohort 2)","Agalsidase alfa (Cohort 1)"],"otherNames":["Replagal"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patients Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE)","timeFrame":"362 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve (AUC0-∞) - Week 81","description":"AUC0-∞ is a measure of the total exposure to a drug.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve (AUC0-∞) - Week 133","description":"AUC0-∞ is a measure of the total exposure to a drug.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve (AUC0-∞) - Week 159","description":"AUC0-∞ is a measure of the total exposure to a drug.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve (AUC0-∞) - Week 315/341","description":"AUC0-∞ is a measure of the total exposure to a drug.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) - Week 81","description":"Cmax is the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) - Week 133","description":"Cmax is the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) - Week 159","description":"Cmax is the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) - Week 315/341","description":"Cmax is the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration.","timeFrame":"Pre-infusion; and post-infusion at 20, 40, 50, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 8 hours."}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Heart Rate Variability - Change From Baseline at Week 185 in SDNN","description":"Heart rate variability was assessed by 2-hour Holter monitoring.
