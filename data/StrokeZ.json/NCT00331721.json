Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of enecadin in both male and female patients with acute ischemic stroke will be assessed. Efficacy trends will be evaluated up to day 30 post stroke.","detailedDescription":"In the acute stage of ischemic stroke, an ischemic core characterized by a marked decrease in blood flow is present, leading to irreversible neuronal damage at an early stage. Around the boundary of the ischemic core, there is a region called ischemic penumbra in which functional recovery is possible after recirculation of blood flow within several hours after the onset, even though the blood flow is markedly decreased. Prevention of nerve cell death in the ischemic penumbra by neuroprotective therapy should greatly improve outcome and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic
