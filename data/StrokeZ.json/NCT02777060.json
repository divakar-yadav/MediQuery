A four to six weeks of training with 2 training session/week will be provided.","detailedDescription":"Individuals suffering from certain disorders/diseases including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, osteoarthritis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment or brain Injury are more likely to experience a fall or a fall-related injury than healthy individuals during to impaired postural stability or diminished joint perception. Under certain circumstance they may also experience pain, depression, anxiety, and a decreased quality of life. The investigators' research has been designed to provide exercise training using non-invasive body-worn sensors (similar to those used in an iPhoneÂ®) to provide real-time visual information about joint motion in a virtual environment. These sensors will be worn using a vest, t-shirt or elastic band. The investigators will, 1) assess changes in participant's perception of lower extremity position while they perform these exercises; 2) motivate and guide simple exercise performance in the clinic/home, using an interactive game-like scheme; and 3) assess changes in participant's postural stability and gait as a result of provided exercise training. The information gathered will provide new understanding about more helpful rehabilitation strategies that improve postural stability in patient population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Cancer","Multiple Sclerosis","Arthritis","Parkinson's Disease","Cognitive Disorders","Brain Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["virtual reality","sensor-based balance training","gait","balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exergame","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"inertial sensor based system (wearable sensors, LEGSys, Biosensics LLC) will be used for balance training with computerized feedback.
