While such devices are highly valuable to maintain rowers' fitness, a concern was raised about extensive simulator usage. It was postulated that it could lead to technique alterations due to different biomechanical properties compared to on-water rowing. Slide-based rowing simulators were designed to better simulate on-water conditions.\n\nThe main aim of the study was to compare the differences in various kinematic and kinetic parameters during a short (20 s) all-out rowing bout and during a 2000-m simulated race, to get a better insight into how different rowing simulator designs affect biomechanics of rowing.\n\nThree different rowing simulators were used in this study: (1) a standard stable/fixed rowing simulator, (2) a slides based rowing simulator, i.e. horizontal plane unstable, and (3) a tilt board based rowing simulator; i.e. frontal plane unstable.\n\nThe investigators hypothesised that rowing on different simulators will elicit different biomechanics, including forces, power output, arm and seat movement velocity and amplitude.\n\nEach of the participants completed the tests in all three interventions on separate sessions; random order of interventions. The three sessions took place 7-10 days apart. During each session, the participants completed the all-out 20-s trial first, then the simulated 2000-m race. The aforementioned biomechanical parameters were tracked throughout the trials to be compared between interventions later.","detailedDescription":"The measurements will take place at University of Primorska (Koper, Slovenia) and the subjects will be recruited in close collaboration with Rowing Club Piran. Crossover study design will be used. Each participant will be asked to come for three visits that will be scheduled 7-10 days apart. Prior to measurements onset, the whole protocol will be explained to the participant.\n\nMeasurement procedure:\n\n* 15-min warm-up\n* 20-s maximal (all-out) rowing\n* 5-minute break\n* 2000-m simulated race\n\nAfter both trials, blood lactate will be measured. Blood sample will be taken at the the earlobe by a qualified medical personnel.\n\nMaximal performance test: The participant will perform a 20-s interval with maximal effort. The main aim of the measurement is to record the maximal exerted force and power. The custom adapted device (Concept 2 Rowing Simulator) records the positions (seat and handle) and force (legs push and handle pull), which enables for further calculations of segmental and common kinematics and dynamics parameters.\n\nRace simulation: the participant will complete the 2000-m simulated race and will be instructed to aim for the best results. The same measurements as in the maximal performance test will be performed. Wireless heart rate monitor will be used to record the heart frequency throughout the trial.\n\nEquipment:\n\nThe custom adapted rowing simulator (Concept 2) allows for the measurements of stoke forces and consequently power outputs, seat and handle velocity, and seat and handle amplitudes. Signals will be transferred to central unit, amplified and converted, and stored on a personal computer.\n\nThe interventions (i.e. the studied rowing conditions) will be as follows:\n\n* a standard stable/fixed rowing simulator,\n* a slides based rowing simulator, i.e. horizontal plane unstable, and\n* a tilt board based rowing simulator; i.e. frontal plane unstable."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy"],"keywords":["wobble board","slides","rowing stroke","rowing biomechanics","power output"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"All participants in the study will complete the measurements for all the three rowing interventions; in a random order.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The investigator who processed the acquired data was blinded for rowing interventions and subject information."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A group of rowers to be administered to intervention on a Stable rowing simulator, a Slides based rowing simulator or a Tilt board based rowing simulator.","interventionNames":["Device: Stable rowing simulator","Device: Slides based rowing simulator","Device: Tilt board based rowing simulator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Stable rowing simulator","description":"a standard stable/fixed rowing simulator","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Slides based rowing simulator","description":"a slides based rowing simulator, i.e. horizontal plane unstable","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Tilt board based rowing simulator","description":"a tilt board based rowing simulator; i.e. frontal plane unstable","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rowing performance","description":"Rowing biomechanics on different rowing simulators.","timeFrame":"Three sessions, with randomized order of ergometers (7-10 days apart)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Arm velocity","description":"Change of the average velocity of arm movement through the rowing stroke.","timeFrame":"At the onset of test, at the finish and at the three points in between (at 500, 1000 and 1500 meters of the simulated race) - ref.
