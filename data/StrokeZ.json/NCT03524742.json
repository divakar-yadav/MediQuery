The interventions will be: A) Avocado based Mediterranean diet with intake of ½ portion of a Hass avocado per day and B) Standard recommendation of low fat-high complex carbohydrate diet recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association. The main efficacy outcome will be the level of plasma LDL-C level at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes will be changes in: Levels of serum lipid profile, serum inflammation markers, glycemic control, anthropomorphic measures, stroke recurrence, cardiovascular events, adverse events, compliance. A sample size of 100 patients per group (200 in total) was estimated to provide 80% power and 5% level of significance with 10% loss and 5% crossover to detect the same difference in LDL-C after 3 months of intervention in patients with acute stroke. The investigators hypothesize that an Avocado based Mediterranean diet will significantly reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol at 3 months in patients who have suffered a recent acute ischemic stroke compared to the standard diet.","detailedDescription":"Introduction: Stroke is the second cause of death and the third of years of life lost worldwide. In Chile, stroke is the second cause of death. Ischemic stroke represents roughly 80% of all strokes. The 11 risk factors responsible for 91.8% of the population attributable risk of ischemic stroke are: Age, Blood Pressure ≥140/90mmHg, smoking, waist to hip ratio, Diabetes Mellitus, physical activity, alcohol intake, psychosocial factors, Apo-lipoproteins, Cardiac causes and noteworthy a healthy diet (35.8% of the population attributable risk). Recent global burden of disease analysis of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), showed that dietary risk have the highest DALYs in ischemic stroke among behavioral risk factors. The MediDiet is associated with a decreased risk of total mortality as well as stroke incidence and mortality. Although not part of the classical Mediterranean diet they are another nutrient-dense source of mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols extensively consumed in the Americas. Avocado-substituted diets significantly decrease cholesterol levels in diabetic and obese patients. Secondary stroke prevention studies with diet as an intervention are lacking and there is very little information of what patients eat before or after an ischemic stroke. Recurrent stroke represent 20% of all ischemic strokes at a population level and depending on the etiology, recurrent stroke can occur from 2 to 20% at 3 months of the initial event. Lowering Low Density Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreases stroke recurrence.\n\nGoals: The aim is to determine the effect of a Mediterranean style diet based on Avocados as a source of poli unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on lipid profile particularly LDL-C in patients who have had an ischemic stroke and are at high recurrence risk.\n\nMethodology: Academic, open-label, blinded outcome assessment (prospective, randomized, open-blinded end-point \\[PROBE design\\]), clinical trial. Participants will be patients with an acute ischemic stroke admitted to Clínica Alemana de Santiago, who fulfills the eligibility criteria. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either diet intervention in a 1:1 ratio. The interventions will be: A) Avocado based Mediterranean diet with intake of ½ portion of a Hass avocado per day and B) Standard recommendation of low fat-high complex carbohydrate diet recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association. The main efficacy outcome will be the level of plasma LDL cholesterol level at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes will be changes in: Levels of serum lipid profile, serum inflammation markers, glycemic control, anthropomorphic measures of the metabolic syndrome, stroke recurrence, cardiovascular events, adverse events, compliance. A sample size of 100 patients per group (200 in total) was estimated to provide 80% power and 5% level of significance with 10% loss and 5% crossover to detect the same difference in LDL-C after 3 months of intervention in patients with acute stroke. The following measurements will be performed at baseline and at 3 months in all patients: Blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, glucose level, serum insulin level, Apo- lipoproteins A1 and B levels, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, Apo lipoproteins A and B, and interleukin-6 levels; In a random sample of participants (35%), investigators will measure the oleic acid plasma content as a measure of adherence to Avocado intake."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Diet","Cholesterol"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Academic, open-label, blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design), clinical trial.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"open-label, blinded outcome assessment","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Avocado-Mediterranean Diet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Avocado based Mediterranean diet with intake of ½ portion of a Hass avocado per day, during 3 months.","interventionNames":["Other: Avocado-Mediterranean Diet"]},{"label":"Control-Group Diet","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control-Group Diet consists of a low fat-high complex carbohydrate diet, during 3 months.","interventionNames":["Other: Control-Group Diet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Avocado-Mediterranean Diet","description":"Mediterranean diet including 1/2 portion of Hass avocado per day, considering a minimum 35% of calories as fat (22% MUFA fat, 6% PUFA fat, and ±10% saturated fat), 15% proteins, and a maximum of 50% carbohydrates.","armGroupLabels":["Avocado-Mediterranean Diet"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control-Group Diet","description":"A low fat-high complex carbohydrate diet, during 3 months.","armGroupLabels":["Control-Group Diet"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"LDL cholesterol level","description":"Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level in mg/dL level at 3 months of the dietary intervention.","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Levels of total cholesterol","description":"Total cholesterol level in mg/dL at 3 months of dietary intervention","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"HDL Cholesterol level","description":"High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in mg/dL level at 3 months of the dietary intervention.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Triglycerides level","description":"Triglycerides level in mg/dL level at 3 months of the dietary intervention.","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Systolic blood pressure","description":"Mean systolic blood pressure in mmHg","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Waist to hip ratio","description":"Measure of waist diameter in centimeters and hip diameter in centimeters to report waist to hip ratio","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Body mass index","description":"Weight in kilograms and height in meters will be combined to report body mass index in kg/m\\^2","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Serious adverse events","description":"Frequency of serious adverse events","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Stroke Recurrence","description":"Frequency of stroke recurrence","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Frequency of major cardiovascular events","description":"Frequency of major cardiovascular events (composed by acute myocardial infarction, stroke or vascular death).","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"ICAM serum level","description":"ICAM (intercelular adhesion molecule) in ng/mL","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Interleukin-6 serum level","description":"Level of Interleukin-6 in ng/mL","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Apolipoproteins levels A and B","description":"Level of Apolipoporoteins A and B in g/L","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"VCAM serum level","description":"VCAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule) in ng/mL","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Determine plasma oleic acid levels in a subgroup","description":"Measurement of plasma oleic acid levels compared to basal in a randomized sample of 35% of group randomized to avocado based mediterranean diet","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
