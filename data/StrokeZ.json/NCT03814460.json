Indeed, the degree of spasticity depends, among other things, on the stretching velocity performed to the muscle. However, most of the tools used in the clinical setting to assess spasticity do not take into account the relationship between increased muscle tone and speed of stretching. Instead of that, muscle tone is usually assessed in a relaxed position of the muscle.\n\nLikewise, to date, despite the functional disabilities related to the presence of chronic pain after a stroke, no previous study has correlated muscle tone and pressure pain sensitivity within this population"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Muscle Tone Abnormalities","Pain","Muscle Spasticity"],"keywords":["Topographical mapping","Muscle state of tension","Myotonometer","Pressure Pain Threshold","Muscle Thickness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","description":"A control group of healthy subjects with no previous history of neurological disorders or conditions.

Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), as the minimum necessary pressure force to evoke pain, will be assessed bilaterally over biceps brachii and the gastrocnemius muscles (medial and lateral). Assessments will be made using a topographical mapping covering myotendinous and muscle belly sites in the above mentioned muscles. A 30-second break will be used between assessments to prevent bruising, and an average of the two measures over each site will be calculated for the statistical analysis. Pressure algometry is reliable in healthy individuals, and in stroke patients","timeFrame":"One time assessment"},{"measure":"Muscle Tone Assessment, using the modified Tardieu Scale","description":"The modified Tardieu Scale is the most common tool used in the clinical setting to evaluate the muscle tone. The muscle response to a slow and fast stretching will be performed.

This device delivers a multi-scan mode of three brief mechanical impulses, each one shortly followed by a quick release, to record the damped natural oscillation of the muscle using an accelerometer.\n\nEvaluations will be made in the affected and non-affected sides of stroke patients and in dominant and non-dominant sides of control participants.","timeFrame":"One time assessment"},{"measure":"Muscle State of Tension (Muscle Tone), assessed by a myotonometer","description":"The tone of the biceps brachii and gastrocnemius muscles will be collected using a handheld myotonometer device, the MyotonPRO, (Myoton AS, Estonia).
