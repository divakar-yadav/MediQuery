(6)\n\nThe pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is complex, and several studies documented hypercoagulable states as a significant mechanism underlying stroke. (8).\n\nThe latter include protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiencies, activated protein C resistance and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLA), including anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies or lupus anticoagulant (LAC), which influence stroke susceptibility owing to their capacity to disturb normal hemostatic mechanisms (9).\n\nWhile aPLA are clinically associated with a state of hypercoagulation and prothrombotic disorders, the exact mechanism underlying their prothrombotic effects remains unknown (10).\n\naPLA are detected either functionally, owing to their ability to prolong coagulation time in a phospholipid-dependent coagulation test (LAC), or by measuring specific \\[anticardiolipin (aCL) and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS)\\] antibodies by specific immunoassays, using anionic phospholipids as antigens (11).\n\nThe contribution of LAC to the overall risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis, including ischemic stroke, is now well recognized (12).\n\nWhile the contribution of aPLA (including LAC and aCL antibodies) to thrombosis is well established, their role as independent risk factors in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke yielded apparently conflicting results. (13).\n\nThese conflicting results could be explained by differences in ethnic origin , inherent variation in aPLA levels and in the failure in some studies to account for the contribution of covariates (14).\n\nOsteopontin (OPN) was first identified as a protein involved in bone remodelling, but later also shown to have important immunological roles. (15)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke in Young Adults"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke with antiphospholipid","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: antiphospholipid Abs"]},{"label":"stroke without antiphospholipid","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: antiphospholipid Abs"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"antiphospholipid Abs","description":"Laboratory test","armGroupLabels":["Stroke with antiphospholipid","stroke without antiphospholipid"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke patients with APs","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* A study was included if it reported on the laboratory investigation of any aPL and confirmed CVE\n* Included patients aged \\<50 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Exclusion criteria included non-atherosclerotic causes, rheumatic heart disease, ventricular arrhythmias, uncompensated heart failure, stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation, hematoma, brain tumors, accidental or iatrogenic stroke, arterial malformation and recent acute myocardial infarction.
