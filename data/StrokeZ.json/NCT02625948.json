For individuals who are at high risk for hemorrhage growth, the study will compare the drug Tranexamic acid to placebo to determine the effect and safety of on intracerebral hemorrhage growth","detailedDescription":"The Tranexamic Acid for Acute ICH Growth prEdicted by Spot Sign (TRAIGE) is a is a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective, investigator-led, clinical trial of tranexamic acid within 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with contrast extravasation on CTA, 'the spot sign'. ICH patients within 6 hours of symptom onset, with the spot sign as a biomarker for ongoing hemorrhage, and no contraindications for antifibrinolytic therapy were enrolled in TRAIGE. The patient with a spot sign will be randomized to receive either the active treatment or placebo, the patient with no spot sign will be given regular treatment as observation. The trial is anticipated to complete in 36 months from the first subject recruitment , with 240 subjects recruited. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by IRB(Institutional Review Board) /EC(Ethics Committee) in Beijing Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Stroke"],"keywords":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","tranexamic acid","spot sign"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":240,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tranexamic acid","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"tranexamic acid","interventionNames":["Drug: Tranexamic Acid"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"0.9% NaCl","interventionNames":["Drug: Tranexamic Acid"]},{"label":"observation(spot sign -)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"regular clinical treatment"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tranexamic Acid","armGroupLabels":["Placebo","tranexamic acid"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"hemorrhage growth","description":"either \\>33% or \\>6 ml increase from baseline, adjusted for baseline ICH volume","timeFrame":"24±2 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major thromboembolic events","description":"(1) acute myocardial ischemia; (2) acute cerebral ischemia; and (3) acute pulmonary embolism","timeFrame":"30±4 days"},{"measure":"Poor clinical outcome","description":"The Number of patients that is Death or major disability(mRS 4-6)","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"short-term outcome","description":"The Number of patients that with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2 at 30±4 days","timeFrame":"30±4 days"},{"measure":"Other thromboembolic events","description":"Other thromboembolic events，such as venous thrombosis and other peripheral arterial embolism","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"Death due to any cause","description":"Number of patients that is Death due to any cause by 90±7 days","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Absolute ICH growth volume","description":"The absolute ICH growth volume compared with the baseline CT scan","timeFrame":"24±2 hours"},{"measure":"Absolute IVH growth volume","description":"The absolute IVH growth volume compared with the baseline CT scan","timeFrame":"24±2 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients presenting with an acute spontaneous hypertensive Intracerebral hemorrhage\n\n1.
