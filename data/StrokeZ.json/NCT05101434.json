Several studies have been carried out on the dependence of periodontitis and stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate gingivitis and periodontitis as risk factors for stroke in the Pakistani population.","detailedDescription":"Epidemiologic studies have shown that cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the 3rd cause of death in developed countries with 0.8 % prevalence in the whole population. Although, the prevalence rate of stroke is reduced yet is one of the most important health problems in the United State. Periodontitis and gingivitis are the two most infectious man diseases. Today, it is estimated that about 35% of people over 30-year-old in America and 50-55% of people in developing countries are involved with these diseases.\n\nThese diseases are due to the practice of chronic bacterial infection and the inflammatory response of the host. The relationship between periodontitis and CVA was first introduced by Mackenzi and Millard in 1963 but the importance of this issue was not understood. Periodontal infection can be a complex multiphase disease by associating this infection with organ systems such as cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, and respiratory systems. Nowadays, periodontitis is considered a risk factor for atherosclerosis and thromboembolic disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gingivitis","Periodontitis","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Periodontal Probing","description":"with the help Michigan probe, periodontal pocket measurement was done.","otherNames":["ROAG revised oral assessment guide","Community periodontal index","Gingival Index"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gingivitis","description":"Measurement of bleeding site while probing and this was done with gingival index","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Periodonitis","description":"Measurement of periodontal pockets while probing and this was done with community periodontal idex","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosed stroke by using brain imaging from magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized tomography.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Not willing to participate\n* Neurological complications other than stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All the patients with stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Muhammad Hassan, MD","affiliation":"Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University","city":"Islamabad","state":"Capital","zip":"44000","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":33.72148,"lon":73.04329}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"Data will be shared on reasonable demand"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000005891","term":"Gingivitis"},{"id":"D000010518","term":"Periodontitis"},{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010510","term":"Periodontal Diseases"},{"id":"D000009059","term":"Mouth Diseases"},{"id":"D000009057","term":"Stomatognathic Diseases"},{"id":"D000007239","term":"Infections"},{"id":"D000005882","term":"Gingival Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13117","name":"Periodontitis","asFound":"Periodontitis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M8693","name":"Gingivitis","asFound":"Gingivitis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13109","name":"Periodontal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11709","name":"Mouth Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11707","name":"Stomatognathic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9973","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6058","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8684","name":"Gingival Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
