One week the following test will be taken: Berg Balance Scale, 10m walking test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, knee extension and elbow extension strength with the microfet2, Basic-ADL and Geriatric Depression Scale.\n\nThe other week there will be a group session, this could be in sitting (like moving on music) or standing (like petanque).\n\nWalking will be practiced every day of the week and individual needs (like specific hand rehabilitation or pain problems) will be addressed besides the program when needed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hip Fractures","Abdominal Injury","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"],"keywords":["geriatric patients","elderly","multicomponent physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"explorative study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":111,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg","type":"OTHER","description":"intensive multicomponent physical therapy week program","interventionNames":["Other: Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg","description":"intensive multicomponent physical therapy week program","armGroupLabels":["Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Independence for activities of daily living","description":"Independence for ADL measured with the Basic-ADL","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"Functional Balance","description":"Functional balance measured with the Berg Balance Scale","timeFrame":"four weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking speed","description":"Walking speed measured with the 10m walking test","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"Strength of arm Extension","description":"Strength of arm extension, measured with the microFET2 hand held dynamometer.
