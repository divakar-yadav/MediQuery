document the clinical course of patients at 12 months or more following an ischaemic stroke","detailedDescription":"Primary objective:\n\nTo document and better define the prognostic characteristics of residual disability 12 months or more following an ischaemic stroke in patients that originally participated in the preceding clinical study RN-CS-0001.\n\nOther objective:\n\nTo inform the design of efficient Phase 2/3 studies when screening potentially efficacious interventions for signals of activity which merit further

one of the 4 functional assessment tests (ARAT, BI, NIHSS, mRS) at any time point on the previous study RN-CS-0001\n* Ability to participate in all assessments and attend all visits\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any additional incidence of stroke (Ischaemic or Haemorrhagic) since participation in the previous study RN-CS-0001 (since the last CS-0001 assessment visit date).\n* Incidence of significant other disease that judged by the investigator would confound completion of all functional assessments (not excluding patients that can complete at least one functional assessment with no confounding factor from significant other disease).","sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients assessed as part of the preceding study RN-CS-0001 which
