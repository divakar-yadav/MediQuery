The data acquisition and medical quality management still need to be improved in China. The purpose of this study was to establish online database of acute stroke patients for stroke management quality evaluation in China.","detailedDescription":"This study is a prospective multi-center registration study. The data of acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent reperfusion therapy were registered on emergency platform. The data of stroke patients who were hospitalized were registered on stroke meidical quality control platform. The information including demographics, risk factors (history of hypertension, diabetes, stroke/TIA or atrial fibrillation, etc), prior antiplatelet usage, onset to door time (ODT), baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, baseline infarct core volume, laboratory data, ect were recorded. Clinical outcome at 3 months and 1 year was assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["thrombolysis","thrombectomy","hospitalization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Education","description":"Provide each center with relevant education of guidelines, and help the clinicians to improve medical quality."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Independence (mRS 0-2) at 1 year","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"All-cause mortality at 1 year","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Brain hemorrhage at 24-72 hours after hospitalization","timeFrame":"72 hours"},{"measure":"The incidence of recurrent stroke or other vascular events at 1 year","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Independence (mRS 0-2) at 5 year","timeFrame":"5 year"},{"measure":"The incidence of recurrent stroke or other vascular events at 5 year","timeFrame":"5 year"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality at 5 year","timeFrame":"5 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAcute stroke patients\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nNo","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All acute stroke patients who were admitted to hospital.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Min Lou, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"13958007213","email":"loumingxc@vip.sina.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Min Lou, PhD","affiliation":"Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Min Lou","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Hangzhou","state":"Zhejiang","zip":"310000","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Zexin Chen","role":"CONTACT","phone":"13757118366","email":"HREC2013@126.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":30.29365,"lon":120.16142}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34702747","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Wang J, Zhang J, Gong X, Zhang W, Zhou Y, Lou M.
