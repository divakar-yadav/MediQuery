To determine additional stroke patient (SP) and stroke caregiver (SC) factors including their perceptions of the stroke experience, hospitalization, and how they cope with its challenges; identify additional appropriate points to intervene (maladaptive coping styles, unrealistic expectations, inappropriate prioritization, misinformation about illness, and self care), and assess SP and SC preferences for the structure, mode of delivery (including potential for phone, video or a combination of these) and timing of an intervention.\n2. To develop, \\[using the preliminary data and information from aim 1\\], and test the feasibility and acceptability (primary outcomes) of a skills-based intervention for preventing chronic depression, anxiety, PTSD and decreased QoL in dyads at risk."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurological Disorder"],"keywords":["Intensive Care Unit"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Psychosocial Skills-Based Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Based on information from Phase I (semi-structured interviews), the investigators will develop a detailed psychosocial intervention manual. The intervention will be tailored consistent with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for stroke skills based interventions and will include 2 general and 4 specific modules (selected from 7 available). Generally, in the intervention, stroke patients and stroke caregivers will learn skills to cope and manage stroke-related stressors. It is anticipated that the intervention will have 6 sessions with 2 general sessions delivered within the NICU face to face and 4 tailored specific sessions to be delivered via live video using Vidyo.
