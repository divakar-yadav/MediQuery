The investigators want to improve the clinical condition and quality of life of post-STROKE participants with a special sensory motor and visual motor agility therapy. High intensity motion improves engine function and quality of life in a neurologist. With special sensory motor and visual motility, investigaters want to improve the clinical condition and quality of life of STROKE participants. The investigaters randomly select participants who only perform the rehabilitation treatment have performed. The other group that will receive the study's control group will receive the traditional rehabilitation physiotherapy treatment. The investigaters assess the condition and quality of life of the patients. (EQ5-D, Barthel index, MRS test) The ivestigaters examine the functional movement and equilibrium variables of patients. (6MWT, Berg balance test, postgraduation) After that, participants are undergoing a 4-week intensive rehabilitation treatment. All participants are in post stroke. Primary Hypothesis will be changes in life-quality tests (EQ5-D, Barthel index, MRS test). Functional tests show progress 6MWT, Berg balance test and postural control testing with posturography. The results are compared and evaluated among the groups. The expected hypothesis is that visual and acoustic stimulation produces a better physical state at higher intensity. Patients were followed for 2 years and participated in a follow-up study every six months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["balance","movement","exergaming","posture","quality of life","gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise+FU 2/week","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Post stroke group that received 2 years of intensive therapy.
