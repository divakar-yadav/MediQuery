A better understanding of the stroke aetiology may improve secondary stroke prevention and long term outcome.","detailedDescription":"Variations and delays in the diagnostic procedures during hospitalization after acute ischemic stroke are still common, and at the same time, stroke aetiology remains cryptogenic in about 20-25% of stroke unit patients. Recent studies have shown that (a) cardiac MRI is now able to detect cardiac sources of embolism (thrombi and aortic plaques) with equal sensitivity as compared to echocardiography, and (b) prolonged ECG monitoring up to several days/weeks/years can significantly increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation. These developments might allow a faster and more effective diagnostic work-up in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared to standard diagnostic procedures including doppler-ultrasound of the extracranial brain-supplying arteries, echocardiography, 24-h-Holter ECG and stroke unit monitoring. This prospective observational trial therefore aims to assess the detection rate of pathologic findings relevant to stroke aetiology as obtained by an enhanced MRI set-up (including cardiac MRI, MR-angiography of the brain-supplying arteries) and a prolonged Holter-ECG (of up to 5 days after the stroke) in comparison to findings obtained by routine diagnostic procedures after acute stroke.\n\nMoreover, cumulating evidence implies that acute ischemic stroke can lead to cardiac damage. Since the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood, the HEBRAS study attempts to tackle the relationship between stroke localization (e.g. insular involvement), observed cardiac damage (as indicated by troponin elevation) and activation of autonomic nervous system (as indicated by impairment of heart rate variability and elevated urinary norepinephrine levels), respectively.\n\nFinally, to clarify the prognostic impact of stroke-induced autonomic dysfunction, heart rate variability will be analysed with respect to functional outcome, mortality, recurrent stroke and myocardial injury."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Stroke","Atrial fibrillation","Holter ECG","cardiac MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Biomarkers indicating myocardial damage (cardiac Troponin T), autonomic function (Norepinephrine), prediction of atrial fibrillation (BNP)."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":368,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute Ischemic Stroke","description":"Patients older than 18 years with an acute ischemic stroke (according to WHO criteria), stroke onset within 2 days, language: German, MRI compatibility, admission to the stroke unit at the Charité, Campus Benjamin Franklin."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke aetiology","description":"Detection rate of pathologic findings relevant to stroke aetiology (i.e. atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombi, severe carotid stenosis, aortic plaque \\> 4mm) in patients with acute ischemic stroke obtained by enhanced diagnostic MRI work-up (cardiac MRI, MR-angiography combined with prolonged Holter-ECG of up to 5 days during the in-hospital stay) in comparison to findings obtained by the routine diagnostic work-up at the Department of Neurology;
