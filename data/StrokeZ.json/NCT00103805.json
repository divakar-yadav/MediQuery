In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether the effect can be replicated using a within-subject design, with administration of levodopa and placebo on alternate days for a total period of 10 days.\n\nThe expected scientific results will strengthen the basis for transferring neuromodulatory interventions from the laboratory to stroke patients with language dysfunctions. Because of the heterogeneity of stroke patients, only a within-subject design can be used to probe the effects of pharmacological adjuncts to language therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy"],"keywords":["language acquisition","plasticity","stroke recovery","associative learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"levodopa"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Boost in language learning success through levodopa compared to placebo"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stability of language learning success after one month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy subjects\n* 20-35 years old\n* Right handedness\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neurological/psychiatric/metabolic/cardiac disorders\n* Asthma\n* Known allergic reactions to one of the experimental drugs\n* Other drugs affecting the central nervous system\n* Leisure drug ingestion during the past 4 weeks (urine test)\n* Smoking cessation during the past 2 weeks\n* \\> 6 cups of coffee or energy drinks per day\n* \\> 10 cigarettes per day\n* \\> 50 grams of alcohol per day","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"35 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Caterina Breitenstein, PhD","affiliation":"Dept. of Neurology, University of Muenster, Germany","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Stefan Knecht, MD","affiliation":"Dept. of Neurology, University of Muenster, Germany","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Dept. of Neurology, University Hospital Muenster","city":"Muenster","state":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","zip":"48129","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":51.96236,"lon":7.62571}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"15236398","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Knecht S, Breitenstein C, Bushuven S, Wailke S, Kamping S, Floel A, Zwitserlood P, Ringelstein EB.
