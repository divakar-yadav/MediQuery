Approaches to weight-loss are lacking, yet necessary, due to the unique physiological and cognitive needs of persons with CVA. There is evidence that interventions that improve physical activity and healthy eating behaviors concurrently offer greatest potential for weight-loss. The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) intervention is a 12-month, evidence-based weight-loss program that has been used extensively with the general population, but not with people after CVA. Investigators modified the program to meet the needs of people post stroke (GLB-CVA).\n\nStudy Aims:\n\nThe study consists of five specific aims.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To create an appropriate adaptation of the DPP-GLB program that meets the unique needs of people post CVA (GLB-CVA) using a Community-Based Participatory Research approach and Advisory Board of key stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To establish the feasibility of delivering the GLB-CVA intervention.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of the GLB-CVA on primary and secondary outcomes in the intervention group compared to the wait-list control group at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline.\n\nSpecific Aim 4: Describe the effect of the GLB-CVA on metabolic biomarkers in the experimental group compared to the wait-list control group at baseline, 3, and 6 months.\n\nSpecific Aim 5: Describe the association between biomarkers of neurodegeneration and physiologic, functional, and patient reported outcomes at baseline, 3, and 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Group Lifestyle Balance","Physical Activity","Stroke","Weight-loss","Dietary Behaviors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).
