(2) an attention demanding task will decrease gait stability and (3) the improvement in gait stability due to ankle-foot orthosis use will be greater during an attention demanding task.","detailedDescription":"A quasi-experimental, randomized 2 x 2 factorial within subjects study with the factor of walking condition (2 levels, walking with and without ankle-foot orthotic device) and attention condition (2 levels, walking with and without attention task)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"People who have had a stroke and have an ankle-foot orthosis."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Velocity","description":"walking velocity","timeFrame":"up to one week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"trunk acceleration","description":"trunk acceleration during walking","timeFrame":"up to one week"},{"measure":"Step length variability","description":"variability of right and left step length during walking","timeFrame":"up to one week"},{"measure":"The Berg Balance Scale","description":"Functional balance measured using the Berg Balance Scale short form.","timeFrame":"up to one week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* be over the age of 18;\n* have the presence of hemiplegia after stroke;\n* be wearing an ankle-foot orthosis for at least 6 weeks;\n* be able to walk independently and comfortably for a minimum distance of 12 m with or without assistive aids (AFOs, canes and walkers);\n* be able to read and understand English, follow verbal instructions and provide verbal answers to questions;\n* be able to reach criterion on the attention task (described below)\n* be competent to give informed consent as determined by clinical team and noted in the health chart\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* have history of balance deficits not related to stroke;\n* be at high risk of falling during the study;\n* suffer from severe aphasia or dementia as determined by health chart and/or initial cognitive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"People who have had a hemiplegic stroke and have an ankle-foot orthosis.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Kim Parker, M.A.Sc.","affiliation":"CDHA","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Capital Health","city":"Halifax","state":"Nova Scotia","zip":"B3H 4K4","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":44.64533,"lon":-63.57239}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020233","term":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21748","name":"Gait Disorders, Neurologic","asFound":"Gait, Hemiplegic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
