The patients were randomly assigned to Edoxaban or Warfarin groups. Primary outcome was a composite of stroke and systemic arterial thromboembolism. The safety outcome was major bleeding.","detailedDescription":"Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are generally recommended as 1st line therapy for oral anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). But, the efficacy and safety of NOAC in AF patients with prosthetic mechanical heart valves or moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis have not been proven, and the guidelines recommend vitamin K antagonist (VKA) administration to those patient groups. This trial aims to compare the efficacy and safety of the edoxaban and the warfarin in AF patients with moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis.\n\nEdoxaban in patients with aTrial fibrillation and MItral Stenosis (ERTEMIS) trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, investigator initiated phase 2 trial. The patients were randomly assigned to Edoxaban or Warfarin groups. The primary efficacy outcome is a composite of stroke and systemic arterial thromboembolism. The secondary efficacy outcomes are each component of the primary efficacy outcomes and death from any cause. The safety outcome was major bleeding."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mitral Valve Stenosis","Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Systemic Embolism"],"keywords":["Edoxaban","Warfarin","Stroke","Systemic embolism","Mitral Valve Stenosis","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":240,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Edoxaban","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in the Edoxaban group take Edoxaban 60mg once daily.
