It is open to the public. Healthy individuals and individuals who are or have been infected with COVID-19 are encouraged to join the effort. The study can be done at home with internet access and an iPad or iPhone. Participation takes about one hour.\n\nTo learn more, go to https://www.mirohealth.com/consent/","detailedDescription":"Neurological complications have been reported in patients with COVID-19. To better understand neurological complications, a group of research hospitals are collaborating to track neurological outcomes. We know that COVID-19 can invade our nervous system, but little is known about the range of effects that COVID-19 might have on the brain. This study aims to gain real-time information about the neurological health of the U.S. population to advance knowledge of COVID-19.\n\nAt the conclusion of the study, you will receive non-medical information on your brain function as well as study findings and publications made possible by your participation. With your permission, Miro Health can also release the results of your assessment to your physician. In order for Miro Health to do this, you will be required to confirm your identity online, sign a HIPAA agreement to share the information with your physician, and to enter your physician's name, email, and contact information. Study duration will depend on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo participate, you must submit a valid email. No other personally identifiable information will be gathered at this time.\n\nTo participate, you will:\n\nAnswer online questions Answer a few questions about your health Download the Miro Health app from the iTunes store Open the app and complete Miro's interactive tasks (30 mins)\n\nAdvisory: Should you feel that you have symptoms related to COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider or local community health office. Miro Health cannot provide healthcare assistance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Health"],"keywords":["COVID-19","neurocognitive","stroke","nervous system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Test the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection will lead to increased risk of neurological impairment","description":"Each participant's Risk Score of mild cognitive impairment will be calculated using machine learning methods on a percent range of 0-100%.
