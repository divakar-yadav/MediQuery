In AF, the upper heart chambers don't pump blood effectively into the lower chambers. When this happens, a blood clot can form, dislodge and leave the heart blocking an artery in the brain and cause a stroke. However, AF is often an intermittent condition and therefore difficult to diagnose. As such, there are a group of patients in whom no cause of their stroke can be identified.\n\nIn this study, we will recruit 92 patients from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, Princess Royal University Hospital and King's College London.\n\nAs part of routine clinical care, patients undergo insertion of an Implantable Loop Recorder (CE Marked device), a minimally invasive procedure that allows accurate beat-to-beat monitoring to identify patients who develop intermittent AF post-stroke. We will request access to the data collected from this device and perform atrial MRI imaging in these patients to compare the findings between patients that do and do not have AF. If we show that atrial MRI scans are significantly different between patients with and without AF, we will use this information to support a trial of starting appropriate therapies (e.g. blood thinners) in these patients on the basis of MRI findings. This approach would have the advantage of enabling therapies to be offered to the right patients earlier and prevent repeat, potentially disabling stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":92,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atrial Fibrillation Group","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Cardiac MRI"]},{"label":"Non-Atrial Fibrillation Group","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Cardiac MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Cardiac MRI","description":"These are routinely performed for many cardiac conditions, including atrial arrhythmias.
