Using the personalized brain functional sectors (pBFS) technique, investigators could precisely identify individualized brain functional networks and the personalized language-related stimulation site based on the resting-state functional MRI data. The current study proposes to conduct a double-blinded, randomized and parallel controlled design trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of pBFS-guided personalized rTMS intervention in post-stroke aphasic patients.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to the following six groups: active 1200-pulse cTBS group, active 2400-pulse cTBS group, active 3600-pulse cTBS group, sham 1200-pulse cTBS group, sham 2400-pulse cTBS group, or sham 3600-pulse cTBS group. The allocation ratio will be 3:3:3:1:1:1. The stimulation protocol consisted of a 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week (totally 15 day-treatment). The stimulation procedure will be assisted with real-time neuronavigation to ensure its precision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active 1200-pulse cTBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active 1200-pulse cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: active 1200-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]},{"label":"active 2400-pulse cTBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active 2400-pulse cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: active 2400-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]},{"label":"active 3600-pulse cTBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active 3600-pulse cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: active 3600-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]},{"label":"sham 1200-pulse cTBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham 1200-pulse cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: sham 1200-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]},{"label":"sham 2400-pulse cTBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham 2400-pulse cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: sham 2400-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]},{"label":"sham 3600-pulse cTBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"sham 3600-pulse cTBS combined with speech language therapy","interventionNames":["Device: sham 3600-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active 1200-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive two 600-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by a 15-minute rest period (a total of 1200 pulses daily), for 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week.","armGroupLabels":["active 1200-pulse cTBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active 2400-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive two 1200-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by a 30-minute rest period (a total of 2400 pulses daily), for 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week.","armGroupLabels":["active 2400-pulse cTBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active 3600-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive two 1800-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by a 50-minute rest period (a total of 3600 pulses daily), for 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week.","armGroupLabels":["active 3600-pulse cTBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham 1200-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive two sham 600-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by a 15-minute rest period (a total of 1200 pulses daily), for 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week.","armGroupLabels":["sham 1200-pulse cTBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham 2400-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive two sham 1200-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by a 30-minute rest period (a total of 2400 pulses daily), for 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week.","armGroupLabels":["sham 2400-pulse cTBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham 3600-pulse continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","description":"Each patient will receive two sham 1800-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by a 50-minute rest period (a total of 3600 pulses daily), for 3-week treatment, with 5 consecutive workdays each week.","armGroupLabels":["sham 3600-pulse cTBS group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Western Aphasia Battery scores","description":"The first four subsets of the WAB (Spontaneous Speech, Auditory verbal comprehension, Repetition, Naming and word finding) will be used to evaluate the participants' language ability impairments.
