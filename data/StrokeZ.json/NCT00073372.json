There are limited studies using abciximab in the treatment of strokes. This phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of abciximab for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in helping dissolve clots in brain arteries so that blood and oxygen can flow better and there may be less brain damage.\n\nSafety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive either Abciximab: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (to a maximum of 30 mg) followed by a 0.125 µg/kg/min infusion (to a maximum of 10 µg/min) for 12 hours or a bolus of placebo followed by infusion for 12 hours"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Brain Ischemia","Acute Disease"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","abciximab","ReoPro","drug safety","drug efficacy","intracranial hemorrhage","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":808,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Abciximab"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of modified Rankin Scale responders at 3 months in the primary population."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at 3 months in the primary population.
