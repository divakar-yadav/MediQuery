Patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have short-lasting symptoms, often with remission within hours or days. Though patients experience a quick remission, they have an increased risk of a recurrent stroke and progressive cognitive dysfunction. The patients are also likely to have other disposing risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia which may increase the risk of a recurrent stroke. Following hospital discharge, the patients are offered preventive medication, but no standardized rehabilitation or exercise. Previous studies have shown that physical exercise decreases cardiovascular risk factors for patients after stroke and increases physical function and quality of life.\n\nThe aim is to develop and evaluate a standardized exercise program (a stroke school) for patients with minor stroke or TIA. The intervention consist of 6 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise at the hospital combined with patient education including knowledge on stroke risk factors. Subsequently, 6 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise in their local municipality. After the 12 weeks of exercise, patients are offered individual, motivational follow-up sessions with the purpose to facilitate the patients to stay physically active in their everyday life.\n\nThis intervention will increase the patients´ knowledge regarding risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease, increase their cardiorespiratory fitness and facilitate the patients to be physical active and hopefully slow the progression of vascular disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Minor Stroke","Non-disabling Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["Minor stroke","Stroke prevention","Physical exercise","Patient education","Cardiorespiratory fitness","Non-disabling stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"12 weeks of supervised cardiorespiratory exercise twice a week (6 weeks at the hospital and 6 weeks in the local municipality) combined with patient education and individual follow-up sessions","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Cardiorespiratory exercise combined with patient education and individual follow-up sessions"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The usual care group is encouraged to perform home-based aerobic exercise on their own"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Cardiorespiratory exercise combined with patient education and individual follow-up sessions","description":"6 weeks of cardiorespiratory exercise combined with patient education at the hospital, followed by 6 weeks of cardiorespiratory exercise in the local municipality.
