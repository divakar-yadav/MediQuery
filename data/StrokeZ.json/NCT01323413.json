The examined factors will include demographic variables such as age, gender, ethnic background, vascular risk factors and medical history, clinical parameters such as time from stroke onset until arrival to the hospital, results of neurological evaluation by NIHSS and imaging findings, laboratory tests such as body temperature, blood pressure, glucose level, renal functions etc. and imaging findings - the presence and the size of collateral blood vessels, the state of carotid arteries (by CTA). The possible correlation between all this parameters and the presence and the size of penumbra as detected by CTP will be further examined."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","penumbra","determinants","CT perfusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke","description":"acute ischemic stroke patients"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke patients hospitalized in Rambam Health Care Campus between 2008-2010, and which have underwent neurological evaluation including NIHSS scale, Brain CT, CT angio and Ct perfusion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Intracranial hemorrhage of any other brain condition","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"neurological ward","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Rambam Health Care Campus","city":"Haifa","country":"Israel","geoPoint":{"lat":32.81841,"lon":34.9885}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
