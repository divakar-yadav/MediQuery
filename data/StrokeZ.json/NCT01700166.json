To determine if Human Umbilical Cord Blood (hUCB) infusion is safe in children with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (AIS).\n2. To determine if late functional outcome, physiologic response, and anatomic findings are changed following hUCB infusion in children with perinatal AIS.","detailedDescription":"This study will enroll ten pediatric patients who have their umbilical cord blood banked with Cord Blood Registry, Inc. (CBR), who have been diagnosed with an arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), and whose caregivers contacted CBR, Inc. to notify them that the child has experienced an AIS around the time of birth.\n\nAfter receiving permission to release the patient's contact information, the CBR team will then relay the contact information to the Stem Cell Study Group at the University of Texas - Houston (UT) / Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital (CMHH) who will contact the family, explain the study, and send a consent form for their review.\n\nSeveral weeks prior to the scheduled procedure date, the patient will go to their family doctor for a physical evaluation and have blood drawn to rule out problems with the child's health.\n\nAfter successfully meeting initial pre-screening criteria, the patient's family will make their own arrangements to travel to Houston for the study procedures.\n\nOnce the patient is in Houston, he/she will undergo baseline assessments, including physical, neurological exams and tests, speech therapy testing, laboratory tests, and imaging (MRI) of the brain. If any of the blood tests are abnormal, or the patient has an active infection, the procedure may be postponed or the patient may possibly be excluded from the study.\n\nIf the patient continues to meet all criteria, the frozen cord blood will be shipped overnight to a special lab in Houston, TX for processing. Once release criteria have been met, the cells will be brought to the CMHH for infusion into the patient's vein. The patient will remain at CHMM for 24 hours of monitoring, after which they will be allowed to go home. Patients will be called daily by the research staff through Day 14, and once a month after that.\n\nPatients will return to Houston, Texas for 6 month, 1 year and 2 year follow-up visits for repeat assessments, tests, and exams just like at the baseline visit. The MRI of the brain will only be repeated at the 6 month visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS) in Children"],"keywords":["Autologous","Cord Blood","Stem Cells","Pediatric stroke","Children with ischemic stroke","Cerebral Palsy","Perinatal AIS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Biologic; Cord Blood Stem Cells; Intravenous injection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Autologous Human Umbilical Cord Blood derived Stem Cell injection","interventionNames":["Biological: Autologous Human Cord Blood derived Stem Cell injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Autologous Human Cord Blood derived Stem Cell injection","description":"One time intravenous (in the vein) injection with two year follow-up","armGroupLabels":["Biologic; Cord Blood Stem Cells; Intravenous injection"],"otherNames":["Patient's own cord blood","Patient's own stem cells"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional outcome measure","description":"Physiological (e.g., SSEP, EEG) and anatomic outcome (MRI) changes will be evaluated by repeating assessments, clinical tests and imaging exams at the pre-treatment and follow-up visits.","timeFrame":"Two years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Speech Therapy Specific Neuropsychological outcome measures","description":"Age appropriate Neurologic examinations and speech therapy specific standardized testing will be performed pre-treatment and at all follow-up visits.","timeFrame":"Two years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
