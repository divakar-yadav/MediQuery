However there is a lack of evidence evaluating the effectiveness of a nurse-led theory-based stroke self-management program among community-dwelling Chinese stroke survivors.\n\nThis is a parallel group, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to be held in a community center. All participants will be assessed at two time-points (baseline before randomization, and one month after program completion). Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either the control group (receiving usual care) or the intervention group (receiving the self-efficacy enhancing stroke self-management program). Participants in the intervention group will receive an additional assessment on usefulness of the program immediately after program completion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Disease management","Self efficacy","Quality of life","Community integration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke self-management program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The program is aimed at enhancing community-dwelling stroke survivors' post-stroke recovery.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Stroke self-management program","Behavioral: Usual care"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual care provided to stroke survivors discharged to their home.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Stroke self-management program","description":"A nurse-led community-based self-efficacy enhancing stroke self-management program.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke self-management program"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Usual care","description":"Usual care such as hospital-based or community-based health education or services.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke self-management program","Usual care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Self-efficacy in performing stroke self-management behaviors","description":"Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire","timeFrame":"One month after the program"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke self-management behaviors","description":"Stroke Self-management Behaviors Performance Scale","timeFrame":"One month after the program"},{"measure":"Health-related quality of life","description":"Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale","timeFrame":"One month after the program"},{"measure":"Depressive symptoms","description":"Geriatric Depression Scale","timeFrame":"One month after the program"},{"measure":"Community reintegration","description":"Reintegration to Normal Living Index","timeFrame":"One month after the program"},{"measure":"Outcome expectation","description":"Stroke Self-management Outcome Expectation Scale","timeFrame":"One month after the program"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Usefulness of the program","description":"Extent of overall program participation, and other qualitative comments.","timeFrame":"Within one week after the completion of the program"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* aged 18 years or above\n* have a clinical diagnosis of stroke\n* currently live at home or will be discharged from hospital to home within one week\n* have a Mini Mental State Examination score \\>18\n* speak Cantonese\n* capable of giving informed consent\n* can attend sessions of the self-efficacy enhancing stroke self-management program\n* can use a phone\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosed with transient ischemic attack, subdural or epidural hemorrhage\n* have cerebrovascular events due to presence of malignancy or head trauma\n* have limited comprehension and receptive aphasia\n* have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or dementia\n* have received a stroke self-management program in the past 12 months as reported by the participants","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Suzanne Lo","affiliation":"Queensland University of Technology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Acute public hospital 1","city":"Kowloon","country":"Hong Kong","geoPoint":{"lat":22.31667,"lon":114.18333}},{"facility":"Acute public hospital 2","city":"New Territories","country":"Hong Kong"},{"facility":"Acute public hospital 3","city":"New Territories","country":"Hong Kong"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34813082","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Crocker TF, Brown L, Lam N, Wray F, Knapp P, Forster A.
