Retention of the pattern will be tested without visual feedback immediately after learning and 24 hours later. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the control group or the exercise group. The control group will simply complete the learning task. The exercise group will complete 5 minutes of exercise immediately following the first retention test to test for the effects of exercise on retention 24 hours later.","detailedDescription":"Despite significant time and money spent on post-stroke rehabilitation, stroke survivors are left with reduced walking capacity and significant disability. After stroke, individuals must relearn movements that have been disrupted due to damage to the brain, therefore, enhancing motor learning is critical to improving the rehabilitation of walking after stroke. In this project investigators will examine how individual factors influence motor learning after stroke and use this information to personalize post-stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects will complete learning of a new walking pattern through distorted visual feedback and retention will be tested immediately after and 24 hours later (without visual feedback)."},{"label":"Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will complete learning of a new walking pattern through distorted visual feedback and retention will be tested immediately without visual feedback.
