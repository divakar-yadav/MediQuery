Sensory stimulation improves the postural symmetry of the subject transitorily and they are thought to have an effect on the spatial frame of reference through a sensory recalibration. Studies have shown that sensory stimulation by vibration of neck muscles have an immediate effect on static balance and when walking. The objective of this preliminary study is to test the long-lasting effects of repetitive neck muscle vibrations on postural disturbances in standing position and on spatial frame reference in chronic patients.","detailedDescription":"The hypothesis of this study is that the proprioceptive repeated stimulation by vibration of neck muscles in the long term improved postural asymmetry in connection with the egocentric representation of body disorders.\n\nThe effect of vibration simultaneously on improving postural asymmetry and on improving markers of the perception of the body in space (LBA, SSA, Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV), Rod and frame) will be assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Left-brain damaged chronic patients","interventionNames":["Other: Vibration sessions"]},{"label":"Right-brain damaged chronic patients","interventionNames":["Other: Vibration sessions"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Vibration sessions","description":"The patients will undergo a program of 10 sessions of vibrations of the neck muscle, each of 10 minutes, during a period of 15 days at the rate of one session per day.","armGroupLabels":["Left-brain damaged chronic patients","Right-brain damaged chronic patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes from baseline Weight Bearing Asymmetry at Day 15","description":"The primary evaluation criteria is the percentage of the Weight Bearing Asymmetry on the hemiparetic lower limb (WBA) calculated as the mean of 4 trys, each based on a 30 seconds duration with the two eyes open (OP) and then again with the two eyes closed.
