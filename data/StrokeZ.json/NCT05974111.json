Also the cross-talk between inflammation and thrombosis, so-called thrombo-inflammation is further investigated. As such the investigators aim to characterise the patient's coagulation profile before administration of any treatment. By assessing these pathways the investigators strive to detect specific markers to predict vital and functional outcome at 3 months in these patients. Finally the investigators may provide new pathophysiological insights in the course of disease following these events that can possibly improve future therapeutic strategies.","detailedDescription":"In the COADIHS trial the main objective is to map the coagulation profile, both procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways, in patients presenting with acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke.\n\nBy assessing these different pathways the investigators aim to detect possible biomarkers of coagulation with predictive value for functional and vital outcome at 3 months.\n\nIn different subgroup analyses the investigators try to answer additional research questions as posed by the specific pathophysiology.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nMapping the coagulation profile of both procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways together with markers of inflammation and ischemia in patients presenting with all types of acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, at presentation and during first 7 days of clinical course in order to detect biochemical markers with predictive value of vital and functional outcome at 3 months.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\n* Detection of culprit underlying thrombophilia in cryptogenic stroke and evaluation of their effect on clinical course and outcome (recurrent stroke).\n* Evaluating the interaction between the coagulation profile and pre-stroke medication that works on coagulation pathways.\n* To investigate the role of platelets and platelet activation in different pathophysiological mechanisms described in development of delayed cerebral ischemia following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH)(microvessel constriction, thromboinflammation, large artery vasospasm, cortical spreading depolarization)\n* To evaluate the role of haemostatic derangements following aSAH as biomarker to predict delayed cerebral ischemia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Haemorrhagic Stroke","Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood samples stored in biobank for full coagulation testing.
