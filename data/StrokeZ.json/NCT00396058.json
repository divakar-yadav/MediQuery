TMS will be used to demonstrate changes in cortical excitability (motor threshold) and intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The effect of methylphenidate on baseline TMS measures will be evaluated as well as the effect on training induced changes in TMS measures (by comparing baseline and posttraining measures). The patients will be trained on two separate occasions, to compare the effect of Methylphenidate to placebo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Methylphenidate"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Training induced changes in Short interval Intracortical Inhibition (SICI)."},{"measure":"Training induced changes in Intracortical facilitation (ICF)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Baseline SICI, ICF, and motor threshold compared between methylphenidate and Placebo"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Less than two months after first stroke.\n* Moderate to light hand paralysis\n* Measurable MEP in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle\n* Able to read and understand the written information\n* Signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Epilepsy\n* Glaucoma\n* Hyperthyroidism\n* Cardiac arrythmia\n* Known heart disease or angina.\n* Metal implants\n* Pacemaker\n* Pregnancy\n* Diastolic BP\\>100 mmHg\n* In treatment with MAO-inhibitor, SSRIs og Ritalin","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jakob U Blicher, MD","affiliation":"Hammel neurocenter Aarhus University Hospital Denmark","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of neurology","city":"Aarhus","zip":"8000","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":56.15674,"lon":10.21076}},{"facility":"Hammel neurocenter","city":"Hammel","zip":"8450","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":56.25762,"lon":9.86316}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000008774","term":"Methylphenidate"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000000697","term":"Central Nervous System Stimulants"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"},{"id":"D000018765","term":"Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000014179","term":"Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000049990","term":"Membrane Transport Modulators"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"},{"id":"D000015259","term":"Dopamine Agents"},{"id":"D000018377","term":"Neurotransmitter Agents"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M11438","name":"Methylphenidate","asFound":"TENS","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M3719","name":"Central Nervous System Stimulants","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7163","name":"Dopamine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20522","name":"Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17652","name":"Dopamine Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20194","name":"Neurotransmitter Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSSti","name":"Central Nervous System Stimulants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"CaAg","name":"Cardiotonic Agents"}]}},"hasResults":false}
