Participants were randomly assigned to receive twice per week, for a total of 2 weeks' training with visual cues (control group) or without (experimental group). It was hypothesized that the experimental group would be able to place the foot closer to the target when stepping and have more symmetrical gait. So far, 22 stroke patients completed the experiment. Preliminary results support the hypothesis. This project is still ongoing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spatial Perception","Stroke","Virtual Reality","Exercise Training","Exproprioception"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non-visual exproprioception training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The training requires the participant to place the foot at a target without visual cues of the foot in virtual environment.","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual reality foot placement training"]},{"label":"Visual exproprioception group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The training requires the participant to place the foot at a target with visual cues of the foot in virtual environment.","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual reality foot placement training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual reality foot placement training","description":"The training is conducted in sitting and standing, and involves both the affected and unaffected foot placement.
