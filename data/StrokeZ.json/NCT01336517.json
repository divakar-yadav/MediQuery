The evaluation will consist of several tests that will evaluate movement, tightness, balance and sensation in affected leg.","detailedDescription":"To comprehensively evaluate the effect of an AFO on ambulatory function and loading in hemiplegic gait. This study is addressing important questions regarding the effect of an AFO on gait and introduces technology for quantifiable objective assessment of AFO effectiveness. It will attempt to identify if AFO wear compliance increases community ambulation and walking efficiency bilaterally. Research is needed to fully understand how compliance affects mobility outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia, Spastic"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","AFO","Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Between the ages of 18 and 75\n* Have sustained a stroke at least 6 months prior to study enrollment\n* Use a prescribed custom brace while walking\n* Have no history of injury, orthopedic or other medical problem in the normal leg\n* Be able to walk independently or with close supervision for 25 feet without a brace or cane\n* Wear shoes sizes 5 1/2 - 11 US womens or size 6-13 US mens\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Orthopedic problems or history that will interfere with walking or limit the range of motion of legs\n* Neurological illness, history, or conditions that my interfere with walking except for stroke\n* Psychiatric conditions or history that would interfere with the ability to walk or follow directions\n* Serious lung or heart condition that could severely limit the ability to walk","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Participants with a history of hemiplegia secondary to stroke, between the ages of 18 and 75, who are greater than 6 months post and have been prescribed a custom molded AFO for assistance with gait deviations","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Karen Nolan, Ph.D.","affiliation":"Kessler Foundation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kessler Foundation Research Center","city":"West Orange","state":"New Jersey","zip":"07052","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.79871,"lon":-74.23904}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006429","term":"Hemiplegia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000010243","term":"Paralysis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","asFound":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11775","name":"Muscle Spasticity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12847","name":"Paralysis","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
