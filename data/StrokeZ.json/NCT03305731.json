This may lead to recurrent stroke. Subtle cognitive impairments are common after stroke and can lead to difficulty self-monitoring and problem solving to overcome barriers to physical activity. Investigators developed the Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) intervention to promote activity scheduling, self-monitoring, and problem solving activity over the full day. This study examines the effects of the ABLE intervention on sedentary behavior after stroke.","detailedDescription":"The study advisory committee added a dose-matched, no-intervention delayed baseline to the study protocol following initial documentation of this study protocol on clinicaltrials.gov. The purpose of this delayed baseline design was to assess the baseline stability on the primary and secondary outcomes. The addition of this timepoint resulted in a shift of post-intervention timepoints as follows: Baseline 1 (week 1), Baseline 2 (week 6), Post-intervention (week 11), and Follow-up (week 18). Intervention was delivered between Baseline 2 and Post-intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Physical Activity","Sedentary Lifestyle","Behavior, Health","Physical Disability"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will engage in the ABLE intervention.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement","description":"Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) is a behavioral intervention in which participants learn skills to schedule, self-monitor, and problem solve strategies to overcome barriers to engagement in meaningful daily life activities.","armGroupLabels":["Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Daily Sedentary Time Accumulated in Bouts Greater Than or Equal to 30 Minutes","description":"Objectively measured sedentary time (ActivPAL)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Baseline=computed mean of week 1 and week 6) to 11 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Daily Number of Sedentary Breaks","description":"Objectively measured sedentary breaks (ActivPAL)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Baseline=computed mean of week 1 and week 6) to 11 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Daily Number of Sedentary Breaks","description":"Objectively measured sedentary breaks (ActivPAL)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Baseline=computed mean of week 1 and week 6) to 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Daily Sedentary Time Accumulated in Bouts Greater Than or Equal to 30 Minutes","description":"Objectively measured sedentary time (ActivPAL)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Baseline=computed mean of week 1 and week 6) to 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Participation","description":"Client rated participation in meaningful daily life activities using the Stroke Impact Scale - Participation Subscale\n\nThe Stroke Impact Scale - Participation Subscale is a questionnaire-based measure of community participation.
