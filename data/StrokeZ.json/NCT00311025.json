It has been shown that intensive stroke unit care and functional exercises are beneficial in the acute rehabilitation of stroke. The duration of the rehabilitation of patients with acute stroke is decreasing, leaving patients with not complete recovery at discharge in need of follow-up services. There is a general assumption that physical exercises are beneficial at all stages of stroke but it is questionable if these benefits are sustained after treatment ends. There are, to our knowledge, no longitudinal studies of non-interrupted regular physical exercises from the acute phase till one year post stroke.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to follow first-ever- acute stroke patients from onset, one, two and four years post stroke. All acute stroke patients will be treated in a stroke unit and the physiotherapy treatment will be according to Motor Relearning Programme principles with functional goals, environmental context and early mobilisation. When patients are discharged they will be block randomised and stratified according to gender and hemisphere lesion into two groups. Group 1 will be offered an intensive follow-up programme, which will run four times in the post-stroke year with a total amount of 80 hours of physiotherapy. The physiotherapy treatment will be focused on physical endurance, strength and balance.\n\nGroup 2, or the control group, will be offered the same physiotherapy programme that is practised within the community as of now (2003) that is when the need for follow-up is considered by someone involved. The physiotherapy then given is according to specified needs e.g. walking capacity, transfers and assistive devices."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","physical therapy","rehabilitation","exercise","longterm follow-up"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"ECT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"intensive endurance, strength and balance exercises"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Assessment Scale"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Bergs Balance Scale,"},{"measure":"Timed-Up-and-Go,"},{"measure":"6 minute walk test,"},{"measure":"Nottingham Health Profile,"},{"measure":"Martin Vigorimeter,"},{"measure":"Ashworth Scale,"},{"measure":"Barthel ADL index,"},{"measure":"Fillenbaum´s I-ADL,"},{"measure":"blood pressure,"},{"measure":"heart rate"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* First-time ever stroke\n* Neurological signs\n* Computer tomography confirmed stroke\n* Voluntary participation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subarachnoid bleeding\n* Tumour\n* Other serious illness\n* Brain stem or cerebellum stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"0 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Birgitta M Langhammer, phd student","affiliation":"Oslo University College","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sykehuset Asker og Bærum HF, Postboks 83,","city":"Rud","zip":"1309","country":"Norway"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11997","name":"Neoplasm Metastasis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
