It is a pencil and paper, timed test. Completion time in seconds for each task is recorded, with a lower score representing better function. Change in attention will be calculated by subtracting the time to do the task at baseline from the time to do the task at 3 months.","timeFrame":"Baseline to 3 months"},{"measure":"Change in executive function as measured by the Color Trail Test 2","description":"This measure assesses divided attention and sequencing skills, which are executive function performance. It is a pencil and paper, timed test of effortful executive processing abilities that assesses the ability to alternate between two colors. Completion time in seconds for each task is recorded, with a lower score representing better function. Change in executive function will be calculated by subtracting the time to do the task at baseline from the time to do the task at 3 months.","timeFrame":"Baseline to 3 months"},{"measure":"Change in community participation as measure by Community Participation Indicators score","description":"This participant reported questionnaire will measure the frequency of community participation over a 7 days period. Each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1=no participation in that activity and 5=7 days of participation in that activity. A total of 20 items are summed to yield a total score.
