Patients who were eligible to the inclusion criteria and ineligible to the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into two groups by a 1:1 ratio after the ICF was received. Patients in one arm will be given 15 ml edaravone and dexborneol concentrated solution for injection (37.5 mg, containing edaravone 30 mg and dexborneol 7.5 mg) twice a day for 10-14 days, and those in the other arm will be given an equivalent placebo drug. All patients will be followed up for 90 days. The primary outcome is the proportion of modified Rankin Scale 0-2 and the safety outcome is the proportion of severe adverse events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Mechanical Thrombectomy","Edaravone Dexborneol","Phase III"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1362,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Edaravone Dexborneol group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this arm will be given Edaravone Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for injection twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Edaravone Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for injection"]},{"label":"Edaravone Dexborneol Placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this arm will be given a placebo of Edaravone Dexborneol for injection twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Edaravone Dexborneol placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edaravone Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for injection","description":"Edaravone and Dexborneol Concentrated Solution for Injection, 15 ml (37.5 mg, containing edaravone 30 mg and dexborneol 7.5 mg) in 3 ampoule bottles, twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Edaravone Dexborneol group"],"otherNames":["Xian Bi Xin, CFDA Approval Number H20200007"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edaravone Dexborneol placebo","description":"Edaravone and Dexborneol placebo, 15 ml in 3 ampoule bottles, twice a day for 10 to 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Edaravone Dexborneol Placebo group"],"otherNames":["Xian Bi Xin placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Favorable functional outcome","description":"Rate of favorable functional outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS, scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 to 2 indicating favorable outcome and 3 to 6 indicating unfavorable outcome including 6 as death) score of 0-2","timeFrame":"at 90 days after randomization"},{"measure":"Incidence of severe adverse event (Safety outcome)","description":"The incidence of Severe Adverse Event (SAE) emerged during the whole study period","timeFrame":"at 90 days after randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Excellent functional outcome","description":"Rate of excellent functional outcome defined as a mRS score 0-1","timeFrame":"at 90 days after randomization"},{"measure":"NIHSS score change","description":"The change of NIHSS score defined as the NIHSS score of day 10-14 minus that of baseline","timeFrame":"at 10-14 days after randomization"},{"measure":"NIHSS score decreases ≥4","description":"Defined as the proportion of patients with NIHSS score decrease ≥ 4 from day 10-14 to baseline","timeFrame":"at 10-14 days after randomization"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality","description":"All-cause mortality at 90 days after randomization","timeFrame":"at 90 days after randomization"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)","description":"The proportion of patients who experienced sICH","timeFrame":"at 24-36 hours after randomization"},{"measure":"Neurological deterioration","description":"Defined as the NIHSS score increases ≥4 from day 1 to baseline","timeFrame":"at day 1 after randomization"},{"measure":"Stroke recurrence","description":"Defined as a new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke occurred within 90 days after randomization","timeFrame":"within 90 days after randomization"},{"measure":"Adverse events (AE)","description":"The proportion of patients who experienced AE","timeFrame":"within 90 days after randomization"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18 - 80 years, male or female;\n2.
