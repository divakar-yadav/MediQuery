Misdiagnosing the presence of LAA thrombus can lead to unnecessarily cancelled procedures (cardioversion and atrial fibrillation ablation) and potentially hazardous, unnecessary changes in clinical care (such as prolonged Coumadin anticoagulation). Missing LAA thrombus can result in continuation of cardioversion or atrial fibrillation ablation procedures at a time when there is higher risk of subsequent embolic stroke.\n\nSeveral of the patients with atrial fibrillation require transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed prior to cardioversion or atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. There is opportunity to enroll most of these patients in our proposed study. There has been essentially no work published about the use of echo contrast materials in TEE (other than agitated saline), particularly the use of Optison. Thus, the investigators will be exploring a new field in echocardiography and echo contrast."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","stroke","TEE","Left atrial thrombus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Echo arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects with atrial fibrillation who are undergoing a TEE procedure will be assessed using Optison echocardiography contrast agent","interventionNames":["Drug: Optison echocardiography contrast agent"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Optison echocardiography contrast agent","description":"Subjects undergoing transesophageal echocardiography who will receive the Optison contrast agent during the procedure to test if the image quality improves to provide accurate assessment of the presence of left atrial thrombus.","armGroupLabels":["Echo arm"],"otherNames":["Perflutren Protein-Type A microspheres"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percent Confidence in Assessment of Left Atrial Appendage Thrombus","description":"Confidence among echo readers to determine presence or absence of left atrial appendage thrombus before and after injection of Optison contrast agent.
