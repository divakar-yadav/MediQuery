beds or caries dentium) within 4 weeks prior to baseline.\n* History of diverticulitis that, in the Investigator's opinion, may lead to increased risk of complications such as lower gastrointestinal perforation.\n* Evidence of active or untreated latent tuberculosis (TB; excluding patients receiving chemoprophylaxis for latent TB infection).\n* Evidence of active interstitial lung disease\n* Receipt of any live or live attenuated vaccine within 6 weeks prior to baseline and throughout the duration of the study.\n* History of malignancy within the last 5 years, including solid tumors,

judgment\n* Poor peripheral venous access\n* Serious infection requiring oral or IV antibiotics prior to screening\n* Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study\n* History or presence of an abnormal ECG that is clinically significant in the investigator's opinion, including complete left bundle branch block, second- or third degree atrioventricular heart block, or evidence of prior myocardial infarction","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"89 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Brian Hoh,
