Botulinum toxin(BT-A) injection will be applied to the study group(n=16) and placebo injection to the control group(n=15) in addition to conventional rehabilitation and stretching exercises. Evaluations will be made before the treatment, in the 2nd week, and in 3rd month after the treatment. Pain relief will be evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale(VAS) and spasticity assessment will be done with the Modified Ashworth Scale(MAS). The functionality will be evaluated with Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale(FMAS) and Box Block Test(BBT)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Spasticity, Muscle","Botulinum Toxin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This is the group that will be injected with botulinum toxin for spasticity and stretching exercises will be given.","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin type A"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"This is the group that will be injected with %0,9 NaCl for spasticity and stretching exercises will be given.","interventionNames":["Drug: %0,9 NaCl"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum toxin type A","description":"Toxin of Clostridium Botulinum","armGroupLabels":["Study Group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"%0,9 NaCl","description":"%0,9 NaCl","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pain - Visual Analog Scale","description":"The shoulder pain of the patients will be evaluated during passive movement of the shoulder joint.
