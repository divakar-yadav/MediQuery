Half of all individuals with ischemic stroke do not regain lost body functions until the end of life. Individuals with ischemic stroke are most likely to have impaired cognitive, sensory, and motor functions, but the greatest challenge for health care professionals is impaired motor skills caused by motor nerve cell damage. In order to minimize the degree of disability, it is important to respond quickly to a person's condition. Because it has been shown that lost functions can be taken over by adjacent, non-stroke-affected areas of the cerebral cortex, early rehabilitation is a key factor that can help prevent function limitation by acting in conjunction with spontaneous recovery of body function.\n\nThe aim of the study is to assess the effect or ordinary and differential learning based physiotherapy for torso control, balance and gait on subjects with ischemic stroke in the second phase of rehabilitation.\n\nThe study was approved by Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of Kaunas Region (2020-06-30 No.BEC-KN(B)-263)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participants were divided into intervention group and control group.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention group (n=10) received differential learning based physiotherapy program: 3 times a week ordinary physiotherapy, 2 times a week differential learning based on physiotherapy, total 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: Intervention group"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group (n=10) received ordinary physiotherapy program 5 times a week, total 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intervention group","description":"Differential learning based physiotherapy to improve torso control, balance and gait","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"Ordinary physiotherapy program","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Torso control assessment scale","description":"The torso control rating scale evaluates torso functions in a variety of locations, whether standing, sitting or performing a mobility assessment task.
