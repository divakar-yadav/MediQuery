To date, the role of DTI-guided minimally invasive hematoma evacuation in ICH is still uncertain.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial, as well as a concurrent prospective observational study including all ICH patients who decline participation in the trial and will therefore receive minimally invasive hematoma evacuation or best medical therapy and consent to be followed up. All participants will be followed up at the same time using the same outcomes measures. The primary outcome will be collected by a blinded assessor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Minimally Invasive Hematoma Evacuation","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Randomized Controlled Trial","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Other design features: The investigators will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial, as well as a concurrent prospective observational study including all ICH patients who decline participation in the trial and will therefore receive minimally invasive hematoma evacuation or best medical therapy and consent to be followed up.

The amount of bleeding is 20-40ml, and the midline structure is displaced horizontally by \\< 3mm in the pineal gland;\n4. The degree of integrity and continuity of the corticospinal tract on the lesion side of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was graded as grade 2\\~4;\n5. The time from onset to randomization is within 24 hours;\n6. GCS score ≥ 4 points at randomization;\n7. Muscle strength level 3 in the affected limb;\n8. Written informed consent are provided by the patients or their legal representatives.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Bleeding in other parts (e.g., bleeding in subtentorial areas such as thalamus, brainstem or cerebellum);\n2. Bleeding caused by other causes (such as aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumor, bleeding transformation of large cerebral infarction, bleeding caused by β amyloidosis, bleeding caused by coagulation dysfunction) or combined with aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumor, large-scale cerebral infarction, β amyloidosis, severe coagulation dysfunction;\n3. Multiple intracranial hemorrhage;\n4. Patients with ventricular hemorrhage or ICH rupture into the ventricles should consider the need for ventricular drainage;\n5. Any history of brain parenchymal or other intracranial subarachnoid, subdural or epidural hemorrhage and surgical history in the past 30 days;\n6. Myocardial infarction within the past 30 days;\n7. Previous history of bleeding, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, genitourinary bleeding, respiratory bleeding that has not been completely controlled;\n8.
