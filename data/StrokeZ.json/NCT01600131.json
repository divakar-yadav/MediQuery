The immediate objective is to test, using a randomized controlled trial, a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered during the transitional care period (e.g., time which Veteran is discharged to home) followed by online, in-home sessions. The investigators will modify the traditional, problem-solving intervention by adding web-based training using interactive modules, factsheets, and tools on previously developed and nationally available RESCUE Caregiver website (www.cidrr8.research.va.gov/rescue). The investigators will also provide on-line, skills training and application of the problem-solving approach via the RESCUE messaging center. The immediate, primary aim (#1) is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #2 is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' burden, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and satisfaction with care at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #3 is to test the effect of the intervention on Veterans' outcomes: functional abilities and healthcare utilization (i.e., unintended hospital bed days of care, number of emergency room visits, number of unscheduled clinic visits) at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #4 is to determine the budgetary impact for implementing the intervention. Aim #5 is to determine the facilitators, barriers and best practices for implementing the intervention.\n\nDesign and Methods:\n\nThe investigators will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial. The investigators will enroll 240 stroke caregivers at 8 study sites (North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Healthcare System, Miami VA Healthcare System, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa, Michael E. Debakey VAMC in Houston, Hunter Holmes McGuire VAMC in Richmond, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, and the VA Boston Healthcare System). Eligible caregivers will be interviewed, complete baseline measures, and then be randomized to two groups: 1) intervention group, or 2) standard care. A team member will telephone caregivers at 11 weeks and 19 weeks after baseline data collection to answer questions on instruments with established reliability and validity. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with selected caregivers to obtain in-depth perceptions of the value, facilitators, and barriers of the intervention.\n\nImpact:\n\nThis is the first known study to test a transition-to-home intervention combined with technology to improve the quality of caregiving and the recovery of Veterans.","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nCaregiver depression is common following a family member's stroke and is a major contributor of survivor's hospital readmission and institutionalization. Researchers have consistently found that interventions to help caregivers resolve problems are effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, these problem-solving interventions have been underused in practice because they involve multiple, in-person or telephone sessions and require large amounts of staff time to implement. To overcome these barriers, the long-term goal is to implement stroke caregiver programs that involve low-cost interventions that are sustainable in routine clinical practice. The immediate objective is to test, using a randomized controlled trial, a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered shortly after the Veterans' in-patient stays followed by online, in-home sessions. The investigators will modify the traditional, problem-solving intervention by adding web-based training using interactive modules, factsheets, and tools on previously developed and nationally available RESCUE Caregiver website (www.cidrr8.research.va.gov/rescue). The investigators will also provide on-line, skills training and application of the problem-solving approach via the RESCUE messaging center, a secure site behind the VA firewall. This work builds on the team's extensive experience in stroke caregiver education.\n\nThe immediate, primary aim (#1) is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Primary Hypothesis: Stroke caregivers who receive the intervention will have less depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection compared to stroke caregivers who receive standard care. The investigators propose four secondary aims. Aim #2 is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' burden, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and satisfaction with care at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #3 is to test the effect of the intervention on Veterans' outcomes: functional abilities and healthcare utilization (i.e., unintended hospital bed days of care, number of emergency room visits, number of unscheduled clinic visits) at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #4 is to determine the budgetary impact for implementing the intervention. Aim #5 is to determine the facilitators, barriers and best practices for implementing the intervention.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe investigators will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial with repeated measures and use mixed methods to determine caregivers' perceptions of the intervention. The investigators will enroll 240 stroke caregivers at 8 study sites (North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Healthcare System, Miami VA Healthcare System, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa, Michael E. Debakey VAMC in Houston, Hunter Holmes McGuire VAMC in Richmond, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, and the VA Boston Healthcare System). Eligible caregivers will be interviewed, complete baseline measures, and then be randomized to two groups: 1) intervention group, or 2) standard care. A study team member will telephone caregivers at 11 weeks and 19 weeks after baseline data collection to answer questions on instruments with established reliability and validity. The team member will review the Veterans' VA Computerized Patient Record System health record to obtain information on the Veterans' healthcare utilization. The investigators will determine the budgetary impact of the intervention by examining the cost data in the VA Managerial Cost Accounting System (MCAS) (formerly DSS) National Data Extracts and Non-VA Medical Care files. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with selected caregivers to obtain in-depth perceptions of the value, facilitators, and barriers of the intervention. Throughout all phases of the project, the investigators will collaborate with VA (Offices of Nursing Service and Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care.\n\nImpact:\n\nThis is the first known study to test transition-to-home intervention combined with technology to improve the quality of caregiving and the recovery of Veterans. Other outcomes will be a state-of-the-art website and an evidence-based model (in-patient, discharge planning and online, training and caregiver-provider messaging) that can be transportable to other disease models"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression","Quality of Life","Self Efficacy","Recovery of Function","Stress","Positive Aspects of Caregiving"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":174,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Caregiver education and support","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered shortly after the Veteran's in-patient stays followed by online, in-home sessions.
