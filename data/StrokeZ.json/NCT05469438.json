The investigator will test IMAS in 30 acute stroke subjects; and extract quantitative movement kinematic/kinetic metrics descriptive of subjects' motor behavior (e.g., arm movement speed, smoothness). Subjects will undergo a series of upper limb focused assessments including Fugl Meyer, Barthel Index, and Orpington Prognostic Scale assessments.

Presence of upper limb weakness per the NIHSS (1-2 points in the arm) and ability to perform testing (i.e. NIHSS motor score 1-2 at elbow, wrist, and finger flexion extension). (Note that individuals with a prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with available information pertaining superior extremity baseline strength after their previous stroke would qualify).\n6. Baseline Modified Rankin score \\<4.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months as self-reported;\n2. History of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, other psychosis, bipolar illness, alcohol/drug abuse within the past year;\n3. Need for rapid clinical response due to conditions such as initiation, psychosis, or suicidality;\n4. Unstable medical conditions (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, uncompensated cardiac issues, heart failure, pulmonary issues, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease);\n5. History of dementia per relative/ medical records.\n6. Presence of receptive aphasia at baseline or after the current acute stroke.\n7. Amputated limbs.\n8. Absence of weakness as per the NIHSS (0 points = no drift for motor arm and leg items) or severe motor impairment NIHSS 4 points for motor arm).\n9.
