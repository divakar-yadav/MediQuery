In 2018, another prospective multicenter RCT supported the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of EVT in addition to intra-arterial tenecteplase compared to EVT alone, in patients with large vessel occlusion of posterior circulation, on functional and safety outcomes.\n\nStudy design: This is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial of EVT with IA-TNK versus EVT. The trial has observer blind assessment of the primary outcome and of neuro-imaging at baseline and follow-up.\n\nStudy population: Patients with acute intracranial large vessel occlusion of posterior circulation and an eTICI 2b-3 after EVT.\n\nMain study parameters/outcomes: The primary effect parameter will be excellent functional status at day 90 defined as a modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0-1. The estimate will be adjusted for the known prognostic variables age, pre-stroke mRS, time from onset to randomization, stroke severity (NIHSS) and collaterals and adjusted and unadjusted estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Intracranial Artery Occlusion","Endovascular Thrombectomy"],"keywords":["thrombectomy","endovascular treatment","mechanical thrombectomy techniques","tenecteplase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":208,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"endovascular thrombectomy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"For patients randomized to the control group, EVT has to be completed within 24 hours of stroke onset.
