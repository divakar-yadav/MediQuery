In this study, we will compare two mobilisation strategies: early versus delayed \"verticalisation\". 400 ischemic stroke patients will be included in this prospective randomized controlled trial, equally distributed in two groups. In the early mobilisation procedure the patient is allowed to go and sit outside of the bed the day after the stroke onset, whereas in the other arm, this procedure is delayed to the third day after stroke onset. The outcome in both groups will be assessed by the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months, which is commonly used in stroke study to investigate the functional outcome of the patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Early Mobilisation in Ischemic Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["Cerebral Infarction, Mobilization, Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":167,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early vertical positioning","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Mobilization of stroke patients"]},{"label":"Progressively vertical positioning","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Mobilization of stroke patients"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mobilization of stroke patients","description":"In the first group (early vertical positioning)the patient can sit outside of the bed, the day after stroke onset.
