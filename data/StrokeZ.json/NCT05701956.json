The EXTEND-IA TNK trial demonstrated that intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase is superior to alteplase before EVT for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes. However, it is unclear whether intravenous tenecteplase bridging with EVT is superior to EVT alone in the extended window patients with basilar artery occlusion. Therefore, additional studies are needed to explore the potential benefit of intravenous tenecteplase in these patients.\n\nStudy design: Multicenter, prospective, controlled clinical trial with open-label treatment and blind outcome assessment (PROBE) of intravenous tenecteplase plus EVT versus EVT alone. The trial has observer blinded assessment of the primary outcome and neuroimaging at baseline and follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basilar Artery Occlusion","Acute Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke Due to Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["Thrombectomy","Tenecteplase","Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":332,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intravenous tenecteplase+endovascular thrombectomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, max 25mg) plus endovascular thrombectomy.","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase","Procedure: Endovascular thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Endovascular thrombectomy alone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive endovascular thrombectomy alone.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Patients will receive intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg, administered as a bolus over 5-10 seconds) before endovascular thrombectomy","armGroupLabels":["Intravenous tenecteplase+endovascular thrombectomy"],"otherNames":["TNK","TNK-tPA","TNKase","rhTNK-tPA"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular thrombectomy","description":"The choice of endovascular thrombectomy strategy will be made by the treating neurointerventionist.
