According to current data efficiency and safety of this approach at least comparable with pharmacological prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.\n\nHowever, to date, LAA occluder implantation is not recommended as an alternative for conservative therapy and reserved for patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulants only. In the same time, long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in clinical trials and data from registries showed that LAA occlude device implantation as an alternative to oral anticoagulation could reduce drug load, decrease complexity and cost of treatment and thus improve patients' quality of life, and potentially may reduce the risk of death. The aim of our study is to investigate the risk of all-cause death, stroke, and bleedings in patients with LAA occluder implanted as an alternative to anticoagulant therapy.\n\nThree hundred patients with atrial fibrillation will undergo LAA occluder implantation. For LAA occluder sizing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), CT and LAA angiography will be performed. The follow-up period will be 36 months. The incidence of all-cause death, stroke, bleeding BARC≥2, device-related complications and QOL will be investigated.\n\nThe patients will be followed in the clinic at three and six months, and then at 12, 24 and 36 months, the telephone calls for getting information about endpoints events will be done. Additional in clinic visits will be scheduled if the late complications will be suspected.\n\nTEE will be performed at three and six months to check for device leak, displacement and thrombosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["left atrial appendage","LAA occluder","thromboembolic prophylaxis","atrial fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"left atrial appendage occluder implantation","description":"all patients will get implantation of LAA occluder"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of patients with Composite of death, stroke, clinically significant bleeding event (>_2 class according to BARC criteria), device leak, device displacement or device thrombosis with the first event for a given patient is taken into account","description":"a clinically significant bleeding event is \\>_2 class according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria bleeding","timeFrame":"36 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"device thrombosis during first 6 months","description":"device thrombosis detected by transesophageal echocardiography during first 6 months of follow-up","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"device dislocation","description":"number of patients who would have device dislocation","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"any bleed","description":"total number of patients who would have any bleeding event","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"bleeding BARC ≥2","description":"total number of patients who would have bleeding event with the grade BARC ≥2","timeFrame":"36 months"},{"measure":"device leak and displacement during first 6 months","description":"device leak detected by transesophageal echocardiography during first 6 months after implantation or device displacement during the same time period","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"any adverse events during 7 days after LAA occluder implantation","description":"any adverse events related to the device implantation during the first 7 days after implantation","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"change in QOL SF 36 between baseline and final visit","description":"change in quality of life (QOL) by Short Form (SF) 36 Health Survey between baseline and follow-up visits\n\nSF 36 is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health.
