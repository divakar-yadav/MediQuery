The doctor will rate the severity of patients' cognitive impairments on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, assess their performance in activities of daily living on the Barthel Index scale \\[Collin C, Wade DT, Davies S, Horne V. \"The Barthel ADL Index: a reliability study.\" Int Disability Study.1988;10:61-63.\\], and administer the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) questionnaire \\[Williams LS, Weinberger M, Harris LE, Clark DO, Biller J. Development of a stroke-specific quality of life scale. Stroke 1999 Jul;30(7):1362-9\\]. Eligible participants will have to have moderate cognitive impairments (MMSE score - at least 21 and MoCA - less than 26). Therapy received by patients for their co-morbidities and primary diagnosis will be recorded. All women of childbearing potential will be administered pregnancy tests.\n\nIf a patient meets all inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion criteria at Visit 1, he/she is randomized to one of the two groups: group 1 will receive MMH-MAP at 2 tablets twice daily; group 2 will receive Placebo using the study product dosing regimen. The total duration of follow-up and treatment will be 28 weeks, which will include 5 additional visits.\n\nAt Visit 2 (Week 4±7 days), the doctor records patients' complaints and physical examination data, reviews the progress of study and basic and concomitant therapy, and assesses treatment safety and patient compliance with treatment.\n\nAt Visit 3 (Week 8±7 days), Visit 4 (Week 16±7 days), and Visit 5 (Week 24±7 days), the doctor assesses patients' cognitive impairments (MoCA) and performance in activities of daily living (the Barthel Index). The patients complete the SS-QOL questionnaire.\n\nAt Visit 5 (Week 24±7 days), the doctor will additionally complete the Clinical Global Impression Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) scale \\[Guy W, editor. ECDEU Assessment Manual for Psychopharmacology. 1976 Rockville, MD, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\\] and collect samples for laboratory testing. The patient stops taking the study drug.\n\nAfter four weeks following the end of study therapy patients complete a follow-up visit -Visit 6 (Week 28±7 days). The patients are interviewed for complaints and undergo physical examination, with a check on their concomitant and primary therapies as well as on the safety of study treatment. The doctor assesses patients' cognitive impairments (MoCA) and performance in activities of daily living (the Barthel Index) and administers the SS-QOL questionnaire.\n\nThe total length of the observation period will be 28 weeks. During the study, symptomatic therapy and therapy for underlying chronic conditions are allowed with the exception of the drugs indicated in the section \"Prohibited Concomitant Treatment\"."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mild Cognitive Impairment","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":276,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MMH-MAP","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tablet for oral use.
