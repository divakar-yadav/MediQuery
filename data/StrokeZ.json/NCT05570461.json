The purpose of this test is to enumerate upper limb motor ability through a series of functional tasks. The WMFT is an instrument with high internal consistency, interrater reliability and test-retest reliability. The quality of movement during the task is measured by functional ability scale, a 6-point ordinal scale, where 0 = does not attempt with the impaired arm and 5 = arm movement appear to be normal.\n\nHigher the value higher will be the normal function.","timeFrame":"4weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.
