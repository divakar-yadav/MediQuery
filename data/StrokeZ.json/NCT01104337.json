The question remaining to be dealt with is whether this in vitro observation can explain the in vivo paracetamol-warfarin interaction. We aim to evaluate the effect of paracetamol at the most widely used doses 2 and 3g/day on INR in stable patients treated with warfarin in a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial and to identify the mechanism involved in this interaction in vivo."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Deep Venous Thrombosis","Pulmonary Embolism","Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Antiphospholipid
