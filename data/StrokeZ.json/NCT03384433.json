In this study we aim to assay the administration of MSC derived exosome on improvement of disability of patients with acute ischemic stroke","detailedDescription":"Exosomes derived from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promote neurovascular remodeling and functional recovery after stroke. Animal study has shown that Exosome treatment markedly increased the number of newly formed doublecortin (a marker of neuroblasts) and von Willebrand factor (a marker of endothelial cells) cells. Based on previous literature, intravenous administration of MSC-generated exosomes post stroke improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis and represents a novel treatment for stroke. Also some studies have presented which miR-124-Loaded Exosomes ameliorate the brain Injury by promoting neurogenesis. So in present study we aim to assess improving patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MSC derived exosome"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"exosome or vesicle","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CVA patients who have disability, will receive total protein of allogenic MSC-generated exosome transfected by miR-124, one month after attack, via Stereotaxis/Intraparanchymal","interventionNames":["Biological: exosome"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"exosome","description":"allogenic mesenchymal stem cells derived exosome enriched by miR-124","armGroupLabels":["exosome or vesicle"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events","description":"deteriorating stroke, stroke recurrences, brain oedema, seizures, hemorrhagic transformation","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"measurement of Modified Ranking Scale","description":"measure the degree of disability in Stroke patients. score was recorded from 0-6.\n\n0 No symptoms at all\n\n1.
