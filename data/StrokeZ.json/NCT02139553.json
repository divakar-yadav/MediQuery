Based on our results we hope to be able to answer a fundamental question: are rhythmic and discrete movements two independent primitives?","detailedDescription":"Patients are assessed four times during this longitudinal study. One month separates the first two assessment, next patients are trained 12 times during one month with rhythmic movement training on an end-effector robot. After this month, patients are assessed a third time and three months later a fourth time in order to study long-time benefits of the therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke"],"keywords":["Rhythmic versus discrete movements","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rhythmic rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo a first evaluation, and a second evaluation one month later to determine their natural evolution.
