The hypothesis is that treatment with modafinil positively will affect behavioural and cognitive rehabilitation after stroke, causing the treatment group to experience decreased fatigue, increased endurance, improved skills of sustaining attention and faster reaction times. The cognitive rehabilitation will show in increased muscle mass, decreased osteoporosis and better physical performances due to a higher level of physical activity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Post Stroke Fatigue"],"keywords":["stroke","fatigue","modafinil"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"Modafinil","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Modafinil","interventionNames":["Drug: modafinil"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"modafinil","description":"Tablet, 400 mg once daily, morning (200 mg if age 65 or above) for 3 months","armGroupLabels":["Modafinil"],"otherNames":["modiodal, provigil"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"Tablets, 400 mg once daily ( 200 mg if age 65 or above)morning for 3 months.","armGroupLabels":["placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI- 20)","description":"Questionnaire","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MFI-20","description":"Questionnaire","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"MFI-20","description":"Questionnaire","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Fatigue severity scale (FSS)","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"FSS","description":"Questionnaire","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"FSS","description":"Questionnaire","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in bone mineral density and musclemass from baseline to 3 months","description":"DXA-scans.
