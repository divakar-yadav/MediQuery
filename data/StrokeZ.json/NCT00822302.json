Such plaques can cause strokes and there is great benefit from early surgical removal, however such surgical procedures involve significant risks to the patient.\n\nThe investigators propose infusing HDL into patients prior to removal of their unstable carotid plaque and measuring the changes in inflammatory responses in comparison to a similar placebo controlled group of patients.","detailedDescription":"Following written informed consent, patients will be randomised to either the placebo or active arm of the study. Bloods will be taken for baseline measurements, and the infusion of either saline (placebo) or rHDL (active agent) will be carried out on the ward. Infusion will take 4 hours, and the active agent infused at 40mg/kg.\n\nJust prior to CAE, bloods will be collected (24 hours post-infusion) and the atherosclerotic tissue collected into RNA stabilising agent for subsequent analysis. Further bloods will then be collected 24 hours post-operatively (48 hours post-infusion).\n\nPatients vital signs will be monitored hourly following infusion and will be reviewed in out-patients at 6 weeks after the operation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["atherosclerosis","stroke","ischaemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1.Saline Infusion","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomised to this arm will receive an infusion of saline","interventionNames":["Drug: Saline"]},{"label":"2.recHDL","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomised to the active comparator arm of the study will receive 40mg/kg reconstituted High density lipoproteins (lot nos 05422-00006) over a period of 4 hours, 24 hours prior to carotid endarterectomy.","interventionNames":["Drug: Reconstituted High Density Lipoprotein"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Reconstituted High Density Lipoprotein","description":"RecHDL (Lot Nos 05422-00006)is provided as a lyophilised powder and reconstituted with sterile water at 25 mg/ml.
