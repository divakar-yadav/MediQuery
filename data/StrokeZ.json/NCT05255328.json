The most common mutation is in the mtDNA gene MT-TL1 encoding the mitochondrial tRNALeu (UUR). For understanding the development of seizures in patients with mitochondrial disease, a study has recently emphasized the deficiency of astrocytic glutamine synthetase, creating a disinhibited neuronal network for seizure generation. The investigators propose to evaluate nine patients with mitochondrial DNA mutation and MELAS. Patients will receive oral supplementation with 12-18 g/day of glutamine (adjusted for weight and plasma concentrations). The primary outcome measures modification in clinical scales."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["MELAS Syndrome"],"keywords":["MELAS","Glutamine","Oral supplements","Amino acids"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Glutamine oral supplementation","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MELAS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with MELAS syndrome will receive 12-18g/day of glutamine","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Glutamine oral supplement"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Glutamine oral supplement","description":"12-18 g /day of glutamine supplementation","armGroupLabels":["MELAS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical efficacy;
