Consecutive patients with first-ever stroke without previously known dysphagia with persistent dysphagia (DOSS\\<6) at 3 months (12±3 weeks) post-stroke onset. Patients are eligible to participate if they are admitted to one of the following seven hospitals/centers in Sweden: Umeå University hospital, Danderyds hospital, Skaraborg hospital (Skövde), Helsingborg hospital, Halland hospital, Kungälv hospital and Ellenbogen in Malmö. Further centers will be recruited. Exclusion criteria: Unable/unwilling to give informed consent or to cooperate.\n\nRandomization will be made web-based 1:1 by use of the developed REDCap system with stratification for center and aspiration (yes/no).\n\nIn total, 336 stroke patients (168 intervention group; 168 control group) with persistent dysphagia 12(±3) weeks after stroke onset will be included in the present study. The intervention group will be offered to undergo oral neuromuscular training alongside routine care with compensatory training for 3 months. The control group will only be offered routine care with compensatory training for 3 months.\n\nThe participants' status regarding swallowing function, nutritional status, quality of life related to swallowing, pneumonia, functional status including lip force, and death will be assessed before and after the completed intervention period, and 6 months post-intervention.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be analyzed using an ordinal regression (proportional odds) model, adjusting for baseline DOSS as well as for the stratifying variables center and aspiration.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that swallowing intervention with oral neuromuscular training is more effective than routine care rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia","Stroke"],"keywords":["Dysphagia","Stroke","Intervention","Oral neuromuscular training","Randomized control
