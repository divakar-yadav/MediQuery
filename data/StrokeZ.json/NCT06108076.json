Plasma ketones are avidly extracted by cardiac muscle and their uptake is not dependent upon insulin or influenced by insulin resistance.","detailedDescription":"After the screening visit, subject will take two separate doses of oral ketones during visit two. Subjects will have their first dose (400mg/kg) upon completion of the baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and then a second dose (400mg/kg) approximately 1.5 hours after their consumption of the 1st dose. Approximately 1.5 hours after their second dose (3hr since first dose), the subject will undergo a second cardiac MRI. Baseline Blood samples of Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), acetoacetate (ACAC), Free Fatty Acids (FFA), insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, and an additional 10ml (for storage and later analysis) will be drawn prior to their first dose, then every 30 minutes after their first dose, until completion of the second MRI, then a final blood draw upon completion of the MRI for a total of 8 blood draws during visit 2. An IV catheter will be placed into one antecubital vein by a study nurse for all blood draws during visit 2.\n\nThe subject will then be asked to return to complete a third MRI approximately 24 hours after their second MRI. Blood samples for BOHB, acetoacetate (ACAC), insulin, c-peptide and glucagon, and an additional 10 ml will be drawn prior to their third MRI. An IV catheter will be placed into one antecubital vein by a study nurse for all blood draws during visit 3.\n\nAfter completion of the third MRI, subjects will be dosed KE 400mg/kg once daily until the visit 4 MRI can be completed.\n\nBlood samples for BOHB, acetoacetate (ACAC), insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, proBNP, and an additional 10 ml will be drawn prior to their fourth MRI. An IV catheter will be placed into one antecubital vein by a study nurse for all blood draws during visit 4.
