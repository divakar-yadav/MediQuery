There are many therapeutic approaches in Pakistan that are in use for the patients with dysarthria following stroke. One of them is one to one intervention which may include one dysarthria client along with the speech therapist. The therapist delivers step by step instructions to the client. The essential assessments are being held to initiate the treatment. The application of this intervention approach leaves some drawbacks, such as, the patients find it difficult to relate and adapt to the treatment offered. Generalization also seems to be complicated. The patients express a lack in motivation and support. The other mode of approach is group intervention, in which multiple dysarthria clients along with their caregivers \\& speech therapist are included. In the later one, there are greater chances of recovery for patients as they get peer support and build confidence through newfound friends, peer communication with realistic social setting, learning through teaching, increased awareness of skills and it is time constraints. The culture of practicing group sessions with dysarthria patients is lacked in Pakistan, which intends to meet and compensate for all the drawbacks and lacks of one on one intervention. By including the Dysarthria patients, therapist and the caregivers in the group intervention, there're greater chances of reduced anxiety for both patients \\& caregivers regarding disorder \\& its recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysarthria as Late Effect of Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Dysarthia","Intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"RCT with intervention having experimental group. random Allocation of participants.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Regular speech therapy","type":"OTHER","description":"Regular speech therapy will be provided to the controlled group.","interventionNames":["Other: Regular speech therapy"]},{"label":"Group intervention","type":"OTHER","description":"Group intervention will be provided to the experimental group.","interventionNames":["Other: Group intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Group intervention","description":"Group intervention programme designed for stroke survivors with dysarthria and their carers.
