The collected data will include demographic information, comorbidity characteristic, FRAIL scale, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, relevant blood tests, the results of imaging examination, prescription of drugs, length of hospital stay, number of overall rehospitalizations and death. With this database, the investigators intend to formulate an individualized treatment strategy for these patients.","detailedDescription":"According to the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey, a significant proportion of elderly individuals aged over 65 suffer from two or more chronic diseases, with prevalence rates ranging from 22.5% to 47.5%. However, due to the decentralized storage of health data, lack of standardization, and collaboration barriers, it is challenging to make use of this information in a meaningful way.Therefore, there is an urgent need to overcome the technical challenges and build an intelligent diagnosis and treatment system for this vulnerable population.\n\nTo achieve this goal, it is necessary to establish a clinical database and biobank that includes data on all elderly patients with multimorbidity. This will enable researchers to conduct clinical research on various factors, including clinical and biological predictors of adverse events such as emergency visits, strokes, heart failure, myocardial infarction, tumors, and acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, the database will facilitate the development of systematic and individualized evaluation tools for elderly patients with multimorbidity, identify prognostic factors that improve short- and long-term outcomes, and enable the participation in multi-center trials at the national or international level. Ultimately, this effort will help establish clinical database and biobank data collection standards for future studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Comorbidities and Coexisting Conditions","Old Age; Debility"],"keywords":["Cognition Disorders","Frailty","Coronary heart disease","Atrial fibrillation","Stroke","Heart failure","Hypertension","Valvular heart disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"young-aged patients","description":"Patients aged 18 to 45 years old."},{"label":"middle-aged patients","description":"Patients aged 46 to 64 years old."},{"label":"elderly patients","description":"Patients aged 65 and older."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of geriatric syndromes including falls, cognitive impairment, dizziness and frailty","description":"collection of clinical data in the medical record and follow-up update","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of survival rate","description":"collection of clinical data in the medical record and follow-up update","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* (1) written and informed consent, (2) participants aged 18 years or older.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* (1) Unwilling to participate in the study, (2) Unable or unwilling to cooperate with the baseline or follow-up data collection.","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"hospital based group","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Shao-ping Nie, MD,PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8613701186772","email":"spnie@ccmu.edu.cn"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beijing","zip":"100029","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Shao-Ping Nie, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86-10-84005256","email":"spnie@ccmu.edu.cn"},{"name":"Shao-Ping Nie, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000073496","term":"Frailty"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9111","name":"Heart Failure","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5991","name":"Cognition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9127","name":"Heart Valve Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M1175","name":"Frailty","asFound":"Debility","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
