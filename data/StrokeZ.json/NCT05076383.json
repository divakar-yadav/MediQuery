In this two-armed randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 66 sub-acute stroke patients who meet the trial criteria will be recruited. The patients will randomly receive task-specific training based on a motor relearning program (MRP) or a conventional physical therapy program (CPT). Twenty-four rehabilitation sessions will be conducted for eight weeks. Both interventions will be followed by analysis of patients' balance, gait and performance of activates of daily living at two time period; post-intervention and follow-up after 3-months, using clinical outcome measures and instrumental analysis of balance and gait."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Motor learning","Balance","Mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Motor relearning program (MRP)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Study Group (Motor relearning program)"]},{"label":"Conventional physical therapy program (CPT)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Control Group (Conventional physical therapy program)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Study Group (Motor relearning program)","description":"Task-specific training based on motor relearning program will be performed for 8 weeks (3 sessions per week; 1 hr. per session; total 24 sessions).
