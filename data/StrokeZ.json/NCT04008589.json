These include EEG-spectra and coherence measures, and visual evoked potentials. The design of stimulation protocols involves an appropriate sham-stimulation condition and sufficient follow-up periods to test whether the effects are stable. This is the first application of non-invasive current stimulation for vision rehabilitation in stroke-related visual field deficits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Electrical Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized, controlled","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rtACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"repetitive transorbital ACS","interventionNames":["Device: repetitive transorbital AC Stimulation","Device: combination of transcranial direct current stimulaton and rtACS"]},{"label":"tDCS/rtACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sequential tDCS -
