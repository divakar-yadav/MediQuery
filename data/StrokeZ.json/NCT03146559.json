EMG signals from the healthy hand - while performing wrist dorsi flexion movement - will be used to activate electric muscles stimulation of the dorsi flexors of the paretic hand.","detailedDescription":"14 post-stroke subjects will be recruited from neurological rehabilitation department at Loewenstein rehabilitation hospital, Ra'anana, Israel. The patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Experimental group. 2) Control group. The 3 weeks intervention (15 sessions) in each group will include electric muscles stimuli (pulse rate 35-100Hz pulse width 200 microseconds, 5 sec on and 10 sec rest ) of the hemiparetic hand for 15 minutes. The patients in the experimental group will wear a wireless Bluetooth EMG (\"Myo\" bracelet) on their healthy forearm and when they will execute wrist dorsi flexion, the data will be transmitted to a PC which will be used to activate (via Arduino controller) a Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulator (TENS) that is attached to the paretic dorsi flexors (electrodes are placed on the paretic forearm). The control group will get only automatic stimuli on the paretic forearm via the TENS.\n\nThe assessments will be done before the intervention, at the end of three weeks of intervention, and after 1 month from the end of the intervention (follow up).\n\nThe outcomes will include: active range of motion of fingers and wrist dorsi flexion (using cybermin 5DT glove for digital measures), upper limb section of Fugl-Meyer test, Box and Blocks test and Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. Only before the beginning of the intervention the sensory ability of the patient will be assessed using the Sensory section of Fugl-Meyer (FM) and Semmes-Weinstein filaments for superficial sensation. Normalized lesion data will be computed using the ABLE module within MEDx software (Medical Numerics).\n\nDifferences between groups will be calculated using t-tests or Mann-Whitney, depending on distribution of normality with corrections for multiple comparisons."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Cross education","EMG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EMG and TENS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Wireless Bluetooth EMG (\"Myo\") bracelet will be placed on the healthy forearm.
