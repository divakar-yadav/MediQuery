Total Twenty eight hemiplegic patients will be recruited according to inclusion criteria and data will be collected from Riphah rehabilitation centre Lahore and Mian Munshi Hospital Lahore (DHQ). The patients will randomly assigned to a mirror therapy group (n=14) and Fine motor activities group (n=14). The patients in both groups will undergo conventional therapy for 4 weeks (60minutes/day, 5 days/week). The patients will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the treatment by Fugl- Meyer Aassessment (FMA) wolf motor assessment scale and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). After approval from ethical committee, data collection will be started and informed consent will be taken from all patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Acute Pain","Weakness, Muscle"],"keywords":["Stroke, Ischemic","Acute Pain","Weakness, Muscle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Study participants will be divided in two groups.
