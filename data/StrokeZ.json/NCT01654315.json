This devastating impairment undermines performance of valued activities and quality of life. Although rehabilitation is commonly provided, conventional affected arm rehabilitative strategies have negative evidence, or no evidence, supporting their use. Thus, there remains a need for evidence-based rehabilitative strategies for arm hemiparesis.\n\nNewer rehabilitative approaches emphasize repetitive, task-specific practice (RTP) incorporating the affected arm. However, many of these promising regimens require participation in intensive therapies, and most are only efficacious on the least impaired patients. Thus, there remains a need for an efficacious, practical RTP technique to address moderate affected arm hemiparesis.\n\nTo address the above shortfalls, one of the investigators team members piloted an innovative brace integrating electromyography (EMG) and robotics. In his case series, 8 stroke patients exhibiting moderate arm impairment successfully participated in RTP, with the brace (called the \"Myomo\") detecting and augmenting their movement attempts. Aided by the Myomo, participation in the RTP regimen reduced subjects' affected arm impairment and spasticity. The next logical step is to test Myomo + RTP efficacy using randomized controlled methods and an appropriate sample size.","detailedDescription":"The primary objective of this small efficacy study is to collect randomized, controlled pilot data estimating clinical effectiveness of this combined, EMG/robotics approach in conjunction with RTP. A unique adjunct will be acquisition of biomechanical data as an outcome measure. Based on pilot data, the central hypothesis is that Myomo therapy with RTP will exhibit significant impairment reductions. We will test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objective by pursuing the following specific aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Compare efficacy of Myomo + RTP with RTP only and Myomo only on affected arm impairment. Thirty stroke patients exhibiting moderate affected arm deficits will be randomly assigned to receive: (a) Myomo combined with RTP (Myomo + RTP); (b) RTP only (RTP), which constitutes the most frequently used regimen in clinical environments;2,3 or (c) Myomo therapy only (Myomo). The current study design will determine the additive effect of Myomo training to RTP, while also discerning the relative efficacy of RTP only or Myomo use only. The intended duration of contact will be equivalent across groups.\n\nAffected arm impairment, the primary study outcome, will be measured by the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Impairment Scale (FM), the primary outcome measure. The FM will be administered by a blinded rater twice before intervention, immediately post-intervention (POST), and two months post-intervention (POST-2) with POST serving as the primary study endpoint. The primary study hypothesis is that subjects in the Myomo + RTP group will exhibit significantly larger FM score changes than Myomo or RTP subjects at POST. It is also hypothesized that these changes will be sustained at POST-2.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine the impact of Myomo + RTP on affected arm outcomes. The investigators will administer the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), to all subjects before intervention, at POST, and at POST-2. When compared to their scores before intervention, it is hypothesized that Myomo + RTP subjects will exhibit significantly larger AMAT score changes,than subjects in the other groups at POST. These differences will be sustained at POST-2."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["RTP Only Group","Myomo Only Group","Myomo + RTP Group"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: Myomo Only Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental: Myomo Only Group Patients are administered rehabilitative therapy known as \"repetitive task specific practice\" (RTP) using only the Myomo robotic device targeting their affected arms on 3 days/week, in 1/2 hour increments, during an 8-week period.","interventionNames":["Device: Myomo Robotic Arm"]},{"label":"Experimental: Myomo + RTP Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental: Myomo + RTP Group Patients are administered rehabilitative therapy using both the Myomo robotic device and RTP targeting their affected arms on 3 days/week in 1/2 hour increments, during an 8 week period.
