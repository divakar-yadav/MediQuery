Emergent evaluation, prompt acute treatment, and identification of stroke etiology for secondary prevention are key to decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with cerebrovascular disease. Key to treatment and prevention is the identification of stroke etiology - large vessel atherosclerosis, cardioembolic phenomenon, or in-situ small vessel cerebrovascular disease - since primary and secondary prevention measures differ based on stroke subtype. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke includes a combination of patient history, clinical assessment, and brain imaging. However, identifying the cause of cerebrovascular ischemia is challenging and routinely assigned of cryptogenic origin.\n\nTherefore, the need is great, to understand the pathogenesis of AIS events in order to develop more effective preventative measures. Recent studies have identified the differential expression of genes in whole blood which may differentiate the major ischemic stroke types. Such differences may help identify AIS events that are more likely to respond to therapy specifically tailored to the major stroke type. Furthermore, by establishing a more robust standard for secondary prevention, future stroke events may be avoided.\n\nBASIC is a multisite prospective study with a estimated enrollment of up to 500 consecutive adult subjects including no more than 50 age, gender and co-morbidity matched controls (\"Controls\"). Stroke subjects will be recruited from patients who present to the Emergency Department (ED) or hospital with suspected AIS. Research personnel will identify potential patients by responding to \"Brain Attack\" pages from the ED to the Stroke Team for patients who meet current Brain Attack criteria. Following evaluation by the ED and neurology physicians, the clinical coordinator will verify the patient had a suspected AIS and meets eligibility criteria. The patient or their legal surrogate will be approached for study participation. Written informed consent will be obtained for all subjects enrolled.\n\nControl subjects will be those who present to the Emergency Department for non-stroke reasons but have one or more risk factors for stroke. These subjects will not have a recruitment window. They can be consented as they present to the hospital. Tubes will be marked as controls. In past studies, these have been collected during slow times in the Emergency Department. Once the study has reached 50 controls, the sponsor will stop enrolling for this group. This has been done in the past by sending the sites a communication that the control group quota has been reached.\n\nThe recruitment window will be determined by time of symptom onset, time of presentation at ED or hospital, and ability to consent. This will include patients that present within 30 hours of symptom onset or last known normal time and clinical evidence suggesting Acute Ischemic Stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Ischemia","Atrial Fibrillation","Transient Ischemic Attack","Transient Cerebrovascular Events","Thrombotic Stroke","Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Complication","Stroke of Basilar Artery","Atherosclerosis","Atheroma","Cardioembolic Stroke","Cardiomyopathies","Cardiovascular Stroke","Thromboembolism"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Atrial fibrillation","Transient neurological event","Cryptogenic stroke","Gene expression","RNA","Anticoagulant","NOAC","Implantable cardiac monitor","Point of care","tPA","Thrombectomy","Cardiac monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Biospecimen will be whole blood samples."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Stroke","description":"Ischemic stroke subjects presenting within 30 hours from symptom onset will have al PAX Gene Blood RNA tubes drawn upon arrival to the Emergency Department (if available) or hospital.\n\nBiomarker blood draw","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: ISCDX blood test"]},{"label":"Control","description":"Control group subjects will have PAX Gene Blood RNA tubes drawn.
