Evaluating factors associated with statins use as well as high dose statins use are also objectives of the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Hypertension","Diabetes Mellitus","Dyslipidemias"],"keywords":["cardiovascular diseases","primary prevention","secondary prevention","statins"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2133900,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Secondary prevention","description":"Individuals with previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke","interventionNames":["Drug: Statin"]},{"label":"Primary prevention","description":"Individuals with hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipidemia","interventionNames":["Drug: Statin"]},{"label":"Unknown diagnosis","description":"Individuals without a previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke or a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipidemia","interventionNames":["Drug: Statin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Statin","description":"Statin use","armGroupLabels":["Primary prevention","Secondary prevention","Unknown diagnosis"],"otherNames":["simvastatin","calcium rosuvastatin","atorvastatin","pitavastatin","pravastatin","lovastatin","rosuvastatin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Statin use on secondary prevention","description":"Proportion of patients with previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Statin use on primary prevention","description":"Proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipidemia on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Statin use on patients with previous myocardial infarction","description":"Proportion of patients with previous myocardial infarction on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Statin use on patients with previous stroke","description":"Proportion of patients with previous stroke on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on secondary prevention","description":"Proportion of patients with previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke on high dose statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on patients with previous myocardial infarction","description":"Proportion of patients with previous myocardial infarction on high dose statin","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on patients with stroke","description":"Proportion of patients with previous stroke on high dose statin","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Statin use on patients with diabetes","description":"Proportion of patients with diabetes on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Statin use on patients with hypertension","description":"Proportion of patients with hypertension on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Statin use on patients with dyslipidemia","description":"Proportion of patients with dyslipidemia on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on patients with diabetes","description":"Proportion of patients with diabetes on high dose statin","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on patients with hypertension","description":"Proportion of patients with hypertension on high dose statin","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on patients with dyslipidemia","description":"Proportion of patients with dyslipidemia on high dose statin","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Statin use on patients with unknown diagnosis","description":"Proportion of patients without previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke or a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipidemia on statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"High dose statin use on patients with unknown diagnosis","description":"Proportion of patients without previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke or a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipidemia on high dose statin use","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All individuals aged 18 years or older registered on the epHealth database\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All individuals aged 18 years or older registered on the epHealth database will be used in this study.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"M.
