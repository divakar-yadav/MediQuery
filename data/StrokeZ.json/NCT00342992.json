Originally, this was a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial primary prevention trial testing the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence and mortality. The study was conducted in Finland as a collaboration between the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Public Health Institute of Finland. NCI has maintained passive surveillance of the cohort through Finnish national registries, including the cancer registry.\n\nThe primary purpose of the ATBC cohort follow-up is to use the existing risk factor data and biological specimens (i.e., serum, whole blood, DNA, red blood cells, and toenails) to test hypotheses relevant to cancer etiology, survival, early detection, and prevention. These data and biospecimens continue to provide an invaluable resource for the study of biochemical, nutritional, genetic, and molecular hypotheses. These analyses are made all the more informative and powerful by the addition of cases identified annually during the follow-up period, and the research benefits from a longer pre-diagnosis period (now over 30 years).","detailedDescription":"The ATBC study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial to determine whether daily supplementation with a-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers among male smokers. Between 1985 and 1988, 29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years, who smoked at least five cigarettes per day, were recruited from southwestern Finland. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a-tocopherol as dl-a-tocopheryl acetate (50 mg/day), beta-carotene as all-trans-beta-carotene (20 mg/day), both supplements, or placebo capsules for 5-8 years (median 6.1 years) through April 30, 1993. Post-intervention follow-up has continued through the Finnish Cancer Registry and other national registries, and epidemiological analyses continue to be conducted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Diabetes Mellitus","Heart Disease","Cancer"],"keywords":["Vitamin E","Micronutrients","Genetics","Smoking","Biomarkers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29133,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy Volunteers","description":"Male smokers in Southwestern Finland"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cancer","description":"Annual linkage with Finnish Cancer Registry","timeFrame":"Annually"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Causes of mortality","timeFrame":"Anually"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nCurrent smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at study entry) from Southwestern Finland.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Females\n* Proven malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or cancer in situ)\n* Severe angina pectoris\n* Chronic renal insufficiency\n* Cirrhosis of the liver\n* Chronic alcoholism\n* Anticoagulant therapy\n* Use of supplements containing vitamin E greater than 20 mg/day, or vitaming A greater than 20,000 IU/day, or beta-carotene greater than 6 mg/day","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"69 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Male smokers in Southwestern Finland","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Demetrius A Albanes, M.D.","affiliation":"National Cancer Institute (NCI)","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"National Institute of Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland","city":"Helsinki","country":"Finland","geoPoint":{"lat":60.16952,"lon":24.93545}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"8205268","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"The alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene lung cancer prevention study: design, methods, participant characteristics, and compliance.
