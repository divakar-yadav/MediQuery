Ambulation training, therefore, is an important part of physical therapy intervention for these patients. Conventional neurologic physical therapy for ambulation training, based sorely on neurophysiology, prohibits early ambulation experience after stroke in attempt to avoid the development of abnormal gait patterns. Such an approach has been shown to be limited in helping these patients regain independent ambulatory ability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Gait","Ambulation training","Neurologic physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Treadmill Training","description":"Partian body weight support treadmill training, 30 min/day \\* 3 days /week"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To investigate walking speed and stride length as the representation of ambulation ability","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To investigate the the co-activation duration between the activity of hamstring and quadriceps, and tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius joints, the level of symmetry in step length and stance/swing duration ratio between the affected and unaffected legs","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* between 40 and 75 years old\n* first stroke with R't side hemiplegia due to middle cerebral artery occlusion and received acute treatment at NTUH\n* being willing to sign an informed consent approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital\n* able to ambulate independently in parallel bars and having no independent ambulation ability outside parallel bars\n\nExcursion criteria:\n\n* having unstable vital sign, unconsciousness, or obvious cognitive, perception, and language impairment, and couldn't communicate with the experimenters\n* having other neurological diseases, or moderate to severe neuromuscular or musculoskeletal or cardiovascular disorders, or disorders from systematic diseases other than stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pei-Fang Tang, PhD","affiliation":"National Taiwan University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"School and Graduate Institute of Physical Therapy College of Medicine, National Taiwan University","city":"Taipei","state":"Province of China","zip":"100","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
