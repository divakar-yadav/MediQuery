Our project uses a scientifically rigorous efficacy study to evaluate a remotely delivered 8-week dyadic (couples-based) positive psychology intervention to reduce emotional distress in stroke survivors and their carepartners. If successful, couples may be better emotionally equipped to cope with the sequelae of stroke, and have better rehabilitation outcomes and quality of life.","detailedDescription":"The impact of stroke is shared between the stroke survivor and their spousal/partner caregiver (carepartner). An estimated 30-50% of stroke survivors and carepartners experience depressive or anxiety symptoms that negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes and quality of life. Yet, interventions to support couples post-stroke are largely insufficient or inaccessible. To address this need, we developed a novel remotely-delivered dyadic intervention to promote Resilience in Stroke survivor-carepartner Dyads (ReStoreD), in which couples learn and practice goal-setting, communication strategies, and positive psychology activities like expressing gratitude, finding meaning, and fostering connections. Preliminary pilot study results were promising, showing reduced depressive symptoms and increased resilience in participants. The purpose of the current study is to conduct a Stage II efficacy trial of the 8-week ReStoreD intervention with a sample of 200 dyads (n=400) consisting of one individual who has sustained an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke between 3 months and 3 years prior to enrollment and a cohabitating carepartner. Using a fully-powered, randomized waitlist-control design, we will determine efficacy of ReStoreD to reduce emotional distress in both dyad members (Aim 1). We will also examine effects of ReStoreD on secondary outcomes (resilience, relationship quality, stress-related stroke, meaningful activity engagement) as potential mediators (Aim 2), and explore moderators to determine whether certain subgroups respond better to the intervention (Aim 3). All participants will complete standardized, validated assessments at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 6-month follow up. All aspects of the study, including intervention activities and assessments, are conducted remotely, online.\n\nThis is the first rigorously designed efficacy trial to test a positive psychology intervention for stroke survivors and their carepartners. When the aims of this study are realized, we will 1) have a remotely-delivered, dyadic intervention to support couples post-stroke; 2) have a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the intervention's effect on emotional distress, and can use this information to inform future interventions; and 3) be able to identify a more specific target population for whom the intervention works best. Ultimately, if found efficacious, this intervention will offer sustainable and accessible support for couples who are coping with stroke to improve rehabilitation outcomes and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression, Anxiety","Coping Skills","Couples"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized waitlist control design","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ReStoreD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"8-week intervention that is remotely delivered, consisting of psychoeducation and positive psychology activities.
