The aim is not simply walking in controlled environment, but to achieve dynamic walking. Dynamic walking is the ability of an individual to adjust to the changing surfaces and terrains. thereby returning to achieve active participation in the community. Hence, recovery of walking ability is the primary goal when planning treatment for patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Backward walking, stroke, gait training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The treatment given by investigator unaware of allocation of patients and outcome variables measured by different investigator","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"forward walking on leveled surface","interventionNames":["Other: Backward walking on sand"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"forward walking on sand.","interventionNames":["Other: Backward walking on sand"]},{"label":"Group 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Backward walking on leveled surface","interventionNames":["Other: Backward walking on sand"]},{"label":"Group 4","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Backward walking on sand.","interventionNames":["Other: Backward walking on sand"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Backward walking on sand","description":"the patient will be walking backwards on sand with therapist standing close to support in case of fall.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1","Group 2","Group 3","Group 4"],"otherNames":["forward walking on sand"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Gait velocity (m/s)","description":"Measured by Stride Analyser","timeFrame":"10-15 mins"},{"measure":"Cadence (Number of steps per min)","description":"Measured by stride Analyser","timeFrame":"10-15 mins"},{"measure":"Stride length in meters","description":"Measured by stride Analyser","timeFrame":"10-15 mins"},{"measure":"Gait cycle in seconds","description":"Measured by stride Analyser","timeFrame":"10-15 mins"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"ADL","timeFrame":"45 Mins"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n* Had experienced stroke for the first time.\n* Unilateral involvement.\n* Demonstrate motor stage 3 or 4 on Brunnstrom motor recovery.\n* Able to walk 12 m with or without assistive devices.\n* Medically stable.\n* Able to follow simple commands.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patient exhibits comorbid disease other than stroke that may affect gait.\n* Any conditions contra indicated to exercises\n* Any other cardio-pulmonary or orthopedic disorders that affects walking ability of the participant.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"King Khalid Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Al Majma'ah","state":"Riyadh","zip":"11952","country":"Saudi Arabia","contacts":[{"name":"faizan Z kashoo, Masters","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00966538149226","email":"f.kashoo@mu.edu.sa"},{"name":"shaik A Rahim, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00966534504703","email":"s.abdulrahim@mu.edu.sa"},{"name":"Faizan Z Kashoo, Masters","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Mazen M Alqahtani, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Shaik A Rahim, PhD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Dana A Yahya, PhD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Abdulaziz Alkathiry, PhD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.91097,"lon":45.35665}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28265136","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Makino M, Takami A, Oda A.
