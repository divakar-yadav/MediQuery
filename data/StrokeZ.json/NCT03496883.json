The central hypothesis is that rFVIIa, administered within 120 minutes from stroke onset with an identified subgroup of patients most likely to benefit, will improve outcomes at 180 days as measured by the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) and decrease ongoing bleeding as compared to standard therapy.","detailedDescription":"The investigators will perform a global, Phase III, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of rFVIIa plus best standard therapy vs. placebo and best standard therapy alone. The investigators will include participants with a volume of ICH ≥ 2 and \\< 60 cc, no more than a small volume of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (IVH score ≤ 7), age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80, Glasgow Coma Scale of ≥ 8, and treated within 120 minutes from stroke onset. To minimize time-to-treatment, the study will use emergency research informed consent procedures (including exception from informed consent (EFIC) in the United States) and mobile stroke units (MSUs), with a goal of ½ of participants treated within 90 minutes, as accomplished in the NINDS t-PA trials. The FASTEST Trial will include approximately 100 hospital sites and at least 15 MSUs in the NINDS-funded StrokeNet and key global institutions with large volumes of ICH patients and the ability to treat them within 120 minutes of stroke onset. Recruitment of 860 participants over 3½ years is planned. Countries participating in the trial include the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\n\nParticipants will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to rFVIIa 80 µg/kg dose (maximum 10 mg dose) or placebo. Participants in both arms will receive best standard therapy as per published AHA Guidelines for ICH, including a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome (ordinal mRS with the following categories: 0-2, 3, and 4-6) will be determined at 180 days, but participants will be followed by remote assessment at 30 days and 90 days. To measure growth of ICH, all participants will have a standard of care baseline non-contrast CT of the head and a repeat scan at 24 hours. Centralized volumetric measurements of ICH, IVH, and edema will be performed for both time points.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S will manufacture and supply rFVIIa as a research medication for use in the FASTEST Trial. Novo Nordisk A/S will also manufacture and supply matching placebo that is identical to rFVIIa in appearance and administration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Blinded study medication","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":860,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Recombinant Activated Factor VII (rFVIIa)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"rFVIIa given as IV injection over 2 minutes within 120 minutes of stroke onset","interventionNames":["Biological: Recombinant Activated Factor VII (rFVIIa)"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Matching placebo given as IV injection over 2 minutes within 120 minutes of stroke onset","interventionNames":["Biological: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Recombinant Activated Factor VII (rFVIIa)","description":"Participants will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to rFVIIa 80 µg/kg dose (maximum 10 mg dose) or matching placebo.
