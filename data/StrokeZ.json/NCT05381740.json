Participants will be randomized to receive a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or rTMS or sham rTMS. Real or sham rTMS will be delivered over an area in the brain called the higher motor cortices within the stroke-unaffected hemisphere, cHMC for short. This area (cHMC) is important for using both arms and hands together, or bimanual motor function. Real or sham cHMC rTMS will be given prior to upper limb therapy twice a week for 6 weeks in the lab. The investigators will measure bimanual motor function and control twice at the beginning, once after the 6-week treatment and once at 1-month after treatment. The investigators will also test possible mechanisms related to the treatment using brain functional MRI and TMS twice at the beginning and once after 6-week treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","brain stimulation","TMS","Upper Limb","rehabilitation","MRI","CVA","neuromodulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"In a prospective randomized controlled trial, an anticipated 18 stroke survivors with chronic (≥6 months) upper limb impairment will receive real or sham stimulation to the non-stroke hemisphere (cHMC).
