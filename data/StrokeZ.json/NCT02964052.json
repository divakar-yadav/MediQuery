Mechanisms of futile recanalization may include 1) large ischemic core, 2) poor collateral, and 3) presence of comorbidity. In this regards, developing selection criteria using acute stroke imaging and comorbidity is warranted.\n\nInvestigators will recruit the consecutive acute stroke patients who received IV thrombolysis and/or IA recanalization treatment. This study will perform with prospective design to develop CT-based clot, core and collateral scores and a comorbidity index for selecting stroke patients who are at high risks by the treatment. Investigators will firstly establish the CT-based scores and comorbidity index using a pre-existing cohort database. Using these CT-based and comorbidity index, Investigators will validate them in a multi-center prospectively cohort. In addition, Investigators will assess the cost-effectiveness of selecting patients based on the comorbidity index."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1359,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute ischemic stroke patients","description":"Acute ischemic stroke patients who received intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and/or intra-arterial (IA) recanalization treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Brain CT imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Brain CT imaging","description":"Investigators will analyzed the CT image that was performed in patients with hyperacute stroke.
