In addition, TMT has been shown to be a useful parameter for estimating skeletal muscle mass. Measurement of temporal muscle mass with CT and MRI has been studied in the literature in recent years. All stroke patients undergo cranial CT or MRI examinations at the time of admission. However, the literature indicates that USG can also be used to measure temporal muscle thickness. The recommended measurement points for CT, MRI, or USG in the studies performed to date depend on the particular imaging modality, and it does not seem possible to use them interchangeably. The aim of this study is to propose a new TMT measurement point that can be localized in a similar way in CT /MRI and USG, and to evaluate the reliability and agreement of these measurements."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcopenia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with cranial MRI","description":"Axial sections of 5 mm and 1 mm thickness will be imaged.
