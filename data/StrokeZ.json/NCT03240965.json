Younger (\\<60 years) and older (\\>60 years) volunteers will serve as control.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the second leading cause of death. At least 50% of stroke patients develop dysphagia, leading to aspiration pneumonia, which is the main cause of death in stroke \\[2\\].\n\nIt is assumed that normal sensitivity is vital for aspiration-free swallowing and for the triggering of the swallowing reflex.\n\nAli et al. demonstrated aspiration-free swallowing in healthy volunteers who underwent local anaesthesia of oral and pharyngeal structures \\[1\\]. Power et al. showed a reduced sensitivity of pharyngeal structures in stroke patients prone to aspiration \\[3\\].\n\nBy combining measuring sensitivity and flexible endoscopic swallowing studies, this study further investigates the role of sensitivity in swallowing Neuropsychological deficits of swallowing, such as swallowing apraxia or buccal hemineglect, is assessed by neuropsychological testing.\n\nAdditionally, there is no systematic research investigating the change in smell and taste in correlation with changes in stroke patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dysphagia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Volunteers <60 years","description":"Volunteers, who are able to consent to participation in the study, as control.","interventionNames":["Other: Sensitivity threshold","Diagnostic Test: Taste-/smell-test"]},{"label":"Volunteers >60 years","description":"Volunteers, who are able to consent to participation in the study, as control.","interventionNames":["Other: Sensitivity threshold","Diagnostic Test: Taste-/smell-test"]},{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients with supratentorial stroke, who are able to consent to participation in the study.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: FEES (flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing)","Other: Sensitivity threshold","Diagnostic Test: Taste-/smell-test","Diagnostic Test: Neuropsychological testing"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"FEES (flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing)","description":"Endoscopical swallowing study in stroke patients only","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sensitivity threshold","description":"Determining sensitivity threshold using a pudendal electrode","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients","Volunteers <60 years","Volunteers >60 years"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Taste-/smell-test","description":"Taste-/smell-test","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients","Volunteers <60 years","Volunteers >60 years"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Neuropsychological testing","description":"Neuropsychological testing for neglect, agnosia","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dysphagia","description":"Changes found in endoscopic swallowing study :\n\nPresence and severity of dysphagia (measured with Rosenbek's Penetration/Aspiration-scale)","timeFrame":"96 hours after initial symptoms"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neuropsychological deficits","description":"Agnosia, neglect","timeFrame":"96 hours after initial symptoms"},{"measure":"Lesion site","description":"Side, vascular territory, swallowing relevant structures","timeFrame":"96 hours after initial symptoms"},{"measure":"Sensitivity","description":"Sensitivity of faucial pillar region","timeFrame":"96 hours after initial symptoms"},{"measure":"Taste/Smell","description":"Smell-/Taste-score","timeFrame":"96 hours after initial symptoms"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nVolunteers:\n\n* informed consent\n\nStroke patients:\n\n* informed consent\n* new supratentorial stroke (\\<72 hours old) confirmed by CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pre-existing stroke oder dysphagia\n* extensive white matter lesions in CT- or MRI-scan\n* allergies to odorous substances or flavoring\n* contraindications for FEES (flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing), CT or MRI (stroke patients only)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients are recruited in a university hospital's department of neurology.\n\nVolunteers \\>60years are recruited in a trauma surgery ward at the same university hospital.\n\nVolunteers \\<60 are recruited without specified characteristics (aside from in-/exclusion criteria).","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Tobias Braun, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+49(0)-641-985","phoneExt":"56827","email":"tobias.braun@neuro.med.uni-giessen.de"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Tobias Braun, M.D.","affiliation":"University Giessen","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Gießen","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Gießen","state":"Hessen","zip":"35392","country":"Germany","contacts":[{"name":"Tobias Braun, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+49 641 985","phoneExt":"56827","email":"tobias.braun@neuro.med.uni-giessen.de"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":50.58727,"lon":8.67554}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"7943330","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Ali GN, Laundl TM, Wallace KL, Shaw DW, Decarle DJ, Cook IJ.
