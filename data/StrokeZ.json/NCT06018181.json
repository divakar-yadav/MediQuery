Since intravenous thrombolysis(IVT) can effectively improve the long-term functional prognosis of acute ischemic stroke(AIS), IVT within 4.5 hours of onset has been widely recommended by international guidelines.\n\nAlthough 35-53% of AIS patients achieve functional independence after receiving IVT, there are still a large number of patients who are disabled or even dead, and nearly 70% of patients have ineffective recanalization. Therefore, there is an urgent need for therapeutic drugs after IVT to further improve the prognosis and reduce the burden of AIS.\n\nShuxuetong injection is widely used in China in patients with AIS after IVT, but the situation in real clinical practice is unclear. Therefore, the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Shuxuetong Injection in patients with AIS treated with intravenous alteplase and tenecteplase, and obtain high-quality clinical evidence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Shuxuetong Injection","Intravenous Thrombolysis","Patient Registry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2008,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exposure group","description":"The exposure group was defined as patients receiving Shuxuetong injection and guideline-standardized treatment after intravenous alteplase or tenecteplase.\n\nMainly based on the following guidelines:(1)Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China 2018; (2)Guidelines for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack in China 2022.","interventionNames":["Drug: Shuxuetong Injection"]},{"label":"Non-exposure group","description":"The non-exposed group was defined as patients receiving guideline-standardized treatment after intravenous alteplase or tenecteplase."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Shuxuetong Injection","description":"According to clinical real treatment records","armGroupLabels":["Exposure group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-1)","description":"The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ranges from 0 (best score) to 6 (worst score).","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-2)","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-1) or returning to baseline","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"Distribution of mRS","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"Change of NIHSS","description":"The change in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores from baseline to 14 days or the day of discharge.
