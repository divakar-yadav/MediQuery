The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* the efficacy of motor imagery based on action observation treatment in the rehabilitation of patients with dysphagia in Wallenberg syndrome.\n* apply functional near infrared spectroscopy to explore the mechanism of action of this therapy.\n\nBoth groups received conventional dysphagia treatment, and the experimental group underwent the addition of motor imagery based on action observation treatment to the control group once a day for 14 days. Overall swallowing function was assessed before treatment and after 14 days of intervention. Meanwhile, the functional near infrared spectroscopy was used to detect changes in cerebral hemodynamics during the execution of volitional swallowing task and swallowing motor imagery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lateral Medullary Syndrome","Deglutition Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"conventional dysphagia treatment and motor imagery based on action observation treatment","interventionNames":["Other: conventional dysphagia treatment","Other: motor imagery based on action observation treatment"]},{"label":"The control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"conventional dysphagia treatment","interventionNames":["Other: conventional dysphagia treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional dysphagia treatment","description":"Conventional dysphagia treatment included oropharyngeal muscle movement training, orofacial alternating hot and cold stimulation, Masako swallowing training, Mendelsohn maneuver, therapeutic ingestion training, intermittent oral-esophageal tube feeding, and low-frequency electrical stimulation of swallowing neuromusculature, etc., 30 min each time, once a day for 14 consecutive days.","armGroupLabels":["The control group","The experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"motor imagery based on action observation treatment","description":"First, the therapist explained the purpose and principle of the intervention method to the patient, keeping the surrounding environment quiet and comfortable to avoid the patient's mood fluctuations due to external interference.

The content includes lip and tongue muscle relaxation exercises, healthy people eating, chewing, swallowing, drinking and other images.
