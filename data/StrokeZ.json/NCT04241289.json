This pilot study assessed the feasibility of a larger prospective international cohort study exploring this objective.","detailedDescription":"Delirium and cognitive decline are common following cardiac surgery and increase the burden on patients and health care resources. Covert (sub-clinical) strokes are associated with these complications. The investigators conducted a prospective cohort pilot study enrolling consecutive cardiac surgery patients to receive a post-operative brain MRI and a series of questionnaires to assess for changes in cognition, physical function and delirium. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was recorded during surgery with the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors placed on the patients' forehead. The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger study to establish an association between covert stroke and long-term cognitive decline in cardiac surgery patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Silent Stroke","Cognitive Decline"],"keywords":["covert stroke","cognitive decline","delirium","clinical stroke","CABG surgery","near infrared spectroscopy","cerebral oxygenation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recruitment rate","description":"Average recruitment rate per week","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"MRI completion","description":"Total number of patients completing the brain MRI study","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Lost to follow-up","description":"Proportion of patients lost to follow-up at the end of the study","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Covert stroke","description":"The proportion of patients experiencing covert stroke within 30 days of surgery","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Clinical stroke","description":"The proportion of patients experiencing clinical stroke 30 days after surgery","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Cognitive decline (MoCA)","description":"The proportion of patients experiencing cognitive decline 30 days after surgery using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Cognitive decline (DSST)","description":"The proportion of patients experiencing cognitive decline 30 days after surgery using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST).","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Physical function","description":"The proportion of patients experiencing cognitive decline 30 days after surgery using the Standard Assessment of Global-activities in the Elderly (SAGE).","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Delirium","description":"The proportion of patients experiencing delirium between postoperative day 2 and discharge or 30 days, whichever comes first using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).","timeFrame":"day 2 to 30 day, whichever comes first"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
