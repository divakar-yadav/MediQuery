The greatest current limitation in the management of this type of lesion is the use of antithrombotic medication (double antiaggregation) in the acute phase that is required in case of placing extracranial stent to stabilize the atheroma plaque. In relation to this antiplatelet regimen, the latest clinical practice guidelines warn about the risk of combining intravenous fibrinolysis with antiplatelet medication in the acute phase, since it seems to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However, the non-stabilization of the carotid atheroma plaque is associated with higher rates of cervical reocclusion, poorer functional prognosis, and higher mortality.\n\nTherefore, the use of a single antiplatelet agent could be a reasonable alternative. To establish the best protocol for mono-antiaggregant therapy in the acute phase of TL, the investigators propose to carry out a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial.\n\n1. All patients with ischemic stroke secondary to TL in the anterior circulation candidates for mechanical thrombectomy in whom cervical endoprosthesis will be placed in the acute phase, will be included, randomized to two groups: 500 mg of intravenous (iv) Aspirin vs Low dose regimen of Tirofiban iv.\n2. Carotid reocclusion rates and sICH rates will be evaluated within the first 24 hours after mechanical thrombectomy . As a secondary objective, the functional prognosis at 3 months in both groups will be analyzed, as well as a panel of biomarkers predictors of reocclusion in both groups. Establishing an antiplatelet management protocol in the acute phase in these patients would be an innovative strategy not developed by any other group worldwide, and would place us at the forefront of research in the field. Likewise, developing a clinical-biological predictive model of carotid reocclusion will allow us to establish risk patients in which to plan alternative treatments. Reference hospitals in the treatment of ischemic stroke at the national level with sufficient experience in the management of this pathology will participate in the project."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","Tandem Lesion","Tirofiban","Stent","Mechanical thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":240,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tirofiban","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An intravenous bolus of 500 micrograms of Tirofiban will be intravenously administered in five minutes with an infusion pump (infusion rate: 120 milliliters / hour), which is equivalent to 10 ml (500 micrograms) of Tirofiban.
