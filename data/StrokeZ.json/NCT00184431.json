Early and intensive physiotherapy seems to be beneficial for functional outcome after stroke although it is still unknown whether one specific physiotherapy technique is better than another.\n\nComparison: Traditional follow up care by the community health care system with additional task specific physiotherapy three times a week and a daily self administrated home training program compared to traditional follow up care by the community health care system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Physical Therapy Techniques","Musculoskeletal Equilibrium","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intensive task specific balance training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Physical therapy technique and exercises"]},{"label":"B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Traditional physical therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Physical therapy technique and exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Physical therapy technique and exercises","description":"The experimental group receives task specific physical therapy three times a week for the first four weeks after discharge from hospital and one session pr week for the next eight weeks in addition to ordinary physical therapy The active comparator group receives only ordinary physical therapy during this period.","armGroupLabels":["A","B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Berg Balance Scale","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up and six months follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mini Mental State Examination","timeFrame":"Inclusion"},{"measure":"Scandinavian Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"Inclusion"},{"measure":"Motor Assessment Scale","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Step Test","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Walking speed","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Barthel Index","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Fall Efficacy Scale","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","timeFrame":"Inclusion, four weeks follow-up, twelve weeks follow-up, six months follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Admitted to the stroke unit with a diagnosis of stroke\n* Living in the city of Trondheim\n* Included 4 - 14 days after first sign of symptoms\n* Modified Rankin Scale \\> 3 before admission to hospital\n* Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) less than 58 points and more than 14 points\n* SSS leg item less than 6 points or SSS movement item less than 12 points\n* Discharged to home or a rehabilitation clinic\n* Mini Mental State Examination Score more than 20 points\n* Able and willing to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Seriously heart- and lung-diseases\n* Other diseases which makes it difficult to evaluate the function\n* Already included in the trial","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bent Indredavik, assoc-prof","affiliation":"Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian university of Science and Technology","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology","city":"Trondheim","zip":"7004","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":63.43049,"lon":10.39506}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20558830","type":"RESULT","citation":"Askim T, Morkved S, Engen A, Roos K, Aas T, Indredavik B.
