FEES allows for a valid assessment of swallowing and description of dysphagia symptoms via standardized scores as the Secretion Severity Sating Scale (SSRS), the Penetration-Aspirations-Scale (PAS), the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Scale (YSPRSS) and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS-G).\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is conducted within the first few days after stroke as a routine examination to detect whether a cardiac disorder was the cause of stroke. The implementation of a TEE during cardiac surgery has a significant correlation with occurrences of postoperative dysphagia in patients after cardiac surgery \\[1\\].\n\nTEDRAS-Trial (Transesophageal Echocardiography: Dysphagia Risk in the Acute Phase After Stroke; ClinTrial.gov identifier NCT04302883) \\[2\\] was the first randomized and controlled trial to address the question of the extent to which TEE increases dysphagia risk in acute stroke patients. The results of the study confirmed the hypothesis that dysphagia severity worsens after TEE in the intervention group \\[2\\].\n\nThe aim of the prospective observational TEDRAS - Follow-up Trial is to investigate the limitations of the initial TEDRAS - Trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\nIn particular, the following parameters will be examined:\n\n1. The influence of the type and route (intravenous vs. oral) of anesthesia administered during TEE on swallowing in all cohorts studied.\n2. The correlation between the duration of TEE and the degree of deterioration in FOIS-G after TEE.\n3. The interrater reliability for the FEES.\n4.
