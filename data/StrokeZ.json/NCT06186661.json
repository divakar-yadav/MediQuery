Patients in each group were treated with neurophysiological exercises 3 times a week for 8 weeks and the subjects in Group 1 received cognitive rehabilitation additionally. The cognitive rehabilitation program consisted of individualized combined approaches including multicontextual treatment and bottom-up approaches. Loeweinstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to assess cognitive status, Short Form-36 (SF-36) to assess the quality of life, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to evaluate functional independence, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique- Short Form (CHART-SF) to evaluate social participation were used.","detailedDescription":"Forty-two patients who were diagnosed with a stroke by a neurologist were admitted to the Stroke Unit of Sisli Memorial Hospital from November 2011 to April 2014. Our study was conducted on 20 patients who met the inclusion criteria of the study. Informed consent was obtained from each patient before the study. The Ethics Commission of Hacettepe University Senate (application No: 410.01-3346) approved this study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 10 people using a random number table. The number of cases was determined to be 10 patients for each group by using the power analysis method. Power analysis was performed based on the LOTCA and MoCA scales which are expected to have the most changes after the therapy. In this small randomized controlled trial (Small RCT); while the first group (CRG) applied a neurophysiological and cognitive rehabilitation therapy consisting of individualized combined approaches including multi-contextual treatment and bottom-up approaches, the second group (CG) implemented only a neurophysiological treatment program as the control group.\n\nThe 1st group determined by randomization applied a total of 2 hours-exercise programs consisting of 1-hour-neurophysiological exercise and 1-hour cognitive rehabilitation. The 2nd Group implemented only a 1-hour neuropsychological exercise program. The treatment programs determined for both groups were carried out 3 days a week for a total of 8 weeks. Cognitive rehabilitation sessions of the 1st group included 30 minutes of remedial and functional adaptive approaches and 30 minutes of implementation of Multicontextual treatment intervention.\n\nWhile determining the cognitive rehabilitation programs of the patients; the weak areas in their cognitive skills were identified by analyzing the tests conducted before the treatment. Restorative approaches consisted of the repetition of pencil-and-paper activities and computer-based exercises according to the weak cognitive skills of the patients determined by the assessments made.\n\nWhile determining a specific multi-contextual treatment intervention for the patients; their roles, personalities, habits, interests, requests, living conditions, and environments were questioned, the activities determined by COPM were revised and the essential requirements of this approach tried to be ensured.\n\nAccording to this approach, using multiple environments and conditions, transfer of learning, and increasing the patient's awareness were provided. Also, the usage of various strategies and associating the new knowledge with the old knowledge were emphasized"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Quality of Life"],"keywords":["social participation","occupational therapy","stroke","cognition","quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Experimental group was applied a total of 2 hours-exercise programs consisting of 1-hour-neurophysiological exercise and 1-hour cognitive rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: neurophysiological exercise","Other: cognitive rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The Control Group was implemented only 1-hour neuropsychological exercise program.","interventionNames":["Other: neurophysiological exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"neurophysiological exercise","description":"The content of the treatment program consisted of neurophysiological exercises based on Bobath.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group","Experimental Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"cognitive rehabilitation","description":"Cognitive rehabilitation sessions of the experimental group included 30 minutes of remedial and functional adaptive approaches and 30 minutes of implementation of Multicontextual treatment intervention.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change outcome measure: Montreal Cognitive Assessment","description":"It has been developed to assess mild cognitive impairments, assesses several cognitive domains; executive functions, visuo-constructional skills, memory, language, attention and concentration, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation","timeFrame":"pre-treatment and 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Change outcome measure: Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment","description":"It has been developed to assess the basic cognitive skills in individuals with a brain damage that is caused by traumatic head injuries, stroke, and brain tumors.The LOTCA scale, the validity of which has been proved by the conducted studies so far, consists of a total of 26 subtests within 6 main areas: orientation, visual perception, spatial perception, motor praxis, visuomotor organization, and thinking operations.
