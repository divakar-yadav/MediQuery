The other groups will receive additional intervention consisting of aiming movement practice according two different protocols: discrete movements to targets placed in different directions and distances; and rhythmic movements also to targets placed in different directions and distances. Both additional interventional interventions will be conducted for 30 minutes over a 5 week-period (total: 10 sessions).\n\nClinical outcomes (motor control), functional and kinematic will be collected at baseline and at five weeks. Functional results will be collected at the beginning, after 5 weeks and 3 months after randomization. Data will be collected by a blinded assessor on patients' allocation group. All statistical analyzes will be carried out following the principles of intention to treat analysis and differences between groups will be performed using linear mixed models."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["exercise","rhythmic movement","discrete movement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Physical Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual therapy: joint mobility exercises, stimulating joint movement of the main active components of the upper limb; major muscle groups stretching, especially in the affected muscles by tone impairment; manual resistance training according to the degree of the patient's muscle strength, prioritizing the functional specificity of the upper limb, so the majority of the exercises will be held in open chain; motor coordination exercises, unilateral and bilateral motor tasks as well as task-oriented training of the upper limb with a focus on functional tasks.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Physical Therapy"]},{"label":"discrete movement training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Aiming movements training with the affected upper limb (unilateral training) or both limbs (bilateral training) on the surface of a table.

The movement time is the time interval between the beginning and the end of the movement. Reaction time is defined as the time between the start of the imperative stimulus to the beginning of the movement. The smoothness is evaluated by computing the number of times the acceleration zero crossing (positive to negative and vice versa). The resultant variable error (in centimeters) is a measure of variability for both the medial-lateral direction as anteroposterior, assessing the accuracy to hit the target.","timeFrame":"Five weeks after randomization"},{"measure":"Grip strength","description":"Body function and structure: it will measure the strength of grip and pinch through dynamometer.
