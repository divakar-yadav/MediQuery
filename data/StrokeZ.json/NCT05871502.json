Furthermore, when perfusion is reinstated, hyperglycemia causes secondary tissue damage through an increase in ischemic reperfusion damage. Thus, those patients with glycemia values \\< 155 mg/dL during mechanical thrombectomy, and especially at the time of reperfusion, will have greater ischemia-reperfusion damage, showing a different profile in miRNA expression, with better neurological and functional outcomes and higher risk of hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to evaluate the association between glycemia values at the time of reperfusion and stroke recovery at 3 months in patients with acute cerebral infarction treated with mechanical thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Before the start of the endovascular procedure, a subcutaneous blood glucose monitoring device will be implanted, which will be removed on day 15 (or at hospital discharge if this takes place before 15 days).
