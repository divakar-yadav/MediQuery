The ultimate goal is to create a fully implantable medical device that will restore movement in all parts of the body affected by a stroke. Independent movement will have functional benefits (e.g., being able to lift a fork to eat) and health benefits (e.g., decreasing the frequency of skin infections and preventing the formation of painful joint contractures)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Complication","Stroke","Stroke Sequelae","Hemiparesis","Arm Paralysis"],"keywords":["neuroprosthetic","neuroprosthesis","brain-computer","brain-machine","microelectrode","Utah array","orthosis","brain computer interface","assistive device","Neurorehabilitation","neurotechnology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participant will be implanted with the Blackrock Microsystems MultiPort system.","interventionNames":["Device: Cortimo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Cortimo","description":"The Cortimo comprises an implanted brain activity sensor and a wearable powered arm orthosis.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"],"otherNames":["MyoPro powered orthotic brace","Blackrock Microsystems MultiPort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from Baseline Fugl-Meyer Motor Impairment Score at 4 months","description":"The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) is a stroke specific index for estimating the performance of motor function.

The ARAT consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch and gross movements. Each sub scale has items ordered according to ascending difficulty: 0- can not perform any part of the test, 1- performs the test partially, 2- completes the test, but takes abnormally long time, 3- performs the test normally. The sum of all subscales are added to compute the total score. The total score ranges between 0 to 57. The higher score is considered to be better outcome.\n\nFrom: Yozbatiran et al.
