However, the evidences of EVT for patients with large infarct volume were limited. In this study, the investigators assume that best medical management plus EVT might be superior than best medical management alone for patients who have evidence of a large infarct volume. The primary objective of the study was to establish the safety and efficacy of EVT in patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from LVO in the anterior circulation and having a large infarct volume.","detailedDescription":"The ANGEL-ASPECT is a multicentered, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE) study. A total of approximately 488 patients (age from 18 to 80 years) within 24 hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who has the imaging evidence of an occlusion of the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) terminus and/or Middle Cerebral Artery Main Stem (MCA M1) segment, large infarct core \\[ defined as: 1) NCCT (noncontrast computed tomography) ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) 3-5, decided on last head CT scan before randomization. 2) Ischemic core volume ranges from 70-100ml, determined either on a diffusion-weighted MRI map based on an ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) threshold of less than 620 ×10-6mm2/s or on CTP (computed tomography perfusion) image with rCBF\\<30%\\] will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content. One group will receive best medical management alone the other group will receive best medical management plus EVT including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty or stenting. The primary objective is to establish the efficacy of EVT in patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from LVO in the anterior circulation and having a large infarct volume. The study consists of six visits including the day of randomization, 2 days after randomization, 7 days or discharge, and 30, 90 days and 1 year. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the program. The primary endpoint is the modified Rankin's scale (mRS) at 90 days. The trial is anticipated to last from September 2020 to October 2022 with 488 subjects recruited form about 50 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee (EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["endovascular therapy","large infarct volume"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":456,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EVT group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this group will receive best medical management plus EVT including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty or stenting.","interventionNames":["Drug: Best medical management","Procedure: Endovascular therapy"]},{"label":"Best medical management group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this group will receive best medical management alone.","interventionNames":["Drug: Best medical management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Best medical management","description":"All the patients enrolled received standard guideline-directed medical therapy including: monitor vital signs, management of blood pressure, glucose and lipids, antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy determined by treating physician) therapy if appropriate.","armGroupLabels":["Best medical management group","EVT group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular therapy","description":"In the procedure, the methods including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty and stenting can be used according to the local interventionalists' choice.
