Dystonia can hinder the functional activities making patient dependent on others for performance of daily living activities. Dystonia not only limits the physical activity of the patient but also affects their quality of life significantly. Various treatment protocols have been used in the literature for treatment of focal hand dystonia in the past including deep brain stimulation, kinesio taping, sensory oriented training, splinting, extracorporeal shock wave therapy and botox. Out of these Botox has gained much importance but it results only in improving the passive range of motion and has no consensus in improving the active range of motion and functional independence of the patient. The current study was planned to determine the effects of botulinum toxin type A combined with task-specific therapy, for post-stroke focal dystonia of upper limb."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Focal Hand Dystonia"],"keywords":["Dystonia Task-specific training Botulinum toxin type A"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A total of 46 patients were recruited in the study using non-probability purposive sampling and were divided randomly into two equal groups; control and experimental group, by sealed envelope method.
