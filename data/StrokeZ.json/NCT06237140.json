In the study, flexion-lateral flexion and rotation patterns will be studied together with antagonist patterns. In the antagonist movement involving cervical extension, the hand above the head is displaced diagonally and positioned to resist extension, lateral flexion and rotation. Before the exercise, the patient will be informed about the diagonal direction of the movement and made to feel it, and then the exercises will be performed in 5 sets, each set containing 10 repetitions. Participants will be given sufficient time to rest between sets.","interventionNames":["Other: PNF+ biofeedback exercise group"]},{"label":"biofeedback exercise group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"cervical stabilization exercises will be used to stimulate cervical proprioceptors. Neck stabilization training will be applied with a low load to strengthen the longus capitis and longus colli, the deep muscles of the upper cervical vertebra. The oblique and costal muscles, which are the auxiliary respiratory muscles, will be relaxed and the neck will be flexed. A pressure biofeedback device will be placed on the upper cervical spine (below the occiput) while lying with the air pocket set at 20 mmHg to obtain visual feedback from the dial. The pressure will be gradually increased to 30 mmHg in 2 mmHg increments. While the patient was asked to retract his chin, the contraction duration was determined as 10 seconds. While the contractions are repeated 10 times, a 3-5 second rest period will be given between each contraction.","interventionNames":["Other: PNF+ biofeedback exercise group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"PNF+ biofeedback exercise group","description":"Neurorehabilitation will be applied to this group, 5 sessions a week for 4 weeks, to increase balance and walking skills and reduce the risk of falling.","armGroupLabels":["PNF exercise group","biofeedback exercise group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mini Mental Test","description":"It will be used to evaluate the cognitive status of patients. It is a simple, short and valid test that is widely used in stroke patients. With this test, various cognitive functions of people such as orientation, recording memory, attention and calculation, recall and language are evaluated. The maximum score that can be obtained from the test is 30. Getting a score of 24 or above indicates that the patient's cognitive functions are within normal limits.","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"cervical joint position error test","description":"In this test, the laser pointer on the helmet and the circle shown at 1 cm intervals are used as a target board. Patients are seated in a chair with back support, 90 cm away from the target board fixed to the wall. Patients are first asked to memorize the position of their head without leaning in any direction and try to find the same point after an active head movement. Active head movements include flexion, extension, and right and left rotations. The desired movements are repeated 10 times. After the movement, the horizontal, vertical and global distances of each point returned to the starting point will be recorded. To calculate the test result, the average values of the incorrect distances in centimeters will be calculated.","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"Tecnobody Prokin 252 balance platform","description":"To measure balance performance, patients are given the Tecnobody Prokin 252 balance platform. The moving balance platform works with air piston servo motors. Thanks to the automatic engine locking function, the system instantly switches from dynamic measurement to static measurement and provides measurement of two different balances with objective results.","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"Berg Balance Scale (BDI) is a scale that contains 14 instructions and scores between 0-4 are given by observing the patient's performance for each instruction. A score of 0 is given when the patient cannot do the activity at all, while a score of 4 is given when the patient completes the activity independently. The highest score is 56, 0-20 points indicate imbalance, 21-40 points indicate acceptable balance, and 41-56 points indicate good balance. It takes between 10 and 20 minutes to complete the scale.","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"Timed-Up and Go Test","description":"It is one of the most frequently preferred evaluation methods as it is a test that includes movement maneuvers used in daily life. The test begins with a sitting position on a chair. The person is asked to get up from the chair he/she is sitting on, walk 3 meters at a safe and normal speed, turn, walk back and sit on the chair again. The time it takes to complete the test is recorded in seconds. While healthy individuals generally complete the test in less than 10 s, individuals who complete it in more than 30 s are classified as dependent on many activities of daily life and mobility skills.","timeFrame":"four weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Fall Activity Scale","description":"14 items (10 indoor and 4 outdoor activities) assess confidence when performing different daily tasks. Items on the scale are scored from 0 (unsafe) to 10 (completely safe) to rate participants' level of fall-related self-efficacy.","timeFrame":"four weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Volunteering to participate in the study\n* Volunteering to participate in the study\n* Being between the ages of 35-75\n* Being diagnosed with stroke\n* Having a stroke for the first time\n* Mini Mental Test (MMT) Score ≥ 24\n* Brunnstorm lower extremity stage ≥ 2\n* Being clinically stable\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Mini Mental Score \\< 24 points\n* Having additional hearing and vestibular system problems\n* Having problems with field of vision\n* Orthopedically sourced platinum etc. on his body. having had an operation\n* Having a cerebrum, cerebellar or spinal cord malignancy\n* Having additional neurological lesions (MS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's)\n* Mini Mental Score \\< 24 points\n* Having cervical pain of 5 or higher on the visual analog scale\n* Having serious vestibular, auditory and visual problems that affect balance (vertigo, etc.)\n* Having a history of orthopedic surgery for the trunk and lower extremities\n* Presence of an additional neurological disease (MS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's)\n* Having joint rigidity that prevents proprioceptive evaluation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"GÜLER ERTUĞRUL","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+90 531 950 05 90","email":"gertugrul004@gmail.com"},{"name":"MEHMET DURAY","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+90 506 473 11 65","email":"mehmetduray@sdu.edu.tr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"GÜLER ERTUĞRUL","affiliation":"Süleyman Demirel University Faculty of Health Sciences","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Güler Ertuğrul","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Kocaeli","state":"Gölcük","country":"Turkey","contacts":[{"name":"GÜLER ERTUĞRUL","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+90 531 950 05 90","email":"gertugrul004@gmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.62497,"lon":27.51145}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
