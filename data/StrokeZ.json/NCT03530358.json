Will be investigated whether there is a relationship between post-stroke cortical plasticity and changes in synergy activations due to a therapy.","detailedDescription":"It has been widely recognized that neurorehabilitation can facilitate recovery of motor function after stroke. There has been increasing evidence suggesting that the execution of voluntary movement relies critically on the functional integration of the motor areas and the spinal circuitries. More precisely, it was suggested that the central nervous system may generate neural motor commands through a linear combination of spinal modules, each of which activates a group of muscles as a single unit (muscle synergy). The investigators hypothesize that descending motor cortical signals generate movements by combining and activating muscle synergies. With this background, the goal is to further improve the efficacy of rehabilitation utilizing knowledge on modular motor control. The investigators also seek to provide a better understanding of the links between brain activations and movements.\n\nThe project MO-SE has three aims, one primary and two secondary. The main primary aim is to test whether the use of virtual reality rehabilitation based therapies are superior in terms of clinical efficacy to conventional therapies (randomized clinica trial, RCT). The other two secondary aims of the project will be accomplished with further instrumental analysis in sub-samples of the group of patients enrolled for the RCT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Upper Limb Injury","Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Muscle Synergies","MRI","Virtual Reality","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Clinical Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"A simple random number sequence will be generated by a computer and the allocation concealment will be guaranteed using sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes.
