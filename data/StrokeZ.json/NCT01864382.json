Their affected often have motor and sensory disturbances in the form of hemiparesis with a possible influence on the balance be altered trunk muscles, important components of postural control. The treatment of stroke, covers a wide range of different strategies and approaches physiotherapy, including, specific exercises on the trunk called \"core stability\", performed by the patient with the help and supervision of a physiotherapist specializing in neurology, that are based on coordination, motor and proprioceptive work, especially the lumbar-pelvic. The effectiveness of these last years has been demonstrated empirically, but until now there is no sufficient evidence of the effects of these exercises on sitting balance in respect, and standing up in the subacute phase post-stroke patients. To prove the evidence raises a randomized, multicenter, blinded and where the evaluator will not participate in the analysis and processing is done by intention to treat. Patients will be divided into two groups: control (usual physiotherapy center made ) and experimental (made also 15 minutes workout \"core stability\"). The intervention will have a frequency of 5 days a week for 5 weeks and up to 12 weeks. The expected effect is that the experimental group patients develop better postural control at the trunk and this influences the balance in sitting, standing and walking.","detailedDescription":"The deterioration in the balance sitting and poor sitting ability, clinical problems are common after stroke. These patients show a significant decrease in the performance level of the trunk, compared to healthy individuals of the same age and sex and present asymmetry of the trunk and pelvis.\n\nSitting involves the ability to achieve a variety of objects that are in and out of arm's length, as personal daily activities, showering, going to the bathroom and dressing. These arm movements, triggering postural adjustments in the muscles of the trunk and lower extremities, which anticipated the movement always precede the active movement. This anticipative control can be altered in subjects with stroke.\n\nThe trunk seems particularly important for balance, as stabilizes the pelvis and spine. Dean et al, (1997; 2007) and Ibrahimi (2010) showed a beneficial effect on functional scope of practice tasks, sitting in variables dynamic sitting balance, load weight of the affected side and standing. Also in the studies of Howe (2005); Verheyden (2009); Saeys (2011);Karthikbabu (2011) and Kumar (2011) with specific exercises for the trunk, favorable outcomes were obtained compared with standard treatment. However, these studies with few patients and without any monitoring, it needs to be confirmed (what is this study intended)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Trunk performance","exercise,","\"core stability\",","sitting balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Physiotherapy Exercises","type":"OTHER","description":"Standard Physiotherapy Exercises 5 days a week during 5 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: Standard Physiotherapy Exercises"]},{"label":"Core stability","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Core stability.5 days a week during 5 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: Core stability","Other: Standard Physiotherapy Exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Core stability","description":"Core stability 5 days a week during 5 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Core stability"],"otherNames":["Trunk exercises"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard Physiotherapy Exercises","description":"Standard Physiotherapy Exercises is a conventional treatment program 5 days a week during 5 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Core stability","Standard Physiotherapy Exercises"],"otherNames":["Usual care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dynamic sitting balance","description":"Trunk Impairment Scales:Is a tool to measure the motor impairment of the trunk after stroke, This scale evaluates dynamic sitting balance as well as co-ordination of trunk movement.","timeFrame":"Baseline, up to 25 sessions and follow up to 24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Standing balance","description":"Berg Balance Scale (BBS)assesses standing balance.
