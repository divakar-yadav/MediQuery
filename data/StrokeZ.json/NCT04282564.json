The main objective of this study is therefore to improve performance in significant activities of daily living for people with chronic post-stroke dysexecutive disorders.","detailedDescription":"Today, approaches to intervention with adults after stroke can be categorized into two groups: bottom-up approaches (neurodevelopmental, sensory integration, mental imagery, cognitive stimulation, perceptual-motor/kinesthetic training...) and top-down approaches (task-oriented approach, neuromotor task training, occupational performance coaching, the CO-OP approach). Although bottom-up intervention approaches have existed for several years longer than top-down approaches, in general, top-down intervention approaches have shown better results.\n\nIn the latest work with post-stroke adults with objective cognitive impairment, the data indicate the relevance of CO-OP in improving performance and satisfaction, attention, inhibition and flexibility or apathy.\n\nThis study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CO-OP approach in adult post-stroke patients in chronic phase, specifically on planning function, through the Single Case Experimental Design methodology by randomized intervention (3 patients) over 6 weeks of treatment and 10 weeks of evaluation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["CO-OP","executive functions","stroke","single-case experimental designs","transfer of knowledge","sens of self efficacy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CO-OP Arm (early phase A)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be integrated during the traditional day hospitalization follow-up, at the rate of 3 sessions per week.

The CO-OP protocol is composed of seven key characteristics: i) the goals chosen by the patient, ii) dynamic performance analysis, iii) the use of cognitive strategies, iv) guided discovery, v) the principles of empowerment, vi) the involvement of a relative, vii) the structure of the intervention (Polatajko and Mandich, 2004/2017).
