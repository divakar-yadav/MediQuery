This study will compare the use of multi-user virtual reality (VR) to single-user VR to determine if either provides superior engagement in upper extremity therapy and greater motivation to perform repetitive training.\n\nStroke survivors will participate in a longitudinal study in which they will have the opportunity to perform rehabilitative training with multi-user VR and single-user VR modes in their homes. They will use each mode for 2 weeks, completing 4 session per week, each session is 1 hour long. Upper extremity motor control, level of engagement, and active range of motion will be assessed at time points during the intervention period.\n\nSubject evaluations will take place before the intervention, at the midpoint of intervention (between switching from multi-user to single-user modes, or vice versa), and at the end of the intervention.\n\nThe investigators hope to address two aims:\n\nAim 1: To determine if the use in-home multi-user virtual reality treatment results in greater engagement in therapy compared with in-home single user virtual reality treatment.\n\nAim 2: To determine if in-home virtual reality treatment results in greater practice\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that stroke survivors will be more engaged in therapy when training with the multi-user VR system and this will translate into greater practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Virtual Reality Therapy","Rehabilitation","Upper Extremity","Arm","Telerehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single-User Mode first, Multi-User Mode second","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Single-User Virtual Reality Upper Extremity Therapy","Other: Multi-User Virtual Reality Upper Extremity Therapy"]},{"label":"Multi-User Mode first, Single-User Mode second","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Single-User Virtual Reality Upper Extremity Therapy","Other: Multi-User Virtual Reality Upper Extremity Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Single-User Virtual Reality Upper Extremity Therapy","description":"Virtual Reality games with the user as the only person required for participation","armGroupLabels":["Multi-User Mode first, Single-User Mode second","Single-User Mode first, Multi-User Mode second"],"otherNames":["Single-User Mode","Single-User Mode first, Multi-User Mode second","Multi-User Mode first, Single-User Mode second"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Multi-User Virtual Reality Upper Extremity Therapy","description":"Virtual reality games in which more than one user is required for participation.
