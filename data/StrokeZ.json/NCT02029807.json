The investigators will compare the algorithm with the blood loss tracked by a device called a flow meter.\n\nThe algorithm that runs on this system should be able to accurately keep track of stroke volume changes. The investigators will compare the algorithm with the stroke volume changes tracked by a device called a CCNexfin.\n\nThe algorithm that runs on this system should work whether it's in place for the whole blood donation, or if it's placed after the blood donation has started. The investigators will use two pulse oximeters for the system on each hand and compare one that is used for the whole blood donation versus one that is not used for the whole blood donation.","detailedDescription":"Hypothesis: p-values for testing the hypothesis of no correlation against the alternative that there is a nonzero correlation for each subject will be calculated. The minimum average power correlation, alpha = 0.05, will be used. Correlation will be made (CRI trend during 550ml blood volume removal) using pre and post blood draw data.\n\nSpecific Aims: These data will be submitted to the FDA with the following claims: The CRI algorithm\n\n1. Is intended for use by clinicians and medically qualified personnel to noninvasively display the trend of intravascular volume changes (hemorrhage)\n2.
