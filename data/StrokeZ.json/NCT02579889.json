Although many rate responsive (RR) sensors have been developed, no large clinical trials evaluated their benefits in terms of clinical endpoints such as clinically relevant atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke. Electromechanical sensors (piezoelectric accelerometers) have been widely used for their simplicity and overall reliability. However there is some evidence indicating the Closed Loop Stimulation as one of the more efficient and physiological sensors.\n\nTwo randomized clinical studies have been conducted so far, showing that in the Brady-Tachy Syndrome the CLS algorithm was associated with a significantly lower overall atrial arrhythmia burden as compared both with a DDDR mode based on a standard accelerometric sensor and an atrial overdrive approach.\n\nBoth studies yielded consistent results, albeit with a parallel and intraindividual comparison designs, respectively. The atrial arrhythmic burden is an important but surrogate endpoint, not necessarily related to long-term clinical outcome. The CLS effects on AF (if any) should be investigated in terms of time to first new onset of clinically relevant AF.\n\nIn the light of these considerations, it appears interesting to run a large randomized study coherently collecting data on the overall clinical benefit of CLS, primarily in terms of AF and stroke, in a population indicated for pacemaker or ICD and needing dual-chamber pacing due to SND."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sinus Node Disease"],"keywords":["Closed Loop Stimulation","Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke","Heart Failure","Pacemaker","ICD"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1390,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active group - CLS ON","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Device will be programmed in a dual-chamber DDD pacing mode with the Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) function ON; Intervention: DDD+CLS","interventionNames":["Device: DDD+CLS"]},{"label":"Control group - CLS OFF","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Device will be programmed in a dual-chamber DDD(R) pacing mode with the Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) function OFF","interventionNames":["Device: DDD(R)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DDD+CLS","description":"Device will be programmed in a dual-chamber DDD pacing mode with the Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) function ON","armGroupLabels":["Active group - CLS ON"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DDD(R)","description":"Device will be programmed in a dual-chamber DDD(R) pacing mode with the Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) function OFF","armGroupLabels":["Control group - CLS OFF"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"First event of Sustained Paroxysmal AF or Persistent AF or stroke or TIA, whichever comes first.","timeFrame":"three years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sustained Paroxysmal AF (SPAF)","description":"Assess the date of each events of SPAF occurred during the follow-up periods","timeFrame":"Three years"},{"measure":"Persistent AF","description":"Assess the date of each events of peristent AF occurred during the follow-up periods","timeFrame":"Three years"},{"measure":"Permanent AF","description":"Assess the date when AF is declared permanent","timeFrame":"Three years"},{"measure":"Stroke/TIA","description":"Assess the date of each events of stroke/TIA occurred during the follow-up periods","timeFrame":"Three years"},{"measure":"Worsening Heart failure Hospitalization (wHF-H)","description":"Assess the date of each events of wHF-H occurred during the follow-up periods","timeFrame":"Three years"},{"measure":"All cause mortality","timeFrame":"Three years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with Class I or II recommendations for permanent pacing due to SND, with or without AV block according to the current guidelines;\n* Patients for whom dual-chamber pacing is indicated or preferred;\n* Patients with an optimized and stable antiarrhythmic medical therapy at the time of enrolment;\n* Closed Loop Stimulation function was not previously activated;\n* No stroke events from implant;\n* Patient implanted for the first time;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Permanent AF (PermAF)\n* NYHA Class IV Heart Failure\n* Stage V kidney dysfunction\n* Any indication to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)\n* Life expectancy \\< 1\n* Minors\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding patients\n* Participation in another interventional trial\n* Atrial fibrillation ablation (left pulmonary veins) or other cardiac surgery \\< 3 m","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital","city":"Wuhan","state":"Jinghan District","zip":"430022","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":30.58333,"lon":114.26667}},{"facility":"The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University","city":"Harbin","state":"Nangang District","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":45.75,"lon":126.65}},{"facility":"Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University","city":"Beijing","state":"West City District","zip":"100053","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}},{"facility":"Semmelweis University Heart and Vascular Center","city":"Budapest","zip":"1122","country":"Hungary","geoPoint":{"lat":47.49801,"lon":19.03991}},{"facility":"Max Super Speciality Hospital","city":"New Delhi","zip":"110017","country":"India","geoPoint":{"lat":28.63576,"lon":77.22445}},{"facility":"Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona","city":"Torrette","state":"Ancona","zip":"60126","country":"Italy"},{"facility":"Ospedale Generale Regionale \"F.
