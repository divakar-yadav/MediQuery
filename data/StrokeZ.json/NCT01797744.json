There are indications that vestibular rehabilitation can have effect of neurological causes of dizziness and vertigo and it therefore seems important to find out if vestibular rehabilitation can affect dizziness among patients with stroke.\n\nThe aim of this study is to find out if vestibular rehabilitation can have any effect on function, balance and self-rated health among patients with first time stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dizziness"],"keywords":["Stroke","Dizziness","Vestibular rehabiliation","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vestibular rehabiliation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vestibular rehabiliation","interventionNames":["Other: Vestibular rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual rehabilitation whitout additional vestibular exercises"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Vestibular rehabilitation","description":"Usual rehabilitation and four different vestibular rehabilitation exercises, adapted to the individual patient","armGroupLabels":["Vestibular rehabiliation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale","description":"Questionnaire.

EQ5D consists of a descriptive system comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, severe problems. The patient indicates his/her state by marking the most appropriate statement. This result in a 1-digit number and the digits for the five dimensions can be combined in a five-digit number, generating 243 possible combinations of response.The EQ5D also consist of the EQ VAS where the patients' record self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the individual points can be used as a quantitative measure with zero as worst rated health and 100 as best rated health","timeFrame":"Change between baseline and three months after baseline"},{"measure":"The Berg Balance Scale","description":"Balance measures","timeFrame":"Change between baseline and three months after baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria\n\n• First time stroke with dizziness -\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Not first time stroke\n* No dizziness","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Lund University","city":"Malmö","zip":"205 02","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":55.60587,"lon":13.00073}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"University official website","url":"http://www.med.lu.se"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000014717","term":"Vertigo"},{"id":"D000004244","term":"Dizziness"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000012678","term":"Sensation Disorders"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000015837","term":"Vestibular Diseases"},{"id":"D000007759","term":"Labyrinth Diseases"},{"id":"D000004427","term":"Ear Diseases"},{"id":"D000010038","term":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7110","name":"Dizziness","asFound":"Dizziness","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17152","name":"Vertigo","asFound":"Dizziness","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15180","name":"Sensation Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18077","name":"Vestibular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10469","name":"Labyrinth Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10472","name":"Labyrinthitis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7291","name":"Ear Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12651","name":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC09","name":"Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
