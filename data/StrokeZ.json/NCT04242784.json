In the second phase, the project will be doing national and international surveys of best practices among comprehensive stroke centers and then combine evidence based guidelines and recommendation as well as expert consensus and guidelines when high level evidence is not available from the published literature. The aim to improve public stroke awareness, stroke symptom recognition within the time benefit window for treatment and calling 9-1-1, EMS transportation, and the proportion and speed of reperfusion therapy (fibrinolytic and in appropriate patients- endovascular treatment) in eligible patients. These improvements in acute stroke care delivery are expected to result in lower mortality, fewer recurrent strokes, and improved long term functional outcomes that we will measure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Intracranial Hemorrhages","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21646,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Spoke Hospital","description":"Patients that undergo the Code Stroke process at Spoke Hospitals"},{"label":"Hub Hospital","description":"Patients that undergo the Code Stroke process at Hub Hospitals"},{"label":"Transfer","description":"Patients that undergo the Code Stroke process at a Spoke Hospital and transfer to the Hub Hospital"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Time from door to drug as measured by medical record","description":"The time frame starting from the earliest time that the patient is documented as arriving to the hospital to the beginning time of the administration of the drug (TPA)","timeFrame":"From baseline (Q1, 2017), to Quarter 4 (2020)"},{"measure":"Change in Time from Door to Tici 2c/3 flow measured by medical record","description":"The time frame starting from the earliest time that the patient is documented as arriving to the hospital to the beginning time of Tici 2c/c flow noted in the vessel","timeFrame":"From baseline (Q1, 2017), to Quarter 4 (2020)"},{"measure":"Change in Time from Door to Administration of Reversal Agent as measured by medical record","description":"The time frame starting from the earliest time that the patient is documented as arriving to the hospital to the beginning time of the administration of the drug (reversal agent)","timeFrame":"From baseline (Q1, 2017), to Quarter 4 (2020)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Number of Deaths from Stroke as measure by medical record","description":"Count of number of deaths from stroke","timeFrame":"From baseline (Q1, 2017) to Quarter 4 (2020)"},{"measure":"Change in Functional Long Term Outcomes as measured by Modified Rankin Scale","description":"Modified Ranking Scale ranges from 0-6,\n\n0 No symptoms at all\n\n1.
