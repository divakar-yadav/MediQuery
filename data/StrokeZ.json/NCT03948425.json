distribution of iodine within the cerebral parenchyma in the patient suspected of acute ischemic disorder with the CT spectral scanner.\n* Correlate the anomalies of iodine mapping to the other parameters acquired during the classic dynamic infusion phase to define the ischemic area (MTT higher and rCBV normal) versus infarcted zone (MTT higher and rCBV decreased)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke,
