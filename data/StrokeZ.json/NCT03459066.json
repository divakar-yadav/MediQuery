It is a clinical sign of great complexity that generates disability, limiting the function and altering the quality of life of the subjects, generating great impact on families and society.\n\nIdentify times and characteristics of appearance; as well as its predictive factors can support an early intervention, orienting and strengthening the work of the rehabilitation team.\n\nDetermine the times of establishment, location and factors that favor the development of spasticity in acute stage and how it influences the functionality, quality of life and emotional level of post-stroke patients in hospital facilities.\n\nThrough this proposal, it is proposed to generate a new line of research that allows the development of scientific evidence in the area of neurorehabilitation, specifically in the field of spasticity, through the identification of establishment times, affected structures and predominant patterns in the extremities; as well as determining factors that favor the development of spasticity and its impact on post-stroke functionality and quality of life.\n\nThis information will strengthen the rehabilitative process of these subjects and the actions of the rehabilitation team, supporting the identification of preventive measures and implementing effective interventions that allow achieving better motor and functional results, in search of an optimal recovery.","detailedDescription":"A correlational (non-experimental), longitudinal, prospective follow-up design will be used for descriptive and predictive purposes.\n\nThe sample will consist of 150 subjects who meet the inclusion criteria, sign the informed consent and who will be treated during the year 2018 at the Hospital and the Clinic.\n\nThe study will include three measurement times: Time 1, during the first 10 days of hospitalization (T1); Time 2, at 3 months after T1; and Time 3, at 12 months after T1.\n\nAt each time of measurement, the study variables will be evaluated by 4 professionals trained in the following instruments: the Ashworth Scale to assess spasticity; To measure global functionality, the Barthel Index will be applied and, to assess functionality of the upper extremity, the Action Research Arm scale will be used; The Quality of Life Scale for Stroke-38 will be used to assess quality of life and emotional level. In addition, in time 1 the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample will be evaluated through a clinical record prepared for this purpose."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post Stroke Spasticity"],"keywords":["Spasticity","Stroke","Predictors","Functionality","Quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Institution-Group 8 district","description":"Group of patients belonging to institutions of district 8.
