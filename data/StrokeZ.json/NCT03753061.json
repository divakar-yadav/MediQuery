The trial is anticipated to last from November 2018 to May 2019, with 204 subjects recruited from 15-20 clinical trial centers in China.","detailedDescription":"This study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, end-point blinded, parallel positive controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial. Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who meet inclusion criteria would be enrolled in this study. Led by Beijing Tiantan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University, this study is planned to be carried out in 15-20 clinical trial institutions in China. There will be 102 patients enrolled in each group. Patients in the experimental group will be treated with the intracranial thrombus aspiration catheter, product of Hemo Jirui. Patients in the control group will be treated with stent retriever (Solitaire FR).\n\nIn this trial, relevant examinations of safety and efficacy assessments were performed immediately after the procedure, at 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Primary efficacy endpoint will be the immediate recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) of target vessel after the procedure. Secondary efficacy endpoints will include: (1) Proportion of functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days; (2) ordinal shift analysis of mRS at 90 days; (3) immediate recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) of the first pass of thrombectomy device; (4) immediate recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) of the last pass of thrombectomy device; (5)procedure time (randomization to recanalization); (6) Change in NIHSS score at 24hours; (7) Change in NIHSS score at 7 days or discharge (whichever comes first); (8) mTICI grading of target vessel revealed by CTA or MRA at 22-36 hours; (9) The extent of anterior circulation infarction at 22-36 hours, as measured by ASPECTS on CT or MRI. Safety endpoints will include: (1) All-cause mortality at 90 days; (2) stroke-related mortality at 90 days; (3) stroke recurrence rate within 90 days; (4) any type of intracranial hemorrhagic transformation within 22-36 hours, including parenchymal, subarachnoid or ventricular hemorrhage; (5) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 22-36 hours, as confirmed by any intracranial hemorrhage on CT or MRI associated with ≥ 4 points of worsening on NIHSS or even contributing to death; (5) procedural complications or serious adverse events procedural complications or serious adverse events (SAEs) within 90 days.\n\nThe trial is anticipated to last from November 2018 to May 2019, all the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Large Vessel Occlusion","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Large vessel occlusion","Acute ischemic stroke","Endovascular treatment","Mechanical thrombectomy","Aspiration Catheter"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":204,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aspiration Catheter","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy with Aspiration Catheter.","interventionNames":["Device: Aspiration Catheter"]},{"label":"Stent Retriever (Solitaire FR)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy with Solitaire FR.","interventionNames":["Device: Solitaire FR"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Aspiration Catheter","description":"Patients will be treated for mechanical recanalization with Aspiration Catheter within 8 hours after stroke onset plus standard medical management.","armGroupLabels":["Aspiration Catheter"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Solitaire FR","description":"Patients will be treated for mechanical recanalization with Solitaire FR within 8 hours after stroke onset plus standard medical management.","armGroupLabels":["Stent Retriever (Solitaire FR)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Instant recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) of target vessel after the procedure","timeFrame":"immediate"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Ordinal shift analysis of mRS at 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Instant recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) after the first thrombectomy","timeFrame":"immediate"},{"measure":"Instant recanalization rate (mTICI 2b-3) after the last thrombectomy","timeFrame":"immediate"},{"measure":"Procedure time (randomization to recanalization)","timeFrame":"procedure"},{"measure":"Change in NIHSS score at 24±2 hours","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Change in NIHSS score at 7±1 days or discharge (whichever comes first)","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"mTICI grading of target vessel revealed by CTA or MRA at 22-36 hours","timeFrame":"22-36 hours"},{"measure":"The extent of anterior circulation infarction at 22-36 hours, as measured by ASPECTS on CT or MRI","timeFrame":"22-36 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
