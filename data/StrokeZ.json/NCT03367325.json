The prevention of complications is based on oral or antiplatelet anticoagulant treatment. The first choice of anticoagulant therapy (AT) is the vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Contraindication to VKA or poor control of the International Normalized Ratio leads to the administration of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). There is a trend towards inadequate AT in non-valvular AF (NVAF) patients.\n\nThe Objective of the study is evaluate the impact of the implementation of a decision support tool linked to digital clinical history on the adequacy of AT, the incidence of complications and the mortality in patients with NVAF in primary health care of the Catalan Institute of Health (ICS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Anticoagulants","Clinical Decision Support Systems"],"keywords":["non-valvular atrial fibrillation","time in therapeutic range","primary care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":63001,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CDS-NVAF benefiting group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CDS-NVAF = Clinical decision support (CDS) tool for improving the adequacy of the anticoagulant therapy adequacy in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)","interventionNames":["Device: CDS-NVAF"]},{"label":"CDS-NVAF not-benefiting group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"CDS-NVAF","description":"The CDS-NVAF is intended for patients diagnosed with NVAF and treated with VKA.

At this time the TTR will be calculated automatically. If the TTR value is \\< 65%, a pop up screen with a warning text will open suggesting a change to DOAC therapy. The physician can decide whether to change or not the previous prescription. If the TTR value in \\> 65% the pop up screen will not appear. The TTR value will remain registered on the screen of the follow up of oral anticoagulant use and can be consulted in future queries.
