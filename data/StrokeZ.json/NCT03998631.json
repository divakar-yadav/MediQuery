Both procedures have a high risk of stroke and silent infarction. Gas has been detected in the cerebral vasculature during these procedures and associated with DWI positive lesions on MRI. The hypothesis is that air emboli contribute to stroke and silent infarction. The investigators propose addressing air emboli by flushing the device with carbon dioxide prior to flushing with saline. This is a pilot study comparing standard saline flush alone to carbon dioxide flushing with saline flush."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm","Aortic Stenosis Symptomatic","Stroke, Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Saline Flush","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"This is the control arm.
