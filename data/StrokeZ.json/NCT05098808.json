From these parameters we attempted (1) to define which of the PRAAT acoustic features best help to discriminate patients with dysphagia (2) to develop algorithms using sophisticated ML techniques that best classify those i) with dysphagia and those ii ) at high risk of respiratory complications due to poor cough force.","detailedDescription":"This study was prospective study, and patients who visited the department of rehabilitation medicine in a single university-affiliated tertiary hospital with dysphagic symptoms from September 2019 to March 2021 were included.Voice recording was performed at the enrollment with blinded assessment, where the participants first visited the rehabilitation department with chief complaints of dysphagia. The cough sounds were recorded with an iPad (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) through an embedded microphone.\n\nFrom the acoustic files we extracted fourteen voice parameters that include the average value and standard deviation of the fundamental frequency (f0), harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), the jitter that refers to frequency instability, and the shimmer that represents the amplitude instability of the sound signal.\n\nMachine learning algorithms and sophisticated deep neural network analysis will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Respiration Disorders","Swallowing Disorder","Phonation Disorder","Stroke","Aspiration Pneumonia","Aspiration; Liquids"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"7 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":449,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dysphagia mild","description":"Able to start oral feeding after assessment","interventionNames":["Other: Acoustic features (from signals obtained during phonation)"]},{"label":"Dysphagia severe","description":"Non oral feeding and high risk of aspiration","interventionNames":["Other: Acoustic features (from signals obtained during phonation)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Acoustic features (from signals obtained during phonation)","description":"Acoustic features will be obtained via phonation files.\n\nA voice recorder application provided by Apple was used, and the sampling frequency of the sound was 44,100 Hz.
