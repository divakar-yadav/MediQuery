Due to the known effect on ANS in case of pathologies of extracranial brain supplying arteries it is highly suspected that intracranial large artery occlusion and thrombectomy can affect the ANS as well.\n\nThe aim of this project is to determine autonomic parameters during and after thrombectomy in patients with large cerebral artery occlusion. The project is a prospective descriptive pilot study at the University Hospital Tulln. 20 patients will be assessed during and after thrombectomy up to three months post intervention. A combination of autonomic parameters, hemodynamic parameters and clinical outcome will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Autonomic Nervous System"],"keywords":["stroke","thrombectomy","autonomic nervous system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"autonomic nervous system testing","description":"* Autonomic tests, including heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), are performed with a 10min ECG with non-invasive or invasive blood pressor measuring during rest.

The patient will be instructed to exhale against a mouthpiece with a defined resistance for 15 seconds.\n* Assessment of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity will be done with continuous transcranial duplex sonography (TCD) and \"breath holding index\" (BHI).
