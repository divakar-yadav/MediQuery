Approximately 71% of stroke cases occur as a result of ischemic infarcts. Most survivors of stroke experience gait and balance disorders that increase the risk of falling.\n\nIt has been shown that the functional recovery of patients with stroke is adversely affected and length of hospital stay during the rehabilitation program, particularly in those with severe balance disorders.\n\nVirtual reality technologies are currently employed to accelerate functional recovery in patients.\n\nA total of 30 patients were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups with 15 patients in each group by simple randomization.\n\nGroup 1 received the conservative rehabilitation program, whereas Group 2 received a balance training program using the Thera-Trainer Balo (TTB) device along with the conservative rehabilitation program.\n\nPatient information regarding the age, gender, hemiplegic side, stroke duration, and type of ischemia were recorded. The stage of motor recovery according to Brunnstrom, spasticity based on the modified Ashworth scale, ambulation ability based on the Functional Ambulation Scale (FAS), quality of life based on the Short Form-36 (SF-36) scale, and balance-coordination status based on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and at the endpoint of the 8 week treatment. Moreover, evaluations were made with static and dynamic postural stability tests.\n\nThe study aimed to assess the effects of a virtual balance training program using the Thera-Trainer Balo (TTB) device along with conservative rehabilitation program on the clinical findings; standing, stepping, walking and balance measures; and activities of daily living in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conservative Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Only conservative rehabilitation treatment was applied to the patients in group 1.","interventionNames":["Other: Conservative rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Conservative Rehabilitation + Virtual Balance Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Conservative rehabilitation treatment and virtual balance study were applied to the patients in group 2.","interventionNames":["Other: Conservative rehabilitation","Device: Virtual Balance Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conservative rehabilitation","description":"The conservative rehabilitation program includes a patient-specific conservative exercise program comprising exercises that strengthen the paralyzed side, increase joint range of motion and strengthen muscles, stretch spastic muscles, and ensure balance rehabilitation that enhances balance performance and coordination.
