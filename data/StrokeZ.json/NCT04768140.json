Patients were divided into two groups and randomized into these groups. Only conventional physiotherapy was applied to the control group, whereas both conventional physiotherapy and Bobath exercises were also applied to the experimental group. Visual analog scale (horizontal) for shoulder pain, modified Ashworth scale for spasticity and Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity for functionality were used for both pre-test and post-test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["Hemiplegia","hemiplegic shoulder pain","neurodevelopmental treatment","spasticity","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED AND SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL The patients were blinded to their group allocation.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bobath group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A conventional physiotherapy program was applied to this group.
