It remains to be determined how such a complex interaction between touch and vision could be achieved effortlessly. In the present study, we will investigate how the motion information is transformed between touch and vision using the most novel approaches in human psychophysics, neuropsychology and monkey neurophysiology. Specifically, we will present tactile motion on primate fingerpads using a recently developed ball stimulator with a design in which we vary the direction of motion with respect to the skin surface and also vary the hand conformation and position. This setup allows us to systematically sample the possible scenarios involving coordinate transformation between the somatosensory and visual systems in conditions that could occur in hand exploration and object manipulation in daily life. We will present these tactile stimuli on normal human subject as well as stroke patients such as patients with spatial hemineglect. Finally, we will record from macaque monkeys in cortical areas that are thought to underlie the transformation of coordinates, such as the primary somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The results of the present study will contribute to the understanding of multisensory integration and the rehabilitation for patients with impaired use of spatial information."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["coordinate system","normal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hemineglect stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients with hemineglect"},{"label":"Control stroke patients","description":"Stroke patients without hemineglect"},{"label":"Normal control","description":"Normal subjects"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Perceived direction of tactile motion","description":"Detail description for time frame of assessment:\n\n(1) for stroke patients, the assessment will be performed \"in average\" 6 months after the onset of stroke (2) for normal subjects: assessment will be done when the subject is willing to participate (3) the subject might come to the lab more than once if the experiment can not be completed in one session\n\nAssessment:\n\nWe present tactile motion using tactile stimulators to (1)different digits (2)different hand conformations and (3) different hand positions relative to the trunk","timeFrame":"Once; specifically for stroke patients, 6 months after the onset of stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"For stoke patients\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke patients\n* stable medical condition\n* can cooperate in evaluation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* peripheral neuropathy\n* limb ambulation","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We will recruit 40 normal healthy adult subjects (equal to and more than 18 years old); the exclusion criteria are subjects with brain pathology, peripheral neuropathy and limb amputation.
