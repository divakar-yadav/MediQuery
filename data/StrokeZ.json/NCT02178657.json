The three groups of patients will be followed for 24 months. The randomization will be stratified depending on the NHSS score. This clinical trial has a voluntary substudy to obtain information on plasma biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cell therapy","Bone
