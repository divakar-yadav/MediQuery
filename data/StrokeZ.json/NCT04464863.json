Case group: Stroke patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the study during admission. The evaluation consists of a workout designed by expert rehabilitation physicians and neurologists that is performed by the patient in front of the Microsoft Kinect camera. The custom-built software Akira record the joint angles of body trunk and upper limbs during the workout. The kinematic data will be analyzed with a machine learning algorithm that classifies the participant according to the kinematic data in normal movement or impaired movement (with the degree of impairment) by age decade. Control group: healthy participants (without neurological or osteomuscular diseases) matched by age and sex with cases 1:1. The correlation between kinematic and clinical scales (NIHSS) and functional scales (modified Rankin Scale) will be analyzed. A secondary objective will be to analyze the predictive value of the kinematic measurements with the functional outcome at three months"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cases","description":"Acute stroke patients during the first week of evolution","interventionNames":["Other: Kinematic metrics"]},{"label":"Control","description":"Age and sex 1:1 healthy participants","interventionNames":["Other: Kinematic metrics"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Kinematic metrics","description":"kinematic metrics recorded with Kinect (register brand) and extracted with Akira (register brand)","armGroupLabels":["Cases","Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Kinematic metrics: join angles","description":"The kinect camera together with the software Akira will be used to automatically measure the degree angle of the following body joints: shoulder in abduction, shoulder inflexion, elbow in extension and in flexion and the angle formed by the forearm and the trunk with the shoulder in abduction.","timeFrame":"The change between the first week of index stroke (acute phase) and at 3 months after index stroke"},{"measure":"Kinematic metrics: movement acceleration","description":"The kinect camera together with the software Akira will be used to automatically measure the acceleration of the following movements: shoulder abduction and shoulder flexion.","timeFrame":"The change between the first week of index stroke (acute phase) and at 3 months after index stroke"},{"measure":"Kinematic metrics: movement pattern","description":"The kinect camera together with the software Akira will be used to automatically measure the pattern of the following movements: trunk oscillation during standing position and during walking; and trunk oscillation during seating position with opened and closed eyes.","timeFrame":"The change between the first week of index stroke (acute phase) and at 3 months after index stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relationship of kinematic measures with the degree of disability after stroke.","description":"Correlation between the kinematic metrics described before (joint angles, movement acceleration and movement pattern) and the degree of disability, measured y the modified Rankin scale.
