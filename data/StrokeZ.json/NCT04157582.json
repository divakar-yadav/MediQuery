Individuals can recover from physical disability resulting from stroke, but might be unable to return to their previous occupations or independent life because of cognitive impairments.\n\nPost-stroke cognitive impairment is not a unitary syndrome but incorporates a variety of deficits in multiple domains such as attention, executive functions , memory, language and visuoperceptual abilities. Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 64% of people who have had a stroke and has been associated with a 3-fold increase in risk for mortality, institutionalization and decreased instrumental activities of daily living function.\n\nPilates training was developed by Joseph H. Pilates .It belong to a group of so-called Body-Mind Exercises, where the focus is on controlled movement, posture, and breathing .Pilates (pronounced: puh-lah-teez) improves mental and physical well-being , increases flexibility through controlled movements done as mat exercises.\n\nPilates training improve cognitive functions through increasing blood and oxygen flow to the brain , support neuronal survival in the developping brain ,Generate new neurons ,Provides mood enhancement ,Increases neurotransmitters and Neurotrophins assure the survival of neurons in areas responsible for learning, memory and higher thinking."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"will consist of 20 hemiparetic patients and will receive Pilates training in addition to conventional physical therapy program consists of (manual stretching exercises, Strengthening Exercises and Wobble board training ) for 18 sessions every other day for one and half month , 3 sessions /week ,each session for 1.30 hours (40 minutes for pilates then 10 minutes rest then 40 minutes conventional physical therapy).","interventionNames":["Other: Pilates training","Other: Conventional physical therapy"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"will consist of 20 hemiparetic patients and will receive conventional physical therapy program only same as group I for 18 sessions every other day for one and half month, 3 sessions /week, each session for (40 minutes ).","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Pilates training","description":"1.
