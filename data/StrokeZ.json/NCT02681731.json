Determine the incremental increase in the length of hospitalization and cost of hospitalization among cardiac surgical patients who suffer postoperative cognitive complications, acute kidney injury and stroke; and\n3. Determine the effectiveness of intraoperative neuromonitoring with cerebral saturation and/or processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring on the incidence of post-operative cognitive complications, acute kidney injury and stroke as a consequence of specific cardiac surgery procedures.\n\nThe Premier Healthcare Database is a privately owned database that represents approximately 1/5th of all United States hospitalizations annually. It includes all International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision (ICD-9) and International Classification of Diseases-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes recorded by the hospital, as well as a limited set of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-4 codes. Within the database, discharge-level data include information on patient and provider characteristics, diagnoses and procedures, hospital resource utilization, and charges/cost data for all entries, including pharmacy charges."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Delirium","Stroke","Acute Kidney Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250000,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Delirium: Incidence of post-operative cognitive complications identified by ICD-9 diagnosis code","description":"Incidence of post-operative cognitive complications identified by International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) diagnosis code","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Acute Kidney Injury: Incidence of acute kidney injury identified by ICD-9 diagnosis code","description":"Incidence of acute kidney injury identified by ICD-9 diagnosis code","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Stroke: Incidence of stroke identified by ICD-9 diagnosis code","description":"Incidence of stroke identified by ICD-9 diagnosis code","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All adult (age \\>=18 years) hospitalized patients who underwent major cardiac surgical procedure requiring cardiopulmonary bypass captured in the premier database from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2014 (5 year period)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\<18 years of age\n* Cardiac procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All adult (age \\>=18 years) inpatients who underwent major cardiac surgical procedure requiring cardiopulmonary bypass captured in the Premier database from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2014 (5 year period).","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Andrew Shaw, MB FRCA","affiliation":"Vanderbilt University School of Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Vanderbilt University School of Medicine","city":"Nashville","state":"Tennessee","zip":"37212","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":36.16589,"lon":-86.78444}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"There is no individual participant data in this retrospective database study."}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000058186","term":"Acute Kidney Injury"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000051437","term":"Renal Insufficiency"},{"id":"D000007674","term":"Kidney Diseases"},{"id":"D000014570","term":"Urologic Diseases"},{"id":"D000052776","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000052801","term":"Male Urogenital Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M28688","name":"Acute Kidney Injury","asFound":"Acute Kidney Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6584","name":"Delirium","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26408","name":"Renal Insufficiency","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10388","name":"Kidney Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17009","name":"Urologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2876","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26783","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13817","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8089","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26785","name":"Male Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
