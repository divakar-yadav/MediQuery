The intervention consists of a structured therapeutic chain of 290 collaborating GPs, a standardised acute hospital proceeding overlapping with an early integrated neurovascular rehabilitation within the same institution. Primary endpoints include death and dependence at 6 months, secondary endpoints are the length of hospital stay (LOS) and the quantitative analysis of physical and psychosocial impairments. The data are directly compared with the same endpoints of the Swiss subgroup of the international stroke trial (IST)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke treatment","Rehabilitation","Stroke chain","Stroke unit"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"structured therapeutic chain of stroke treatment"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality, dependence, psychoscial outcome"},{"measure":"Mortality, dependence and psychosocial outcome","timeFrame":"6 months endpoint"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* An acute cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke or intra-cerebral bleeding (ICB)) with the signs and symptoms of an acute stroke according to the World Health Organisation definition of acute stroke14 within the last 12 hours without the need or possibility of a neurosurgical intervention\n* No thrombolytic therapy within the first 3 hours (in order to allow the correct comparison with the Swiss cohort of the IST trial\n* The informed consent of the patient or, if not possible, of the relatives\n* Living at home before the event\n* Lack of participation in another trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Thrombolytic therapy within the first 3 hours (in order to allow the correct comparison with the Swiss cohort of the IST trial\n* No informed consent of the patient or, if not possible, of the relatives\n* Not living at home before the event\n* Participation in another trial (26 patients were excluded because of TIA with full recovery within 24 hours after the event)","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Juerg H.
