Bone mineral density, a measure of bone health, has been reported to decrease after stroke, consistent with increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone mineral density and balance, functional ambulation and falls in hemiparetic patients with stroke in the subacute and chronic phases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["stroke","osteoporosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients with a history of falls","description":"Demographic characteristics and medical histories (age, height, weight, smoking, alcohol use, comorbidities, medications, stroke onset date, stroke side, total number of rehabilitation received, assistive device use, history of falls) of all patients participating in the study will be recorded.\n\nDetailed physical examinations (mini-mental status assessment, brunstrum stages, spasticity assessments, orthosis use) will be performed.
