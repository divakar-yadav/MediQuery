Nevertheless, the amount of therapeutic activity with clinicians' guidance is often short of number in therapy sessions.Therefore, using Internet of Things (IoT), connected rehabilitation products and the data they generate that are a new trend of rehabilitation strategy for providing remote home-programs support. The specific aim of this study is to to explore the feasibility of introducing the rental services of a Smart Home-based Exoskeleton Robot System through the IoT business model. And the second purpose is to investigate the effects of applying the exoskeleton robotic device for tenodesisgrip training as a home-based treatment for chronic stroke patients.The expected outcomes of this research are to clarify the feasibility of using IoT business model for launching smart rehabilitation device rental service and the effects of application a high dosage of hand movement training as home program on motor and hand function for patients with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rehabilitation, Tenodesis, Stroke, Internet of Things"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot training with Smart Home-based Exoskeleton Robot System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to receiving hospital occupational therapy training twice a week, the participants will receive 60 minutes of home-based robot assisted tenodesis-grip training per day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks .","interventionNames":["Other: occupational therapy"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In addition to receiving hospital occupational therapy training twice a week, the participants will receive 60 minutes of home-based specific motor task training per day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks .","interventionNames":["Other: occupational therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"occupational therapy","description":"occupational therapy targeted to goals that are relevant to the functional needs of the patient","armGroupLabels":["Robot training with Smart Home-based Exoskeleton Robot System","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the result of Box and blocks test","description":"The score is the number of blocks carried from one box to the other in one minute.
