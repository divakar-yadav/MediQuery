Purpose: The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the immediate effects of a session of tDCS over the primary motor cortex combined with functional electrical simulation (FES) on electrical activity of the tibialis anterior muscle, balance and distribution of plantar pressure in individuals with hemiparesis stemming from a stroke. A further aim is to determine whether the effects of the combination of both stimulation methods are better than those achieved when each method is employed alone. Methods/design: A randomized, double-blind, crossover, cross-sectional study will be conducted involving 30 stroke survivors with hemiparesis who meet the eligibility criteria. Evaluations will involve an identification and screening chart, the classification of motor impairment using the Fugl-Meyer Scale, the determination of spasticity of the triceps surae muscle (modified Ashworth scale), electromyography of the tibialis anterior muscle, static balance and cognitive dual-task balance (stabilometry) and plantar pressure. After the initial evaluations, the participants will undergo four interventions: 1) anodal tDCS + placebo FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; 2) placebo tDCS + active FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; 3) anodal tDCS + active FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; and 4) placebo tDCS + placebo FES placebo + active tibialis anterior contraction. tDCS will be administered over the primary motor cortex and FES will be administered over the tibialis anterior muscle. The order of the different protocols will be randomized and both the evaluator and patients will be blinded to which protocol is being administered."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["STROKE"],"keywords":["Transcranial direct current stimulation","functional electrical stimulation","hemiparesis","electromyography","balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1- tDCS 2--FES","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
