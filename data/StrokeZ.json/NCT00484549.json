A screening of this disease allows patients to benefit from an enzyme replacement therapy and prevent the occurrence of life threatening manifestations such as an ischemic stroke.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to determinate the prevalence of Fabry disease in a population of male patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke.\n\nThis study, with a screening of Fabry disease, allows the patients to make a precise diagnosis of their ischemic stroke and to facilitate the screening of the other members at the facility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke Hospitalized"],"keywords":["Fabry disease, Screening, Ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":889,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Blood sample","description":"Ischemic stroke hospitalized"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fabry disease's screening (Positive microdosage confirmed by a macrodosage)","timeFrame":"Positive microdosage confirmed by a macrodosage"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Describe and compare the characteristics of patients affected by Fabry disease and patients who are not affected Identify clinical and neuroradiological predictive elements of Fabry disease","timeFrame":"patients affected by Fabry disease"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hospitalized ischemic stroke\n* Written and signed informed consent from patient or legal representative\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients belonging to a family which has a Fabry disease's diagnosis confirmed","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"28 Days","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pierre Clavelou, Pr","affiliation":"Unaffilliated","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"HÃ´pital Gabriel Montpied","city":"Clermont-Ferrand","zip":"63003","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.77966,"lon":3.08628}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"16710123","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Clavelou P, Besson G, Elziere C, Ferrier A, Pinard JM, Hermier M, Artigou JY, Germain DP.
