It causes narrowing of the small blood vessels and can lead to strokes and dementia. Researchers want to monitor people with CADASIL over time.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about how CADASIL affects a person s blood vessels over time.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older who have CADASIL, and healthy volunteers.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical record review.\n\nParticipants will have 4 study visits over 9 years. Visits will last 6 8 hours per day, for 2 4 days.\n\nParticipants will give blood and urine samples. They will have an electrocardiogram to record their heart s electrical activity. They will fill out a family tree. They will have tests that measure mental abilities like memory and attention. They may have a skin biopsy. They may have a lumbar puncture.\n\nParticipants will have an eye exam. Their pupils will be dilated. They will receive a dye via intravenous (IV) line. Pictures will be taken of their eyes.\n\nParticipants will have an imaging scan of their brain. They may receive a contrast agent via IV.\n\nParticipants blood flow and blood vessel flexibility will be measured. In one test, a probe will be pressed against the skin of the their wrist, neck, and groin. In another test, they will hold one arm still while a microscope makes videos of the blood flow through a fingernail. In another test, they will perform light exercise or other activities while wearing an elastic band around their head or probes placed on their arm or leg.\n\nHealthy volunteers will complete some of the above tests.","detailedDescription":"Study Description:\n\nThis is a disease discovery/natural history protocol. We will enroll 100 CADASIL subjects to perform in-depth prospective and retrospective evaluations for research purposes. Some evaluations will be compared to healthy controls.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: This study will examine the pathogenesis and progression of CADASIL through comprehensive evaluations, and molecular studies on biospecimens collected from affected individuals.\n\nSecondary Objective: Comprehensive evaluations will be used to investigate variability of the genotype and clinical phenotype of CADASIL during the study period.\n\nExploratory Objective: Healthy controls may be used for comparison for some of the research testing where data on normal values is lacking. Healthy controls will not be used to establish normal range values but for qualitative comparison with CADASIL population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Disease","Arterial Stiffness","Germline Mutation in the NOTCH 3 Gene","Pathogenesis of CADASIL","Clinical Phenotype of CADASIL"],"keywords":["Biospecimen Procurement","Laboratory Research Specimens","progressive chronic hypoperfusion","Stroke","progressive white matter degeneration, and debilitating dementia."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy controls","description":"Healthy controls for exploratory analyses, where the measurements were not commonly performed previously in other populations, for qualitative comparison with CADASIL population"},{"label":"Subjects with CADASIL","description":"Adult genetically-confirmed patients with a wider range of CADASIL disease duration and debility"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"This study will examine the pathogenesis of CADASIL through comprehensive clinical evaluations and molecular studies on biospecimens collected under this protocol from affected individuals.","description":"To study the pathogenesis of CADASIL and obtain clinical evaluations and biospecimens from affected cohorts to identify underlying disease mechanism(s).","timeFrame":"13 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical evaluations will be used to investigate variability of clinical phenotype during the study period.","description":"To use Clinical evaluations to investigate variability of clinical phenotype during the study period.
