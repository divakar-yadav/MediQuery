In part, these balance problems may be due to sensory issues. This study will test whether sensory augmentation has the potential to improve post-stroke balance. Sensory augmentation is a method by which non-invasive vibration is used to enhance the sensory information available to users, which may make it easier to feel where they are and prevent losses of balance.","detailedDescription":"The objective of this study is to design a novel multisensory augmentation approach to improve the control of standing balance in people with chronic stroke. With sensory augmentation, artificial feedback provides the nervous system with information about the dynamic state of the body, which can be used to prevent losses of balance. This clinical trial will investigate whether multisensory augmentation produces sustained balance improvements when applied as a training device. These potential improvements will be assessed by comparing the results of clinical and biomechanical assessments before and after a 10-week balance training program, in which half of the participants will be randomly assigned sensory augmentation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomly assigned to either a Control or an Experimental group.
