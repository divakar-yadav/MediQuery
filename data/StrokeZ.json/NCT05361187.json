Immediate treatment is needed to restore the blood circulation in the brain, performing a mechanical removal of the clot (thrombectomy). To prevent clot particles migrating in other parts of the brain circulation during the thrombectomy, balloon guiding catheters are inserted. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the balloon guide catheter BOBBY™ by collecting information from patients, treated with a mechanical thrombectomy and the balloon guide catheter (BOBBY™) after acute ischemic stroke","detailedDescription":"The main objective of the STRAIT study is to assess the performance of the mechanical thrombectomy using a BOBBY™ Balloon Guide Catheter (BGC) as adjunctive device for endovascular treatment of patients suffering from an anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Interventional procedures and clinical follow-up will be performed per standard of care. Patient health-related and imaging data will be collected as of stroke onset time up to 90 days follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular
