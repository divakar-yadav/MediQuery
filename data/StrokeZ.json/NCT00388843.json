The researchers will correlate the change in plaque volume to degree of LDL lowering. The researchers will also study if brief treatment will lead to change in plaque composition. The researchers will compare the change in plaque volume measured by 3T MRI with plaque burden measured by ultrasound.","detailedDescription":"Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis develops with increasing plaque burden and eccentric arterial wall expansion or remodeling, later leading to luminal obstruction. More than 90% of patients with CAD have carotid plaques. Statins have been shown to cause plaque regression in the carotid and coronary arteries. However, there is ongoing controversy about how low the target LDL should be in atherosclerotic patients. The benefits of aggressive LDL lowering with higher statin doses are counterbalanced by the potential for liver and muscle toxicity. High field (3 Tesla) MRI is a promising new modality for measuring plaque volume with high spatial resolution. It is not clear whether increasing statin dose will lead to plaque volume reduction in the short-term (6 months) that can be measured by this new modality.\n\nThe primary aim of the study is to determine if LDL lowering using statins in vascular disease patients with carotid plaque will be associated with measurable reduction in carotid plaque volume in the short term (6 months) using 3T MRI.\n\nThe four secondary aims of the study are as follows:\n\nTo compare the short term carotid plaque volume change using high field MRI in vascular disease patients whose statin dose was increased (dose increased) versus those whose statin dose was maintained (dose maintained).\n\nTo determine if increasing statin dose in patients with carotid plaque will lead to measurable change in carotid plaque composition in the short term (6 months) using 3T MRI.\n\nTo compare the carotid plaque volume change using 3T MRI with change in plaque burden score using carotid ultrasound .\n\nTo determine the relationship between change in plaque volume with change in lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL) and change in inflammatory markers (cytokines, high sensitivity CRP).\n\nThe study is significant because it will provide insight into optimal statin treatment for atherosclerotic disease. It will also test a new modality for measurement of plaque burden. A reliable and sensitive test with high spatial resolution that accurately measures change in plaque volume will be helpful in assessing response to treatment and as a tool for future clinical trials in assessing efficacy of new treatment modalities that may reduce the need for expensive, long term studies that rely on clinical events for outcome measurement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Atherosclerosis"],"keywords":["carotid atherosclerosis","magnetic resonance
