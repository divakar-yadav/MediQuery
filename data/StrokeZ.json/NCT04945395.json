It will be led from the University Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Danderyd Hospital (RMDS) in collaboration with the MoveAbility Lab at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Patients referred to RMDS for inpatient rehabilitation early after hemiparetic stroke will be included.\n\nThe overall aim is to explore how 4 weeks of training incorporating the FES-system (L300 Go System ® Bioness, Ottobock) effect function of the lower extremity, gait function and mobility when compared to conventional training only, in the subacute stage after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Participants will be included and allocated to either experimental group with training incorporating the FES-system and conventional training or to control group with conventional training only. Data will be collected before and after the intervention at RMDS and at the MoveAbility Lab. Physical tests and self-scored questionnaires of self-perceived aspects of functioning and disability will be performed at RMDS and gait analysis with 3D cameras and assessment of muscle function with EMG will be performed at the MoveAbilityLab. In addition, a short assessment of body function and activity will be performed weekly at RMDS by the therapist responsible for the rehabilitation intervention.\n\nThe experimental group will wear the FES-system L300 Go at all times when the patient is taking part in rehabilitation interventions involving the lower extremity led or instructed by a physiotherapist. The settings will be adjusted by the employee from the technical company and/or the physiotherapist continuously during the intervention if needed. The system will register the distance and time accomplished during each session. Due to risk of skin irritation, if the system is overused in the beginning the experimental group will have access to an ankle-foot-orthosis too.\n\nThe control group will wear an ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) and receive conventional training. The control group will wear a FES-system too, to record the distance and time accomplished during each session, but the system will not be active for stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ambulation Difficulty","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Functional electrical stimulation","Walking","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessor will be blinded to the patients´ allocation in terms of intervention","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FES and conventional training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group will wear the Functional electrical stimulation system L3100 Go for dorsiflexion of the ankle during conventional rehabilitation interventions involving the lower extremity led or instructed by a physiotherapist.","interventionNames":["Device: FES and Conventional training"]},{"label":"AFO and Conventional training only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will wear an ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) to enhance dorsiflexion of the foot while taking part in conventional rehabilitation interventions involving the lower extremity led or instructed by a physiotherapist.","interventionNames":["Device: AFO and Conventional training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"FES and Conventional training","description":"The experimental group will be fitted with the Functional electrical stimulation system L300 Go to be used during 4 weeks of inpatient rehabilitation in the subacute phase after hemiplegic stroke.
