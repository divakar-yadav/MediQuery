Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using aspirin and a thienopyridine in the initial period after TAVI is the recommended strategy; however, mono antiplatelet therapy using aspirin is suggested not to be inferior. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or another indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC), no recommendations on best treatment regimen currently exist although triple therapy (OAC + DAPT) is best avoided due to increased bleeding risk.\n\nWe hypothesise that the omission of clopidogrel in the first 3 months after TAVI is safer and not less beneficial than the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin (cohort A) or OAC (cohort B).","detailedDescription":"The trial consists of two cohorts:\n\n* Cohort A, patients without an indication for OAC prior to TAVI.\n* Cohort B, patients with an indication for OAC prior to TAVI (eg. atrial fibrillation, mechanic mitral valve prosthesis)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Bleeding"],"keywords":["Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)","Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)","Aortic Valve Disease","Aortic Stenosis","Myocardial Infarction","Ischemic stroke","Bleeding","Thrombosis","Myocardial Ischemia","Heart Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Embolism and Thrombosis","Aspirin","Clopidogrel","Prasugrel","Ticagrelor","Antithrombotic treatment","Oral anticoagulation","Warfarin","Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors","Genetic Testing","Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19)","Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2(PTGS2)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1016,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aspirin + Clopicogrel (Cohort A)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cohort A: patients will receive clopidogrel (75mg quaque die (qD), 3 months) on top of low-dose aspirin (≤100mg qD, at least 1 year but recommended lifelong).
