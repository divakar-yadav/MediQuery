This study compares the effectiveness of two behavior-based programs to improve picture naming ability in these individuals.","detailedDescription":"Difficulty finding words is common in patients with aphasia subsequent to left hemisphere stroke. This study will compare two cognitive therapies for the treatment of acquired word finding difficulties. The therapies use different types of cues. All participants will receive both therapies. Participants in this study will undergo a comprehensive and detailed assessment of language and other cognitive skills. The two treatments will be compared for their efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anomia","Aphasia","Traumatic Brain Injury","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Anomia","Aphasia","Traumatic Brain Injury","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":78,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Errorful training condition","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A type of anomia rehabilitation paradigm which allows for errors.
