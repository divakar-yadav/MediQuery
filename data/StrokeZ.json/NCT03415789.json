The flow stasis accompanying ventricular remodeling and myocardial dysfunction could favor the formation of small intracavitary thrombi between LV trabeculae, small enough not be detected by conventional imaging techniques. Computational post-processing techniques allow a robust and complete characterization of numerous aspects of fluid dynamics within the heart using the flow field obtained by Echo or MRI imaging, and it is possible to quantify the stasis and washing of blood in the left ventricular cavity.\n\nA cross-sectional study in 80 patients with non-ischemic DCM in sinus rhythm is proposed in which an echocardiogram, cardiac and cerebral MRI will be performed. Our objective is to quantify the ventricular stasis by post-processing of 2D color Doppler echocardiography images in order to establish the relationship between quantifiable intraventricular stasis variables and the prevalence of silent and embolic events and intracavitary thrombosis determined by magnetic resonance (MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dilated Cardiomyopathy","Thrombosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy","Cardiac thrombosis","Silent brain infarct","Fluid dynamics","Intracardiac blood flow","Echocardiography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"80 patients non ischemic DCM","description":"A cohort of 80 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in sinus rhythm with left ventricle ejection fraction (EF) less than 45%.\n\nIn the first 24 hours after enrollment a coagulation blood test, an electrocardiogram, a Doppler echocardiogram exam and a clinical examination (including neuropsiquiatric evaluation) will be performed.\n\nA cardiac magnetic resonance and a brain magnetic resonance will be performed within 10 days after the enrollment.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Doppler echocardiogram exam","Diagnostic Test: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance","Diagnostic Test: Brain Magnetic Resonance","Diagnostic Test: Coagulation blood test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Doppler echocardiogram exam","description":"A complete echocardiographic study will be performed at enrollment.
