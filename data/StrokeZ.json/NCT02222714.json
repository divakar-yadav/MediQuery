This study used a modified version of the continual reassessment method (CRM) in order to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\n\nEligible subjects received 3K3A-APC or placebo every 12 hours for up to 5 doses (approximately 3 days), or until discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first. Subjects were monitored for safety evaluations through Day 7 (or discharge, if earlier) and were expected to be seen on Day 7, 14, 30, and 90 for safety and outcome evaluations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","stroke","APC","3K3A","3K3A-APC","activated protein C","RHAPSODY"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"120 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3K3A-APC, q12h for up to 5 doses","interventionNames":["Biological: 3K3A-APC"]},{"label":"240 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3K3A-APC, q12h for up to 5 doses","interventionNames":["Biological: 3K3A-APC"]},{"label":"360 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3K3A-APC, q12h for up to 5 doses","interventionNames":["Biological: 3K3A-APC"]},{"label":"540 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3K3A-APC, q12h for up to 5 doses","interventionNames":["Biological: 3K3A-APC"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Matching placebo, q12h for up to 5 doses","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"3K3A-APC","description":"3K3A-APC, diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride in water, given as 100 mL IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["120 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","240 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","360 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC","540 µg/kg of 3K3A-APC"],"otherNames":["3K3A-Activated Protein C"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Matching placebo, 0.9% sodium chloride in water, given as 100 mL IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Matching Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events That Meet Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) Criteria Specified in Protocol","description":"Specific AEs in the study were defined in the protocol to be dose-limiting toxicity events.
