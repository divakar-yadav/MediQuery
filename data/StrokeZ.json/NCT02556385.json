This goal can be achieved by using an excitatory protocol to reactivate the perilesional area or inhibitory protocol to reduce activities in the contralesional area. However, most conventional rTMS studies employed an inhibitory low frequency protocol for the contralesional homologs of Broca's area.\n\nIn the present pilot study, investigators will perform functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) prior to rTMS treatment for selection of the most appropriate application of stimulation. Stimulation site and protocol (high frequency or low frequency rTMS) will be determined by activation pattern from the fNIRS findings with language task in individual patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High
