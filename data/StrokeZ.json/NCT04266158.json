During the study, subjects will undergo general training in the operation of the EMG-controlled orthosis and the comparison orthosis, and then guided through a series of standard clinical outcome measures. These outcome measures will allow the researchers to directly compare the relative benefit of the MyoPro 2 Motion G with a resting hand splint and no device in reducing UE impairment and increasing UE dexterity and functional task performance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Paresis","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MyoPro 2 Motion-G-orthosis-None","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Following screening, all subjects receive 2 education sessions, during which they are trained on the donning and use of the MyoPro 2 Motion-G, Comfy Splint orthosis, and no device, all on the affected UE.
