A total of 519 consecutive patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, aortic valve replacement or combined aortic valve with coronary bypass surgery in Kuopio University Hospital from 2004 to 2008. Patients with previous episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter and also patients with mitral valve surgery were excluded. All patients had continuous postoperative ECG monitoring for at least 48 hours. AF episodes lasting longer than 5 minutes were registered. Thereafter 12 lead ECG was recorded daily and in case of symptoms of rhythm disturbances.\n\nMedical records were reviewed during 2012 using standardized data collection protocol. Statistics Finland database was used for mortality data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Death","Stroke","Myocardial Infarction"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","CABG","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"105 Months","enrollmentInfo":{"count":519,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"cardiovascular and all-cause death","timeFrame":"1-105 month"},{"measure":"stroke","timeFrame":"1-105 month"},{"measure":"late atrial fibrillation","timeFrame":"1-105 month"},{"measure":"myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"1-105 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* previously cardiac operation, CABG or AVR\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous Atrial fibrillation","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients without preoperative history of atrial fibrillation, participated in three different randomized controlled trials previously","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"},{"id":"D000009203","term":"Myocardial Infarction"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6535","name":"Death","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","asFound":"Myocardial Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
