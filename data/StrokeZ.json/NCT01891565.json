Observational studies have found that in the first 14 days post stroke, patients receive very little therapy and have very low activity levels. More opportunity to practice may, however, improve short-term outcomes such as the level of mobility, endurance, use of the affected arm and leg, and length of stay. The Stroke Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity (SIRRACT) trial will utilize sensors that reveal the type, quantity, and aspects of quality of patient activities outside of the confines of research laboratories. SIRRACT will deploy inexpensive Personal Activity Monitors (PAMs), comprised of triaxial accelerometers worn on the thighs.\n\nThe objectives of the study are:\n\ni. To assess the impact of feedback from Personal Activity Monitors (PAM)s on amount of active practice, walking speed and distance in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\nii. To assess the impact of feedback from PAMs on physical, psycho-emotional, cognitive and ecosocial Health-Related Quality of Life of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\niii. To assess the acceptability of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\niv. To assess the reliability and validity of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\nHypotheses In moderate to severely disabled subjects who are receiving in-patient rehabilitation, daily feedback from PAMs about purposeful activity will increase the amount of active practice by \\>30%, a higher proportion of subjects who reach the level of independence for walking, and increase walking speed by 25%, leading to higher mean walking speeds and distances at the time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Daily feedback from PAMs on increase in walking speed and distances will improve physical, psychological, cognitive and ecosocial domains of Health-related quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Activity Feedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Feedback","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Feedback"]},{"label":"No Feedback","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Feedback","armGroupLabels":["Activity Feedback"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in walking speed","timeFrame":"Baseline, Two weeks, Discharge, 1 month"},{"measure":"Change in Health-Related Quality of Life as measured using HRQOLISP-26","timeFrame":"Baseline, Two weeks, Discharge, 1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Admission for acute inpatient neurorehabilitation of a first stroke (or second stroke after full recovery from prior Transient Ischemic Attack/Stroke).\n* Time from onset of stroke to admission for rehabilitation \\<35 days.\n* Stroke from any cause (thrombotic infarct, cardioembolism, intracerebral hemorrhage) that includes unilateral hemiparesis.
