While recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or rt-PA, is the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke, less than 2-3 percent of individuals with stroke actually receive treatment. The inability to capture acute ischemic stroke cases within 3 hours of symptom onset is one critical factor. Populations at highest risk for stroke are significantly undereducated about the need for rapid, intervention upon onset of stroke symptoms. This is especially true among vulnerable populations including African Americans, Hispanics, and the poor.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-session, culturally-sensitive, interactive stroke educational program compared to standard educational materials and usual care. In this study, the scientists will determine if the interactive program increases knowledge about stroke, and results in earlier arrival to the emergency room in the case of stroke.\n\nThe study will enroll 1400 individuals who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Participants will be randomized to receive usual medical care--which includes standard educational information on stroke, stroke warning signs and risk factors--or usual medical care plus a 2-session interactive stroke educational program. All participants will be administered pre and post (30 days and 1 year) intervention stroke knowledge/behavior surveys. In additional, participants will be contacted every 12 months to check health status and document new stroke events associated with emergency room arrival time.\n\nThe SWIFT study is part of the Specialized Program for Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS), which seeks to understand why certain people may be at increased risk for stroke. The goal of the study is to increase stroke knowledge, change behavior, and improve emergency room arrival times upon onset of stroke symptoms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","interactive educational program","acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1635,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"interactive educational program","interventionNames":["Behavioral: interactive educational program"]},{"label":"2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"usual medical care","interventionNames":["Behavioral: usual medical care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"interactive educational program","description":"2-session interactive stroke educational program","armGroupLabels":["1"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"usual medical care","description":"standard educational materials and usual care","armGroupLabels":["2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Surveillance methodologies will measure arrival times of acute strokes from stroke symptoms onset to ER among participants for the length of the study, as well as increase in stroke knowledge at one month and one year post stroke event.","timeFrame":"at one month and one year post stroke event"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosed with cerebral infarction/TIA hospitalized at New York Presbyterian Hospital (Milstein Hospital and Allen Pavilion)\n* 18 year-old and older at onset of the stroke\n* Self-identified as of White, Black or Hispanic race-ethnicity\n* Living in a household with a telephone\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients unable to give informed consent\n* Discharged to nursing home or requiring 24 hour care.\n* A Modified Rankin score \\> 4 at baseline\n* Severe aphasia or severe cognitive impairment limiting comprehension\n* Pre-stroke dementia history\n* Patients with end stage cancer, or other medical conditions resulting in mortality \\</= 1 year","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala, DrPH","affiliation":"Columbia University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Neurological Institute, 710 W 168th Street, 6th Floor, Room 640","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10032","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34813082","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Crocker TF, Brown L, Lam N, Wray F, Knapp P, Forster A.
