Two large non-randomized clinical trials (B_PROUD \\& BEST-MSU) have recently shown that MSU use leads to improved functional outcomes at 3 months in specific settings. However, MSUs have been criticized because of their cost and a lack of evidence of a significant reduction in the time between symptom onset and mechanical thrombectomy, which is the cornerstone of treatment of patients with large vessel occlusion.\n\nWe hypothesized that compared to usual care, the deployment of a MSU would result in an incremental cost-utility ratio ≤50,000 euros per QALY in the lifetime horizon, even in an area with many thrombectomy-capable centers..\n\nAcademic-driven open-label randomized controlled trial of Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU) deployment versus standard care in France, with blinded assessment of efficacy endpoints. Randomization will be performed on an individual patient basis (randomization of MSU deployment at dispatch). 450 patients with confirmed acute ischemic stroke (emergency call ≤6 hours after onset) will be recruited over a 3-year period, with 3-month follow-up. Costs and clinical outcomes will be collected prospectively during the study period and used to extrapolate the incremental cost-utility ratio over a lifetime horizon."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Mobile Stroke Unit","MSU","Intravenous thrombolysis","Emergency Medical Service","Mechanical thrombectomy","Cost-utility","Cost-effectiveness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial, PROBE design","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Blinded assessment of 3-month mRS (via telephone interview)","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":450,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention (MSU)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Deployment of MSU + conventional ambulance","interventionNames":["Other: Mobile Stroke Unit deployment"]},{"label":"Control (usual care)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Deployment of conventional ambulance"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mobile Stroke Unit deployment","description":"Deployment of an MSU + conventional ambulance, allowing prehospital CT-scan imaging with intracranial CT angiography.
