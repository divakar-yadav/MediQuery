Due to small and heterogenous study populations further trials are urgently needed. This prospective, randomized, clinical \\& experimental controlled noninvasive study is intended to provide data for the therapy of an individual approach in aphasia patients.","detailedDescription":"The prospective, randomized, clinical \\& experimental controlled noninvasive study (Lexi) is intended to start in 10/2019. Adult and German speaking patients suffering from aphasia after stroke who give informed consent and whose life expectancy is estimated above 1 year are included and will be followed up for 3 months. If informed consent is not available their legal guardian will have to provide written informed consent for their contribution.\n\nAfter Randomization participants are divided into two different groups:\n\nPatients receiving a standard logopedic speech treatment versus individuals working with a computer-based solution (Neolexon® App on mobile devices). Both groups will also have self-training and therefore frequency and intensity of this is also going to be analyzed as well as in the clinical surrounding.\n\nThere will be three different major ward rounds in both groups during the trial period where scales scoring the severity of aphasia are collected and compared (i.e. AABT or LAST).\n\nFurthermore epidemiologic data and stroke scales (i.e. NIHSS, mRS) are evaluated. The last round will be the follow-up after 3 months. Lexi will provide new data to fill the gap of organizational barriers and structural problems. Our aim is to show modern alternative therapy algorithms that approach the individual problem to offer a potential tailored solution to patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia, Acquired","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","Aphasia","Speech therapy","Computer based"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neolexon Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Neolexon","Other: Self training"]},{"label":"Standard logopedic therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Speech therapy","Other: Self training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Neolexon","description":"Application (Neolexon) on Tablet.
