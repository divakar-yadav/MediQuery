A recent meta-analysis reported the prevalence of depression and anxiety in stroke caregivers as 40.2% and 21.4% respectively.\n\nAn evidence profile report by the World Health Organization(WHO) has emphasised that psychological support is crucial in helping caregivers in the community to continue caring for individuals with long-term disabilities, such as stroke patients. Therefore, early psychological intervention (EPI) is crucial to improve the management and prognosis of an individual who are facing stressful events like caregiving.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to prevent or alleviate the significant psychological consequences in carers resulting from stroke events in family members. Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) is delivered as an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) to support the clients to engage in cognitive reframing and empower them with proper knowledge, skills and attitudes to make behavioural changes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Caregiver Burden","Mobile Phone Use"],"keywords":["Cognitive-behavioural therapy","ecological momentary intervention","early psychological intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":152,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receive iCBT-based EMI with message content, delivery frequency and timing personalised to participants' preferences.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: iCBT-based EMI"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Receive general mental health information through instant message."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"iCBT-based EMI","description":"Consists of brief iCBT for psychological support (mandatory), stroke care education (optional), and nurse-led real-time chat-based support messages, delivered according to participants' preferences.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9])","description":"A 9-item scale with score ranging from 0 to 27, higher scores indicate higher severity of depressive symptom","timeFrame":"24-week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7])","description":"A 7-item scale with score ranging from 0 to 21, higher scores indicate higher severity of anxiety symptoms","timeFrame":"24-week"},{"measure":"Stress level (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS-4])","description":"A 4-item scale with score ranging from 0 to 16, higher scores indicate higher severity of stress","timeFrame":"24-week"},{"measure":"Loneliness level (UCLA Loneliness Scale [ULS-8])","description":"The total score (8 items) ranges from 8 to 32 points, with higher scores suggesting a higher degree of loneliness","timeFrame":"24-week"},{"measure":"Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II)","description":"The total score (7 items) ranges from 7 to 49 points, with higher scores suggesting a higher degree of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance","timeFrame":"24-week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary family caregiver of first-ever stroke patient who has \\<15 modified Barthel Index(mBI) scores (moderate disability);\n* Caregiver of a stroke patient who has a hospital inpatient stay of ≥6 days and ≤21days;\n* Aged ≥18;\n* Able to read and communicate in Chinese (Cantonese or Putonghua);\n* Able to use mobile phone instant messaging function;
