Patients will maintain their usual inpatient rehabilitation including occupational therapy. At baseline (T0) and after 2weeks of enrollment (T1), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) will be assessed at each time. And patients with the changes of FMA between T0 and T1 less than 3 points will be finally recruited. The enrolled patients will receive additional 30-min cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the contralesional motor cortex for 10 consecutive weekdays, with maintaining their usual conventional rehabilitation. At T1 and immediately after 10-seessions of tDCS (T2) and 1 month after completing 10-tDCS session (T3), FMA, Actional Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT) and electroencephalography (EEG) were measured."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Motor Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the contralesional motor cortex","description":"Cathodal tDCS will be applied to the contralesional motor cortex with 2mA intesntisy for 30 mins/day.
