This system uses site independent software to access the camera system from multiple locations. The study will determine if video consultation is superior to telephone consultation for remote evaluation or treatment of stroke patients, and the usefulness of this system in evaluating patients with suspected stroke symptoms. However, this method is being used in other fields of medicine for assistance in medical evaluations.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive evaluation by either the video camera system or by telephone alone. For those assigned to the video camera system, the system will be activated and will record and transmit video and audio images to a stroke specialist located at a remote location. He/she may ask the participants questions relating to medical illnesses and current symptoms, and may also review laboratory tests and x-ray images using a computer, if available. The stroke specialist will also perform general physical and neurological examinations, which will take place by video camera with the assistance of a bedside physician who will perform the actual examinations.\n\nFor those participants assigned to the telephone-only consultation, the video system will not be activated, but the same procedure as above will be followed except the stroke specialist will not be able to see the participants or examine them using the video camera system. Participation in the study will last for the entire time the participants are in the hospital. Participants will be contacted by telephone by a study nurse 3 months post-stroke for a 10-minute interview regarding their current health. The total duration for individual participation is 3 months.\n\nThe study is part of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS), which allows researchers to enhance and initiate translational research that ultimately will benefit stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","digital video","SPOTRIAS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":234,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telemedicine","description":"Patients randomized to this group were evaluated using the digital observation camera and DICOM evaluations for telemedicine"},{"label":"Telephone","description":"Patients randomized to this group were evaluated using telephone only and no use of the digital observation camera or DICOM"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Appropriateness of Decision to Treat or Not Treat With Thrombolytics","description":"This primary measure assesses the appropriateness of decision to treat or not treat with thrombolytics for patients presenting potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset.\n\nAppropriateness was assessed using a centralized adjudicating committee, 3 levels of data availability, and an independent medical monitor assessment.
