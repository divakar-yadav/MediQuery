After stroke many patients are unable to engage in normal upper limb functional activities, which may restrict them from participation in meaningful life roles. For many, conventional rehabilitation does not restore upper limb function to a useful level. The purpose of this research is to investigate the benefits of three promising motor learning interventions: focused intensive, motor learning (FIML); 2) robotics and motor learning (ROB-ML); and 3) functional neuromuscular stimulation and motor learning (FNS-ML)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke","electric stimulation","robotics","motor learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Motor Learning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"subjects are provided with intensive motor learning training of the upper limb","interventionNames":["Other: Motor Learning"]},{"label":"Robotics and Motor Learning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"subject are provided with intensive motor learning and robotics training of the upper limb","interventionNames":["Other: Motor Learning","Other: Robotics"]},{"label":"Motor learning and FES","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"subjects are provided with intensive motor learning and surface FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) of the upper limb","interventionNames":["Other: Motor Learning","Other: surface FES"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor Learning","description":"training of the hemiplegic upper limb with motor learning","armGroupLabels":["Motor Learning","Motor learning and FES","Robotics and Motor Learning"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robotics","description":"subjects perform training of hemiplegic arm using an upper extremity robot","armGroupLabels":["Robotics and Motor Learning"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"surface FES","description":"subjects are provided with surface FES to the hemiplegic upper limb","armGroupLabels":["Motor learning and FES"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer","description":"impairment measure of coordination of the upper limb","timeFrame":"after 12 weeks of intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\>1 year post stroke no acute, uncontrolled medical condition single stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pacemaker other neurological condition more than one stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center","city":"Cleveland","state":"Ohio","zip":"44118","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.4995,"lon":-81.69541}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
