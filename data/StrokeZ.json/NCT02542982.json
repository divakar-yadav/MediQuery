Each group received intensive MT for 45 min/day, 5 days/week, for 2 weeks, which was preceded by 20 minutes of 2 milliampere of anodal tDCS over the ipsilesional M1 vs. sham tDCS.\n\nOutcome measures are tested at baseline (T0), and after the intervention Day 1 (T1), after stimulation protocol completion Day 10 (T2) and 30 days later (T3)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["tDCS","motor recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group of patients on active treatment will receive intensive motor training for 45 min/day, 5 days/week, for 2 weeks, which would be preceded by 20 minutes of 2 mA anodal tDCS over the ipsilesional motor cortex.","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS (Endomed 482;
