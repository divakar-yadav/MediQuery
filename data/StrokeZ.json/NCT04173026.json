Part 3 of the DISPLACE study is an implementation clinical trial designed to test novel implementation strategies with the goal of improving adherence and implementation of stroke screening. 16 of the lowest scoring implementation rates from DISPLACE Part 1 will participate in DISPLACE Part 3. All original 28 sites from DISPLACE Parts 1 and 2 will receive a patient and provider educational intervention including a re-branding of the TCD as \"Sickle Stroke Screen\" with a new infographic and educational materials. The 16 sites with moving to Part 3 will be provided a Provider reminder strategy, which is a web based application designed to remind providers of when patients are due for their Sickle Stroke Screen. These 16 sites will be randomized and 8 will be given an additional Patient Communication Strategy. These sites will have a single designed coordinator with whom patients will communicate with about scheduling, rescheduling, and any other questions regarding their Sickle Stroke Screen. Upon completion, data will be analyzed to compare those who have had TCD screenings done appropriately and those who did not as well as the overall effect of the multi level interventions on the changes in TCD rates."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized cluster controlled implementation study","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Provider intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"A web-based application called ProviderMinder has been developed and will be used to alert providers when a patient who has been lost-to-follow-up or has missed their Sickle Stroke Screen (TCD).
