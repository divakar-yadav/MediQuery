Major safety results include major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding.\n\nB. Major efficacy results include strokes, systemic embolism and mortality. C. Other results include myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, hospitalization, drug compliance, quality of life questionnaire (AFEQT), cognitive function (KDSQ), aging questionnaire(K-Frail) and hand grip strength."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation Patients With Intermediate Stroke Risk"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","anticoagulation","intermediate stroke risk","efficacy","safety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1800,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Apixaban 5mg twice daily (2.5mg twice daily if meets dose-reduction criteria) for 2 years","interventionNames":["Drug: Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)"]},{"label":"Nonanticoagulation group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard treatment except anticoagulant for 2 years"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)","description":"Apixaban 5mg twice daily (2.5mg twice daily if meets dose-reduction criteria) for 2 years","armGroupLabels":["Anticoagulation group(Apixaban group)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"Composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"Composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"Composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"Composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"Composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Composite outcome","description":"Composite outcome including stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke","description":")Ischemic stroke specifically refers to central nervous system infarction (brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia) accompanied by overt symptoms, while silent infarction by definition causes no known symptoms.
