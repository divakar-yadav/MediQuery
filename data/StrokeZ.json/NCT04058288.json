As upper-limb motor functions are crucial for most of the daily living activities, there is a need for effective intervention. The current therapeutic approaches involve intensive physical therapy training involving repetitive tasks which causes fatigue and lack of engagement in the patients. To address this issue, the investigators will investigate the combined use of individually targeted noninvasive brain stimulation (T-NIBS) using High-definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) and music-assisted hand exercises using MusicGlove to modulate the neuroplasticity in the desired manner to observe functional changes in hand dexterity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","HD-tDCS","musicglove","Upper-limb rehab"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"People suffering from upper-limb motor dysfunction due to stroke","interventionNames":["Device: High-definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High-definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","description":"Stimulation sessions will be conducted on 2 different visits separated by 2-week gap. In a crossover design, Anodal HD-tDCS will be delivered either in Active/Sham mode (during the first visit) and Sham/Active during the second visit in a 4x1 ring configuration (center electrode being Anode and the surrounding 4 electrodes being cathodes) over the affected motor area.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) scores","description":"NHPT is a secondary outcome measure of finger dexterity that can be used in stroke patients with upper extremity motor deficits. It is considered to be a reliable measure of hand dexterity and recommended for inclusion in NIH toolbox Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function. NHPT requires participants to repeatedly place nine pegs into nine holes, one at a time, as quickly as possible and then remove them from the holes. The total time needed to complete the task is then recorded.","timeFrame":"baseline (at day 1), during testing visits (day 2 and day 3)- all within 2 weeks from the screening and consenting"},{"measure":"Changes in the Dexterity and Speed Test (DAST) scores","description":"DAST is exclusively developed for MusicGlove performance assessment and it is designed to evaluate how fast and accurately do the subjects respond to the sequence of music notes that continuously sped up.","timeFrame":"baseline (at day 1), during testing visits (day 2 and day 3)- all within 2 weeks from the screening and consenting"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in the Cortical Excitability using Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP)","description":"MEP outcome measures have become the norm in brain stimulation studies.
