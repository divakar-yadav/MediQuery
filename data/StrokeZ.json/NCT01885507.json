Moreover, a systematic approach to extubation may decrease the rate of extubation failure and enhance outcomes of brain-injured patients.\n\nWe hypothesized that medical education and implementation of an evidence-base care bundle associating protective ventilation and systemic approach to extubation can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in brain-injured patients.","detailedDescription":"A before/after study design will be used. The before period (control phase) will consisted of all consecutive patients with severe brain-injury who were admitted to the participating ICUs.\n\nDuring the interphase, all physicians, residents, physiotherapists and nurses will receive a formal training for the processes and procedures related to the 2 point bundle: protective ventilation and systematic approach to extubation (according to recommendation for the use of tidal volume \\< 7 ml/kg and of a positive expiratory pressure = 6 to 8 cmH20 (centimeter of water) and extubation as soon as ventilatory weaning is associated with a glasgow coma scale equal or above 10 and cought).\n\nThe after period consisted of all consecutive severe brain-injured patients admitted to the participating ICUs after the formal
