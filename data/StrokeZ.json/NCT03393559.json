The primary outcome is the incidence of intraoperative hypotension (mean blood pressure \\< 60mmHg or systolic blood pressure \\< 80% of baseline). Secondary outcomes are the incidence of intraoperative cerebral desaturation (cerebral oxygen saturation \\< 80% of baseline, longer than 30 seconds), total amounts of administered inotropic agents, and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cerebral oxygen saturation at various time points."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intraoperative Hypotension","Cerebral Ischemia","Shoulder Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group L","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"leg elevation during the beach chair position","interventionNames":["Procedure: leg elevation"]},{"label":"Group C","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients' leg will be straightened without any intervention."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"leg elevation","description":"Patients' leg will be raised by a pillow under both legs and the hip and knee joints will be flexed 45 degrees to position both knees at the heart level.","armGroupLabels":["Group L"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of intraoperative hypotension","description":"Mean blood pressure \\< 60 mmHg or systolic blood pressure \\< 80% of baseline","timeFrame":"From beach chair positioning to the end of surgery (average of 1 hour up to 2 hours)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of intraoperative cerebral desaturation","description":"Cerebral oxygen saturation \\< 80% of baseline longer than 30 seconds","timeFrame":"From beach chair positioning to the end of surgery (average of 1 hour up to 2 hours)"},{"measure":"Total amounts of administered inotropic agents","description":"Total amounts of administered inotropic agents after the Beach-chair positioning","timeFrame":"From beach chair positioning to the end of surgery (average of 1 hour up to 2 hours)"},{"measure":"Systolic blood pressure","description":"Systolic blood pressure in mmHg at multiple time-points","timeFrame":"before induction(baseline) / before the Beach-chair positioning / 1,5,30 and 60 minutes after the Beach-chair positioning"},{"measure":"Heart rate","description":"Heart rate in bpm at multiple time-points","timeFrame":"before induction(baseline) / before the Beach-chair positioning / 1,5,30 and 60 minutes after the Beach-chair positioning"},{"measure":"Peripheral oxygen saturation","description":"Peripheral oxygen saturation in percentage at multiple time-points","timeFrame":"before induction(baseline) / before the Beach-chair positioning / 1,5,30 and 60 minutes after the Beach-chair positioning"},{"measure":"Cerebral oxygen saturation","description":"Cerebral oxygen saturation in percentage at multiple time-points","timeFrame":"before induction(baseline) / before the Beach-chair positioning / 1,5,30 and 60 minutes after the Beach-chair positioning"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* adult patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the beach chair position\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with myocardial infarction\n* Patients with pacemaker\n* Patients with cerebrovascular disease\n* patients with arteriovenous fistula at the opposite arm\n* Patients with autonomic nerve disorders\n* Patients with hip or knee joint disorder limiting hip or knee flexion\n* BMI \\> 30 kg/m2","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jin-Tae Kim, PhD","affiliation":"Seoul National University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Seoul National University Hospital","city":"Seoul","zip":"110-744","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL","SAP","ICF","CSR"],"timeFrame":"IPD will be made available after article publication, for 3 years from the study completion.","accessCriteria":"Proposals should be directed to the corresponding author and will be reviewed by the study group.
