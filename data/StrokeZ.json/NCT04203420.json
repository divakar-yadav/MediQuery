But the prevalence of PA in young adults with stroke onset before 45 years old had never been investigated. The study aimed to discover the prevalence as well as the clinical characteristics between patients with PA and those without PA during stroke attack. In order to fulfill this objective, investigators intended to conduct a cross-sectional study by taking screening and confirmatory tests among young adults who once admitted due to early onset of acute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Primary Aldosteronism"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":116,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients with PA","description":"patients who finally been diagnosed with primary aldosteronism","interventionNames":["Other: screening and confirmatory tests"]},{"label":"patients without PA","description":"patients who finally been diagnosed without primary aldosteronism","interventionNames":["Other: screening and confirmatory tests"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"screening and confirmatory tests","description":"screening test is a blood test of the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration(PAC) and direct renin concentration(DRC), confirmatory test is Captopril Challenge test","armGroupLabels":["patients with PA","patients without PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"prevalence of PA","description":"to find out the proportion of PA patients in young adults with early onset of acute stroke","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- patients who were once admitted in the First affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical university(CQMU), with stroke onset less than two weeks\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\ndeath, serious sequela with motor, comprehensive or linguistic dysfunction, patients unwilling to join in, etiology of trauma, infective or tumor disease, patients with impaired cardiac, renal or liver function during admission-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients who were once admitted in the First affiliated hospital of CQMU during Jan.2006 to Feb.2019 with stroke onset less than two weeks.
