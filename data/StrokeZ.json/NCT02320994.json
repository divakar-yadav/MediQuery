The investigators believe this aftercare could be better coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres. In this study the investigators postulate that a similar coordinated approach to care can be extended to the phase after in-patient rehabilitation has ended (i.e. \"long-term management\" as opposed to \"early supported discharge\") for disabled patients with stroke living in the community."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","aftercare"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients","description":"post-rehabilitation stroke patients"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of unmet Needs","description":"Unmet needs of patients and carers after discharge from Rehabilitation.
