Prof Dr. Qi Li will be the senior consultant for the study. The study will be focusing on natural history, epidemiological , radiological, rehabilitative and clinical aspects as well as the effect of various treatments on the hemorrhagic patients.\n\nThe study related data of the patients diagnosed with intracerebral hemorrhage will be collected in prospective and retrospective ways. The prognostic data for the patients will be assembled and collected via using different outcome measures at different points of time.","detailedDescription":"The study will be used to address the several key issues related to intracerebral hemorrhage. The demographics, scores based upon disease severity , mRS, GCS, NIHSS scores will be recorded at baseline and in the prospective and retrospective ways. The data obtained from the registered patients will be used for future use , critical review by expert neurologists, neurorehabilitative experts for further use and review."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral
