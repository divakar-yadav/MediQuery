Minor ischemic events, including minor stroke and TIA, were major parts of stroke manifestations. Events (CHANCE) has shown that 21-day dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) compared to aspirin alone which initiated within 24 hours after symptoms onset would reduce 32% risk of stroke recurrence within 90 day, but not in carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles. The primary purpose of this study is to compare ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin on reducing the 3-month risk of any stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic, primary outcome) when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in CYP2Y19 LOF alleles carriers with TIA or minor stroke.\n\nBoth intent analysis (ITT) and compliance program set (PPS) were used for analysis.\n\nWe will use Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) event during maximum 90-day follow-up, with hazards ratios and 95% CI calculated using Cox proportional hazards methods and the log-rank test to evaluate the treatment effect. All statistics will be 2-sided with P\\<0.05 considered significant, accounting for interim analyses.\n\nAll patients who received study drugs and with at least one safety follow-up record will be included in the safety population. The data for safety evaluation included adverse reactions observed during the trial and changes in laboratory data before and after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["stroke","transient ischemic attack","acute treatment","acute non-disabling cerebrovascular event","clopidogrel","ticagrelor","clopidogrel combined with ASA","ticagrelor combined with ASA","recurrence of stroke and other vascular events","CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele(s) carrier"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6412,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ticagrelor plus Aspirin Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ticagrelor of loading dosing of 180mg followed by 90mg bid for 3 months plus aspirin of loading dose of 75-300mg followed by 75mg daily for 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Ticagrelor and Aspirin"]},{"label":"Clopidogrel plus Aspirin Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Clopidogrel of loading dosing of 300mg followed by 75mg daily for 3 months plus aspirin loading dose of 75-300mg followed by 75mg daily for 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Clopidogrel and Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ticagrelor and Aspirin","description":"Day of randomization:\n\nDay1:Ticagrelor 180mg; placebo of clopidogrel 300mg; aspirin 75-300mg (open label) Day2-21st: Ticagrelor 90mg bid/day; placebo of clopidogrel 75mg; aspirin 75mg (open label) Day 22nd-3 months:Ticagrelor 90mg bid/day; placebo of clopidogrel 75mg","armGroupLabels":["Ticagrelor plus Aspirin Group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Clopidogrel and Aspirin","description":"Day of randomization:\n\nDay 1: Clopidogrel 300mg; placebo of ticagrelor 180mg; aspirin 75-300mg (open label) Day2-21st: Clopidogrel 75mg/day; placebo of ticagrelor 90mg bid/day; aspirin 75mg (open label) Day 22nd-3 months:Clopidogrel 75mg; placebo of ticagrelor 90mg bid/day","armGroupLabels":["Clopidogrel plus Aspirin Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Any new stroke events (ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke) within 3 months","description":"The aim is to assess the effects of ticagrelor plus aspirin versus clopidogrel plus aspirin on reducing the 3-month risk of any stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic, primary outcome) when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in CYP2Y19 LOF alleles carriers with TIA or minor stroke.","timeFrame":"3 months after randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Any new stroke events within 30 days and 1 year","description":"Percentage of patients with the 30 days and 1 year new stroke events (ischemic stroke/ hemorrhagic stroke) as a cluster and evaluated individually.","timeFrame":"30 days and 1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"New clinical vascular events including stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and vascular deaths within 3 months and 1 year","description":"Percentage of patients with the 3 months and 1 year new clinical vascular events (ischemic stroke/ hemorrhagic stroke/ TIA/ myocardial infarction/vascular death)","timeFrame":"3 months and 1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"New ischemic stroke within 3 months and 1 year","description":"Percentage of patients with the 3 months and 1 year new ischemic stroke will be evaluated.","timeFrame":"3 months and 1 year after randomization"},{"measure":"Disabling stroke (Modified Rankin Scale score, mRS>1) at 3 months and 1 year","description":"Modified Rankin Scale, a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. 0 - No symptoms.1 - No significant disability.
