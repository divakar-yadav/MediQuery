The trial will use a non-inferiority gatekeeper approach to test for non-inferiority of early anticoagulation followed by a test for superiority, if non-inferiority is established.","detailedDescription":"Current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on the timing of OAC after acute AF-related stroke. Current United Kingdom (UK) guidelines for anticoagulation state that \"delay for an arbitrary 2-week period is recommended\" for \"disabling\" stroke and that anticoagulation can be started \"no later than 14 days\" for other strokes, at the prescriber's discretion.\n\nOPTIMAS will investigate whether early initiation of DOAC treatment, within 4 days (96hrs) of onset, in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and AF is as effective as, or better than, standard initiation of DOAC treatment, no sooner than day 7 (\\>144hrs) and no later than day 14 (\\<336hrs) after onset, in preventing recurrent ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH)?
