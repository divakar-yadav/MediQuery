The objectives of this study are:\n\n1. To compare the differences between results of hand kinematic computational analysis in patients with ischemic stroke and healthy subjects.\n2. To analyze the relation between hand kinematic computational analysis and clinical scales usually performed to evalutate neurologic deficits in stroke patients.\n3. To analyze the relation between hand kinematic computational analysis and stroke lesion on brain MRI.\n4. To analyze changes between results of hand kinematic computational analysis in the acute phase of stroke and at three months, and its relation with evolution of neurological evaluation clinical scales, functional clinical scales and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke patients with functional deficit of the hand","interventionNames":["Device: Kinematic computational analysis of the hand (Leap Motion device)"]},{"label":"Healthy subjects","interventionNames":["Device: Kinematic computational analysis of the hand (Leap Motion device)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Kinematic computational analysis of the hand (Leap Motion device)","description":"Kinematic computational analysis exercises:\n\n1.
