Among these sequelae, fatigue is frequently reported by patients. It is therefore important for doctors to understand why patients suffer from fatigue after cerebral infarction and to determine whether treatments given for the cerebral infarction may have an impact on this fatigue.\n\nThe aim of this research was to study the frequency of fatigue after cerebral infarction, the associated factors, in particular the impact of treatments administered in the acute phase."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Symptomatic Cerebral
