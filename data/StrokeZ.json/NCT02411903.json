Currently, study on moderate doses of statins and dynamic Clopidogrel resistance has not been reported, therefore this study will observe 160 cases of open prospective secondary prevention in patients with cerebral infarction. Excluded: those patients occurs Clopidogrel resistance because of slow metabolism caused by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19（CYP2C19, and then observed the impact of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）-metabolized and non-cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）-metabolized statins dynamically on Clopidogrel resistance in the next 9 months, adverse events will be recorded, the metabolite of clopidogrel（H4 ）and the polymorphism of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19 （CYP2C19）/cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）/ cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9（CYP2C9）will be detected. Expected Result: the patients use the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4（CYP3A4）-metabolized statins will result in dynamic Clopidogrel resistance easily ,H4 levels will decline, and Clopidogrel resistance is not related to the polymorphism of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction","Clopidogrel,Poor Metabolism of (Disorder)"],"keywords":["Clopidogrel-drug interactions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"atorvastatin and Clopidogrel","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"80 patients will be taking atorvastatin 40mg/d plus clopidogrel 75mg/d for 9 months。","interventionNames":["Drug: atorvastatin and clopidogrel"]},{"label":"rosuvastatin and Clopidogrel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"80 patients will be taking rosuvastatin 20mg/d plus clopidogrel 75mg/d for 9 months。","interventionNames":["Drug: rosuvastatin and clopidogrel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"atorvastatin and clopidogrel","description":"Dose: atorvastatin 40mg/d plus clopidogrel 75mg/d for 9 months.","armGroupLabels":["atorvastatin and Clopidogrel"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"rosuvastatin and clopidogrel","description":"Dose: rosuvastatin 20mg/d plus clopidogrel 75mg/d for 9 months.","armGroupLabels":["rosuvastatin and Clopidogrel"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"incidence of clopidogrel resistance","description":"Definition of clopidogrel resistance is the absolute change of 5 microliter adenosine diphosphate(ADP) induced PAR≤10% as compared to baseline.
