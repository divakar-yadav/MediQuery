Our recent study imply that the neuroprotective effect of DELP involved multiple neuroprotective mechanism such as anti-inflammation, free radical scavenging, and decreasing MMP-9. Based on the multiple mechanisms, we argue that DELP may exert neuroprotective effect on acute cerebral hemorrhage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral
