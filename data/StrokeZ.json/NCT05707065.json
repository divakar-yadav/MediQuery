Good trunk stability is essential for balance and extremity use during daily functional activities and higher-level tasks. The anticipatory activity of trunk muscles is impaired in stroke patients. The trunk is the central column of the body; therefore, proximal trunk control is a prerequisite for distal limb movement control, balance, and functional activities. The purpose of the study is to highlight the most appropriate rehabilitation technique for trunk stability.","detailedDescription":"A randomized clinical trial will be performed in which 42 patients with strokes will be included. The data will be collected from Riphah Rehabilitation center Lahore and Ittefaq hospital Lahore. Consecutive sampling technique will be used to collect data. The duration of the study will be 10 months. Trunk impairment scale and berg balance scale will be used as the data collection tool. Data collection will be started after taking informed consent from all the patients. Patients will be allocated to intervention groups by randomization. The patients in group A will be given core strengthening exercise for 4 weeks. The patient in group B will be given PNF exercise for the treatment of trunk for 4 weeks. After data collection analysis of pre and post values will be done by using SPSS version 25."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation; Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"core strengthening exercises","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be positioned in supine.\n\n* first stage participants will be taught to activate abdominal wall musculature.
