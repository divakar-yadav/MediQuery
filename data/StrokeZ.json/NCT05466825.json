If and to what extent regional differences in risk factor levels contribute to new-onset CVD remains to be elucidated.\n\nIn the Global Cardiovascular Risk Consortium (GCVRC) we focus on five major cardiovascular risk factors: Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, current smoking, and diabetes. We aim to show the extent to which the distribution, population attributable risk, and predictive value of these factors differ geographically and by sex. Understanding of these issues is essential to guide regionally effective CVD prevention and therapy strategies, to determine residual risk, and to improve global cardiovascular health.\n\nThe GCVRC uses individual-level harmonized data from nearly 1.7 million individuals in 126 cohorts across 43 countries, categorized in 8 geographical regions (based on amodification of WHO regions) - North America, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and Middle East, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, Asia, Oceania.\n\nCox regression analyses and population attributable fractions (PAFs) for 10-year incident CVD are calculated for the five risk factors by geographical region and sex to determine the percentage of CVD burden that may be preventable by control of these risk factors.\n\nThe results will influence regionally adapted prevention strategies to reduce the global CVD burden."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Coronary Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Angina, Unstable","Stroke","Myocardial Revascularization"],"keywords":["cardiovascular disease","cardiovascular risk factors","risk factor modification","global","population-attributable fraction","geographical comparison","myocardial infarction","coronary heart disease","stroke","heart disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1596155,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD)","description":"Non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease death, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac revascularization, unclassifiable death, fatal and non-fatal stroke (any type).
