Our pre-clinical studies confirmed that ischemic preconditioning can prevent cerebral infarction. Animal studies confirmed that ischemic postconditioning can reduce infarct size of cerebral infarction. Investigators hypothesized that postconditioning would reduce infarct volume of ischemic stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study explored the neuroprotective effects of post-positioning on ischemic stroke patients with randomized, double-blinded and controlled method. Patients are divided into experimental and placebo groups to receive remote ischemic post-conditioning for 30 days. Remote ischemic post-conditioning is performed by the inflating tourniquets to certain extents on bilateral arms with 5 cycles of 5min inflation and 5min relax alternation for the total of 30 consecutive days. It is 200mmHg for RIPC group and 60mmHg for control group. Evaluation parameters include CRP, TNF-α, ICAM-1 and GFAP in blood at 0, 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after treatment; and MRI at 0 and 30 days after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIPC group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RIPC treatment was performed by the inflating tourniquets to 200mmHg on bilateral arms with 5 cycles of 5min inflation and 5min relax alternation for the total of 30 consecutive days.","interventionNames":["Device: RIPC group"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"RIPC sham was performed by the inflating tourniquets to 60mmHg on bilateral arms with 5 cycles of 5min inflation and 5min relax alternation for the total of 30 consecutive days.","interventionNames":["Device: Control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RIPC group","armGroupLabels":["RIPC group"],"otherNames":["Brand name: Doctormate","Type: IPC-906X","Productor: Beijing Renqiao Institute of Neuroscience"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Control group","armGroupLabels":["Control group"],"otherNames":["Brand name: Doctormate","Type: modified version of IPC-906X","Productor: Beijing Renqiao Institute of Neuroscience"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Local tissue damage 30 days after RIPC treatment","description":"Evaluated by the doctor blinded to the study protocol, including: local edema, redness, skin breakage","timeFrame":"30 days after RIPC treatment"},{"measure":"Levels of plasma biomarkers assay right before RIPC treatment","description":"levels of CRP、TINF-α、slCAM-1 and GFAP","timeFrame":"right before RIPC treatment (within 24hrs)"},{"measure":"Levels of plasma biomarkers assay 3 days after RIPC treatment.","description":"levels of CRP、TINF-α、slCAM-1 and GFAP","timeFrame":"3 days after RIPC treatment."},{"measure":"Levels of plasma biomarkers assay 15 days after RIPC treatment.","description":"levels of CRP、TINF-α、slCAM-1 and GFAP","timeFrame":"15 days after RIPC treatment."},{"measure":"Levels of plasma biomarkers assay 30 days after RIPC treatment","description":"levels of CRP、TINF-α、slCAM-1 and GFAP","timeFrame":"30 days after RIPC treatment"},{"measure":"Levels of plasma biomarkers assay right after RIPC treatment","description":"levels of CRP、TINF-α、slCAM-1 and GFAP","timeFrame":"right after RIPC treatment (within 24hrs)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Infarct volume evaluation before RIPC treatment.","description":"MRI evaluation of infarct volume in ischemic stroke patients before RIPC treatment.","timeFrame":"Acute phase of ischemic stroke, and before RIPC treatment"},{"measure":"Infarct volume after RIPC treatment in ischemic stroke patients","description":"Infarct volume evaluation in ischemic stroke patients after 30 RIPC treatment","timeFrame":"30 days after RIPC treatment in ischemic stroke patients"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. age between 40 to 80 Years\n2.
