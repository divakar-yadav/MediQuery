In the study, investigators will enroll 2500 subjects who serve in military units in Thesally Greece. Firstly investigators will estimate the prevalence of thallasaemia trait in this population , as it is very high in this region and at the same time investigators will retrospectively record data from their personal files (which are annually recorded)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Beta-Thalassemia Trait","Coronary Artery Disease"],"keywords":["Thalassemia","trait","coronary","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GrThalasaemia","description":"estimation of IMT of the carotides arteries and calcium scoring"},{"label":"GrNormal","description":"estimation of IMT of the carotides arteries and calcium scoring"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardioprotective role of Thalassemia Treat","description":"Cardioprotective role of Thalassemia Treat","timeFrame":"1 YEAR"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. voluntary participation,\n2.
