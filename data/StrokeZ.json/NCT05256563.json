Their self-care, mobility, and ability to return home are severely limited.","detailedDescription":"Spatial Neglect (SN)is an underdiagnosed stroke-related condition--and a specific core set of symptoms--Aiming Spatial Neglect-- may have a major adverse effect on outcome. These same symptoms may predict excellent response to spatial neglect therapy. The investigators seek to develop a biological parameter for treatment assignment. In this two-year study, the investigators will enroll 45 people with right brain stroke who are at high risk of SN. The investigators will examine clinical brain images, behavioral assessment and research brain images at baseline and recovery at 3 and 6 months after study entry."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spatial Neglect","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Right brain stroke survivors","description":"People with right brain stroke who are recruited to the study."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in functional ability for daily life tasks assessed on the FONE-FIM at 3 months","description":"Functional performance of daily life tasks will be assessed with the FONE-FIM questionnaire.
