This study is attended by 40 of the 58 Primary Stroke Centers in Kanagawa Prefecture, which is located in the Tokyo metropolitan area and has a population of 9.24 million. Patient enrollment for this study began in January 2018.","detailedDescription":"Inclusion criteria for this study are all consecutive patients who meet either or both of the patients who received intravenous tPA therapy for acute ischemic stroke and intention to perform EVT for large vessel occlusion. There were no exclusion criteria. The local neurologists, neurosurgeons, and neurointerventionalists at each institution made the decision to perform EVT and intravenous tPA.\n\nThe primary outcome was good as defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 2 at three months. We also determined a favorable outcome: mRS 0-2 or not worsening of the mRS score at three months. Secondary analyses included predicting a favorable outcome using multivariate logistic regression analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute stroke, mechanical thrombectomy, intravenous tPA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"4 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale","description":"The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 to 6.
