The 17,000 veterans who suffer a stroke yearly are at great risk for a second stroke and therefore should be targeted for stroke risk factor management and prevention interventions.\n\nBalance and fear of falling negatively impact activity and function. Decreased activity and blood pressure (BP) are important modifiable stroke risk factors. These can be addressed through a yoga exercise intervention. yoga, like tai-chi, is old world alternative medicine that has the potential to greatly impact the lives of older adults.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Our long term goal is to develop and test a yoga exercise intervention in a large VA trial for veterans who have survived a stroke. The objective of this pilot application was to obtain necessary information to support such a trial through the following specific aims: 1) determine the feasibility (including recruitment) of an 8 week yoga based intervention for veterans with stroke; 2) establish an appropriate dosing strategy for a post-stroke 8 week yoga exercise intervention for a future VA yoga implementation trial (Yoga Group, bi-weekly in-person vs Yoga Group Plus, bi-weekly in-person paired with almost daily at home yoga); and 3) estimate the effect size of yoga on variables of interest to determine the appropriate VA trial sample size.\n\nMETHODS: We completed a mixed methods study to address the feasibility, dosing strategy, and estimation of effect size for the current pilot study. We recruited 45 people with stroke to participate in the Yoga Group or Yoga Group Plus; 15 participants were wait-listed to be used as a control. A registered yoga therapist (RYT) taught all classes. Qualitative data include semi-structured interviews after completion of the intervention regarding: perceived ability to do yoga exercise; satisfaction with the yoga intervention; satisfaction with the RYT; general health benefits for the intervention; and whether they would continue yoga practice. Quantitative data included compliance and recruitment information as well as multiple standardized assessments before and after the 8 week intervention including: blood pressure readings; fear of falling; balance; balance confidence; gait and mobility assessments; and quality of life. We compared those in yoga to those wait-listed and also completed within group analyses to determine change between baseline and 8 week scores."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","accidental falls","Yoga","Blood pressure","Range of Motion","Rehabilitation","Exercise","balance","quality of life","mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":47,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1: Yoga Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Yoga Group, 8 week bi-weekly in-person yoga training focused on strength, flexibility, and balance\n\nYoga focused on strength, flexibility, and balance","interventionNames":["Other: Yoga focused on strength, flexibility, and balance"]},{"label":"Arm 2: Yoga Group Plus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Yoga Group Plus: 8 week, bi-weekly in-person yoga training focused on strength, flexibility, and balance paired with almost daily at home yoga focused on breathing and relaxation.\n\nYoga focused on strength, flexibility, and balance\n\nData for both yoga groups were combined for analyses as there were not any differences between these two groups.","interventionNames":["Other: Yoga focused on strength, flexibility, and balance"]},{"label":"Arm 3: Wait list control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"wait-list control: will be assessed before and after 8 weeks.
