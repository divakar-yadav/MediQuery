High-intensity signal in the plaque on the TOF-MRA is associated to a high risk of cerebral embolism during stenting. The evidence of protection selection in such patients was limited. A multicenter, prospective, outcome-assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial study (MOSCASH) is designed to compare the efficiency of distal and proximal embolism protection devices during CAS procedure of patients with high-intensity signal in the plaque on the TOF-MRA. Asymptomatic patients with internal carotid artery stenosis ≥ 70% (NASCET) and symptomatic patients with a stenosis ≥ 50% who have a high-intensity signal in the relevant plaques on TOF-MRA will be included. Patients are randomized in two balanced groups (1:1) to receive CAS with either distal (Spider FX) or proximal (Mo.Ma Ultra) protection. The primary endpoint is the incidence of new cerebral ipsilateral ischemic lesions on the Diffusion Weighted Imaging(DWI) in 7-days post operation. Secondary endpoints include the number, size, location of new cerebral ischemic lesions on the DWI, procedural complications, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death in 7 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Carotid Stenosis"],"keywords":["carotid stenting","embolism protection","Carotid Stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CAS with proximal protection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"using proximal embolism protection device during CAS","interventionNames":["Device: proximal embolism protection device"]},{"label":"CAS with distal protection","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"using distal protection device during CAS","interventionNames":["Device: distal embolism protection device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"proximal embolism protection device","description":"a proximal occlusion Mo.Ma will be used as the embolism protection device during CAS","armGroupLabels":["CAS with proximal protection"],"otherNames":["Mo.Ma Ultra (Invatec/Medtronic Vascular Inc, Santa Rosa, California)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"distal embolism protection device","description":"a distal SpiderFX will be used as the embolism protection device during CAS","armGroupLabels":["CAS with distal protection"],"otherNames":["SpiderFX (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ipsilateral new ischemic lesions on DWI","description":"the incidence of ipsilateral new ischemic lesions on DWI after CAS","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"major stroke","description":"the incidence of major stroke after CAS, defined as new onset of neurological symptoms causing an increase of NIHSS ≥ 4 or worsening of existing focal neurological deficit lasting ≥ 24 hours","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"myocardial infarction","description":"the incidence of myocardial infarction after CAS, defined as new onset of chest discomfort or cardiac stroke or heart failure with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers and ECG abnormalities","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"death","description":"In-hospital mortality","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"Other procedure-related complications","description":"including major/minor hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, etc.","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"},{"measure":"The number, size, and location of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","description":"The number, size, and location of new cerebral ischemic lesions on DW-MRI","timeFrame":"within 7 days post-operation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
