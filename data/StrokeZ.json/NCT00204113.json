We aim to achieve postural stability by combining controlled FES of the lower-limb muscles with the voluntary motor control skills of the intact upper body.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn spinal cord injury (SCI), the paralysed muscles generally retain their ability to contract and electrical stimulation can be used in rehabilitation as a therapy. With functional electrical stimulation (FES) the aim is to restore some normal motor functions such as standing, stepping or cycling. A number of studies have investigated the physiological effects and potential therapeutic benefits of lower-limb FES exercise. These studies have shown that the benefits include restoration of muscle bulk and strength, a reduction in the rate of bone demineralisation, improvements in the range of joint motion, and relaxation of spasm. Standing is an important part of rehabilitation therapy for paraplegic patients, and helps to alleviate some of the secondary effects of paralysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["spinal cord injury","standing","balance","functional electrical stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Multi-purpose rehabilitation frame"},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Surface Functional Electrical Stimulation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"estimates of physical parameters (ie. stiffness, viscosity, inertia)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"quality of standing"},{"measure":"amount of sway"},{"measure":"timing of standing"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neurologically intact, healthy individuals individuals with complete spinal cord lesion between T6 and T12\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Incomplete SCI","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Kenneth J Hunt, BSc, PhD, DSc","affiliation":"University of Glasgow","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Glasgow","city":"Glasgow","state":"Lanarkshire","zip":"G12 8QQ","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":55.86515,"lon":-4.25763}},{"facility":"Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit","city":"Glasgow","state":"Lanarkshire","zip":"G51 4TF","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":55.86515,"lon":-4.25763}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000013119","term":"Spinal Cord Injuries"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000013118","term":"Spinal Cord Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000020196","term":"Trauma, Nervous System"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15606","name":"Spinal Cord Injuries","asFound":"Spinal Cord Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15605","name":"Spinal Cord Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21713","name":"Trauma, Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"}]}},"hasResults":false}
