Resistant systemic arterial hypertension (RSAH) has an increased risk of end organ damage and unfavourable prognosis, whereas pseudo-RSAH usually respond favourably to drug therapy.\n\nTo prospectively investigate, in subjects with RSAH in a tropical South American city: 1) Adverse cardiovascular events defined as fatal and non-fatal stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI); and 2) the association of RAAS polymorphisms and adverse cardiovascular events in this population.\n\nStudy population: 212 hypertensives recruited from primary care assistance (time since first diagnosis of hypertension: 16.5±8.1 years) and without appropriate pressure control, between 2001 and 2006, corresponding to 0.48% of all hypertensives under care (18 new cases/year), 57±10 years old, 66% females. Under drug treatment schedule: three or more drugs including a diuretic. Ninety two randomly selected hypertensives basis had renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system genetic profile determined. Genetic assessment was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction assay amplification technique. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed: renin (G1051A), angiotensinogen (M235T), angiotensin converting enzyme-ACE (I/D), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (A1166C), aldosterone synthase (C344T) and mineralocorticoid receptor (G3514C)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Systemic Arterial Hypertension","Hypertension Resistant to Conventional Therapy","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke"],"keywords":["Systemic arterial hypertension","Hypertension Resistant to Conventional Therapy","Genetic polymorphisms","Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system genetic polymorphism","Risk markers","Adverse events","Acute myocardial infarction","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":92,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Resistant Arterial Hypertension","description":"Subjects with systemic arterial hypertension in whom arterial pressure control was not achieved (24hr ambulatory pressure monitoring: mean 24hr systolic pressure \\>/=130 mmHg or mean 24hr diastolic pressure \\>/=80mmHg) by non-investigation specialized hypertensive unit care, in spite of appropriate drug treatment regimen with three or more anti-hypertensive drugs including a diuretic.

In a following step, they were summed up for each subject, thus, creating a polygenic risk score.\n\nThe weights of the polymorphisms were, thus, defined:\n\n1. Angiotensinogen: MM - zero, MT - one, TT - two\n2. Renin: AA - zero, GA - one, GG - two\n3. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor: CC - zero, AC - one, AA - two\n4. Aldosterone synthase: CC - zero, TC - one, TT - two\n\nThe polygenic risk score value ranges from zero (all low risk polymorphisms in homozygosis) to eight (all high risk polymorphisms in homozygosis).","populationDescription":"Subjects in both resistant systemic arterial hypertension and pseudo-resistant systemic arterial hypertension groups had their respective genetic background scored according to present rule.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"NUMBER","unitOfMeasure":"composite enpoint events","timeFrame":"up to 10 years","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Polygenic Score: Zero","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to zero."},{"id":"OG001","title":"Polygenic Score: One","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to one."},{"id":"OG002","title":"Polygenic Score: Two","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to two."},{"id":"OG003","title":"Polygenic Score: Three","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to three."},{"id":"OG004","title":"Polygenic Score: Four","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to four."},{"id":"OG005","title":"Polygenic Score: Five","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to five."},{"id":"OG006","title":"Polygenic Score: Six","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to six."},{"id":"OG007","title":"Polygenic Score: Seven","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to seven."},{"id":"OG008","title":"Polygenic Score: Eight","description":"Sum of the weights for analyzing polymorphisms equal to eight."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"14"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"28"},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"21"},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"14"},{"groupId":"OG007","value":"5"},{"groupId":"OG008","value":"2"}]}],"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"3"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"17"},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"10"},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"8"},{"groupId":"OG007","value":"3"},{"groupId":"OG008","value":"2"}]}]}],"analyses":[{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001","OG002","OG003","OG004","OG005","OG006","OG007","OG008"],"groupDescription":"Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the polygenic score as predictor of composite endpoint (stroke + myocardial infarction)","testedNonInferiority":false,"nonInferiorityType":"SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER","pValue":"<0.01","pValueComment":"At an optimal value of \\>3, polygenic risk score yielded 90% sensitivity and 40% specificity for composite endpoint.","statisticalMethod":"z test","statisticalComment":"Area under receiver operating characteristic curve.","paramType":"C-statistic","paramValue":"0.66","ciPctValue":"95","ciNumSides":"TWO_SIDED","ciLowerLimit":"0.56","ciUpperLimit":"0.76","estimateComment":"The optimal cutoff value for polygenic risk score was set to \\>3."},{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001","OG002","OG003","OG004","OG005","OG006","OG007","OG008"],"groupDescription":"Cox proportional hazard model of the polygenic risk score\\<=3 and \\> 3 for the composite endpoint (stroke + myocardial infarction).
