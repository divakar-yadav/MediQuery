It has been documented that hemiplegic or hemiparetic stroke patients presented with more posture sway, asymmetric weight distribution, impaired weight-shifting ability and decreased stability capability. There are many balance exercises and strategies; to improve balance in elderly age group population, to prevent fall prevention. But we have very few evidences of giving manual perturbation balance training in stroke patients to improve speed, balance and function. Therefore this study is taken up to examine whether the manual perturbation balance training is more effective in improving speed, balance and function in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"There are many more studies done for elderly populations, normal individuals for improving balance by giving perturbation based balance training.All perturbation exercises are given by either mechanical or by self reaching tasks in forward,backward,and in both sideways. There are very studies ;who attempted perturbation based balance training to improve balance in elderly population but not for stroke patients for their Speed, Balance and Function.The manual perturbation exercise can be an promising intervention in the future for various conditions"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"manual perturbations were given in forward, Backward,right and left sideways, 10 perturbations were given,6 days in week,in fallowing positions- sitting,kneeling, standing positions","interventionNames":["Other: Perturbation","Other: Conventional Physiotherapy Treatment"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional Physiotherapy were given 6 days in a week, for 30 mins for 4 weeks, includes stretching, strengthening of contralateral limbs","interventionNames":["Other: Perturbation","Other: Conventional Physiotherapy Treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Perturbation","description":"Manual perturbations were given at waist region,over the Shoulders. in following positions- sitting, kneeling, standing positions,10 perturbations were given in forward,backward,both right and left side, 6 days in a week all precautionary measures taken for the patient's safety","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental Group"],"otherNames":["Manual Perturbation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Physiotherapy Treatment","description":"Conventional Physiotherapy treatment were given to participants included in this group for 30 mins daily for 4 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental Group"],"otherNames":["control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"patients ability of balance were assessed","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Independence Scale","description":"ability of Functional independent level for Activity Of Daily Living were assessed","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timed Up and Go Test","description":"patient's speed for performing Activity Of Daily Living were assessed by this test","timeFrame":"4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
