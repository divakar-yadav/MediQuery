Lead researcher applied the CTPT method. The tape was applied as following manner.\n\nBefore the first intervention day, participants with hair on their shoulder or upper arm were asked to shave the area. Two types of tape was used, a self-adhesive 1.5\" cotton undercover tape and a 1\" rigid strapping tape. Participants placed their affected arm on a supporting surface to better approximate the humeral head back into the glenoid fossa. The three pieces of rigid tape were applied to the patient's shoulder on top of the already applied self-adhesive cotton tape. The first piece (medial) was applied from 1.5\" below the deltoid tuberosity running straight up the middle of the arm to 2\" above the top of the glenoid fossa between the clavicle and the spine of the scapula. The second piece (posterior) was located from 1.5\" below the deltoid tuberosity to 1.5\" above the middle of the spine of the scapula. The medial border of this second piece ran along the acromial process. Last, the third piece (anterior) was located from 1.5\" below the deltoid tuberosity to run around the front of the humeral head and over the coracoid process, up to 1.5\" above the clavicle. The tape will removed and new tape applied every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and remained on the patient for 6 consecutive weeks.\n\nFollowing the 6 weeks, each patients of both group was individually re-assessed and evaluated the effect of intervention and parameters were recorded. The recording and measurement obtained before and after intervention was subjected to statistical analysis and the result of that interpreted to obtain the significance of study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subluxation of Inferior Shoulder"],"keywords":["Stroke, subluxation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"conventional","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"15 participants are allotted in this arm and each participants received conventional neuro rehabilitation programme 5 days a week for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: conventional neuro rehabilitation programme"]},{"label":"intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"15 participants allotted in this arm and each participants received California tri-pull taping method along with conventional neuro rehabilitation was given 5 days a week for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: conventional neuro rehabilitation programme","Other: California tri-pull taping (CTPT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional neuro rehabilitation programme","description":"All the conventional group subjects were received standardized conventional neuro rehabilitation programme.
