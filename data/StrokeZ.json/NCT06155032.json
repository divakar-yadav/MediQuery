Thus, a sizeable fraction of patients with a minor stroke that do not undergo cerebrovascular screening may experience an early neurological deterioration (END) due to LVO, possibly leading to poor long-term functional outcome. However, whether these patients may still benefit from a rescue EVT is unknown, especially in a late window (\\>24 hours). In this study, the investigators assume that best medical management plus EVT might be superior than best medical management alone in a late window for minor stroke patients who have experienced an LVO and END. The primary objective of the study was to establish the safety and efficacy of EVT in a late window for minor stroke patients in the anterior circulation who experienced an LVO and END.","detailedDescription":"The RESCUE END-LOW is a multicentered, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE) study. A total of approximately 272 patients (age ≥ 18 years) in a late window (\\>24 hours) with a minor stroke (NIHSS \\<6) who experienced an END and the imaging evidence of an occlusion of the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) terminus and/or Middle Cerebral Artery Main Stem (MCA M1) segment will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content. One group will receive best medical management alone the other group will receive best medical management plus EVT including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty or stenting. The primary objective is to establish the efficacy of EVT in a late window for patients with LVO and a minor stroke who have experienced an END. The study consists of seven visits including the day of randomization, 24 hours after randomization, 48 hours, 72 hours, 7 days or discharge, and 30 and 90 days. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the program. The primary endpoint is the rate of modified Rankin's scale (mRS) 0-2 at 90 days. The trial is anticipated to last from December 2023 to December 2025 with 272 subjects recruited form about 30 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee (EC) in Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Cerebrovascular; Disorder, Occlusive"],"keywords":["endovascular therapy","mild stroke","neurological deterioration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Drug: Best medical management Procedure: Endovascular therapy","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":272,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in this group will receive best medical management plus EVT including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty or stenting.\n\nIn the procedure, the methods including mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty and stenting can be used according to the local interventionalists' choice.
