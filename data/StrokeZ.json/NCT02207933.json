Reduced speed and asymmetry of stepping is a specific characteristic of hemiplegic gait. Asymmetry of stepping is characterized by shorter step length of the unaffected limb compared to the affected limb. Causes of this phenomenon are difficulty in weight bearing at the affected limb, weak propulsive force of the affected limb, and decreased strength of hip extensors. To correct these factors. we have developed an anteroposterior weight shifting training system with visual feedback and studied its effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegic Gait"],"keywords":["anterioposterior","weight","shifting","training","patient"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AP shifting group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: AP shifting training"]},{"label":"gait training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Procedure: Gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"AP shifting training","description":"AP shifting training in addition to gait training 3 times a week for 6 weeks","armGroupLabels":["AP shifting group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Gait training","description":"Gait training only for 3 times a week for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["gait training group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change of step Length Asymmetric Ratio","description":"paretic step length/non paretic step length","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"change of Step Length Asymmetric Index","description":"paretic step length-non paretic step length/0.5\\[paretic step length +non paretic step length","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
