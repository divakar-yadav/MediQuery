Each patient was subjected to assessment before and after the application of the rehabilitation program. Patients were randomized into two groups: group I who received therapy using the software aphasia rehabilitation program and group II who received conventional (traditional) language therapy. Therapy continued for 48 sessions over six months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["aphasia, post stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group I","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients who received rehabilitation using the software program for aphasia rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Behavioral: aphasia rehabilitation using software program or conventional therapy"]},{"label":"group II","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients who received rehabilitation using the conventional therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: aphasia rehabilitation using software program or conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"aphasia rehabilitation using software program or conventional therapy","description":"Patients were randomized into two groups: group I who received therapy using the software aphasia rehabilitation program and group II who received conventional (traditional) language therapy","armGroupLabels":["group I","group II"],"otherNames":["aphasia rehabilitation using the conventional language therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome was a measure of improvement in language abilities.","description":"The primary outcome was a measure of improvement in language abilities.
