The study links advances in thrombosis and inflammation biology, large-scale human genomics, and population and statistical genetics, with the unique resources of CHS, a large, bi-racial cohort of older adults. In older men and women without clinically apparent vascular disease, carotid intimal-medial thickness or IMT (a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis), C-reactive protein (a sensitive marker of inflammation), and D-dimer (a global marker of activation of the hemostatic system) predict subsequent clinical events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. While the therapeutic benefits of thrombolytic therapy and aspirin suggest a major role for clotting and inflammation in the etiology of coronary disease and stroke, the genetic determinants of these risk factors, which are also influenced by traditional lifestyle risk factors such as smoking and obesity, remain largely unexplored in older adults. The setting for this study is the Cardiovascular Health Study, a cohort study of 5888 older adults designed to assess risk factors for stroke and coronary disease. Data on traditional risk factors, on measures of subclinical disease, and cardiovascular events are available to the ancillary study. By integrating recent clinical and experimental data on age-related and vascular bed-specific regulation of blood coagulation, and incorporating complete human genomic DNA sequence variation data from the NHLBI-funded UW Program for Genomic Applications, the investigators will evaluate thoroughly the association of thrombosis and inflammation genes with (1) carotid IMT, CRP, and D-dimer levels measured at baseline and (2) incident MI and stroke in adults \\>65 years old followed for up to 12 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Disease","Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Cerebrovascular Accident","Myocardial Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL"},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"No eligibility criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Alexander Reiner","affiliation":"University of Washington"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000009203","term":"Myocardial Infarction"},{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6236","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6239","name":"Coronary Disease","asFound":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11845","name":"Myocardial Infarction","asFound":"Myocardial Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","asFound":"Infarction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","asFound":"Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19196","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
