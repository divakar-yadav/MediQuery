This study also aims to correlate the scale with the Modified Barthel Index and Frenchay Activities Index.","detailedDescription":"As per previous recommendation the English version of Nottingham Extended Activities Of Daily Living Scale will be translated into Urdu and it will be culturally adapted. Nottingham Extended Activities Of Daily Living Scale will be given to eighty individuals of stroke population which were selected on the basis of convenience sampling and the criteria of inclusion and exclusion. Study will investigate both inter-observer and intra-observer reliability of Nottingham Extended Activities Of Daily Living Scale, Modified Barthel Index and Frenchay Activities Index; the 2 set of questionnaire designed will be given to the participants on the same day to be filled, by two observers. And with a gap of half an hour between distributions of first two forms questionnaires will be given for inter-observer assessment. And after a time period of one week a third assessment will be collected by the first observer (intra-observer assessment). Statistical Package of Social Sciences Version 24 will be used for data entry and analysis. Cronbach alpha value will be used for checking internal consistency and intra-class correlation coefficient will be used to analyze test retest reliability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Nottingham Extended Activities Of Daily Living Scale","Urdu Version","Reliability","Validity","Stroke","Neurological Disorders","Activities of Daily Living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Nottingham Extended Activities Of Daily Living Scale","description":"The purpose of development of Nottingham Extended Activities Of Daily Living Scale was to use it for stroke patients. Each question on the scale is graded either 0 which means patient cannot perform task, 1 which means that patient can do activity but with assistance, 2 which states that task can be performed but with difficulty, 3 which means that he or she can perform the activity on his or her own easily. The score ranges from 0-66.","timeFrame":"1st day"},{"measure":"Frenchay Activities Index","description":"The Frenchay Activities Index is a tool for assessing instrumental activities of daily living in stroke patients. It is based upon the frequency in which activities are performed. Frenchay Activities Index scores vary from 0 (inactive) to 45 (very active), with 0-15 indicating inactivity, 16-30 indicating moderate activity, and 31-45 indicating extreme activity. A score of 18 or more than 18 was used to predict minor impairment following a stroke.","timeFrame":"1st day"},{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index","description":"The Barthel modified index scale is used to assess behavior related to daily tasks in stroke patients or those with other debilitating conditions. Each activity is given a score ranging from 0 (unable to complete task) to 5, 10, or 15 (highest) (fully independent- exact score depends on the activity being evaluated). Summing the scores for each of the items yields a total score.","timeFrame":"1st day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Having age of 67 years or more\n2.
