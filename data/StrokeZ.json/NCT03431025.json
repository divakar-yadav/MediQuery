Using or attempting to use the affected limb during activities of daily living, despite considerable difficulty, stimulates neuroplasticity and motor function recovery. The investigators are conducting a clinical study to test the efficacy of wrist-worn sensors that encourage affected limb use during activities of daily living."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants

Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at least 3 months prior to study enrollment\n* Mild-to-moderate to severe upper-limb motor impairments (as measured by a score between 21 and 50 on the arm section of the Fugl-Meyer scale).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cognitive impairments that would significantly interfere with their ability to follow instructions (as measured by a score lower than 23 on the Mini Mental State Examination scale)\n* Severe attention deficits or hemispatial neglect (as measured by the Mesulam Cancellation test and the Line Bisection test);\n* Severe range-of-motion limitations (as measured via physical examination) or severe spasticity (as measured using the Modified Ashworth scale) that would prevent safe performance of home-based exercises;\n* Proprioceptive deficits that impair their ability to process feedback (as measured using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper extremity; sensory section).\n* Implantable medical devices that are not compliant with the ISO 14117:2012 and/or ANSI/AAMI PC69 standards for Bluetooth compatibility. We will ask subjects to provide us with their medical device record card and verify that the device complies with the above-mentioned standards. If not, they will be excluded from the study.\n* Participation in upper-extremity rehabilitation program (i.e. outpatient occupational therapy, research study, ...).\n* Recent (\\< 3 months) Botox injection in the upper-extremity or plan to undergo injections during the study timeline.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Catherine Adans-Dester, PT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"617-952-6321","email":"cadans-dester@partners.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Joseph T Gwin, PhD","affiliation":"BioSensics","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Paolo Bonato, PhD","affiliation":"Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Charlestown","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02129","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Catherine Adans-Dester, PT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"617-952-6321","email":"cadans-dester@partners.org"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":42.37787,"lon":-71.062}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
