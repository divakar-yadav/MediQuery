Ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory\n2. Ipsilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery more than 50%\n3. Neurological deficit at the time of surgical treatment: the modified Rankin scale (mRs) score of 0-4 and the US National Institutes of Health (NIHSS) stroke scale score no more than 12\n4. The size of the ischemia focus: no more than 1/3 in the territory of the middle cerebral artery brain supply\n5. Terms of operation: from 1 to 28 days from the moment of ischemic stroke\n\nThe primary intra-hospital and/or 30-day study endpoints:\n\n1. Perioperative ipsilateral ischemic stroke.\n2. Any stroke: contralateral ischemic or any hemorrhagic stroke.\n3. Myocardial infarction.\n4.
