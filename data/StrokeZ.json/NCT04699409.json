No study has evaluated the effectiveness of these campaigns. This study aimed to compare recalling capacity of people in these two campaigns.","detailedDescription":"Cerebral vascular accidents have been one of the leading causes of death in Taiwan in recent years. In the modern medical system, treatment for hyperacute stroke including intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy. The faster patient received treatment, the better outcome he has.\n\nPrehospital delay of acute stroke treatment has been an important issue in modern medical system. Awareness of stroke symptoms and calling for medical help immediately is the most important part of stroke health education. The most used educational campaign is FAST.\n\nIn recent years, there is another stroke educational campaign called STROKE 112. Previous study had showed it has greater acceptance, since the number is easier to remember then letter, especially in non-English speaking countries.\n\nThe investigators had conducted a hospital-based randomized study in 2019, which revealed that STROKE 112 had similar, but not superior effectiveness with FAST. However, more study is needed for community-based population.\n\nThis study will compare and explore the effectiveness of two stroke educational campaigns, FAST and STROKE 112, on community-based population by using the questionnaire, in Yunlin, Taiwan. The result will been compared and analyzed with previous study, help us modify and enhance our current stroke educational program, shorten the prehospital delay, and improve outcomes of patients with acute stroke.\n\nThe subjects will be randomized into either group: FAST or STROKE 112. Then the investigator will give a 15min eduacation. The evaluation will be arranged 5 days and 30 days after the first education, and the outcome is the recalling capacity of the stroke symptoms in the educational campaign."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Cardiovascular"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FAST","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke education: FAST","interventionNames":["Other: stroke educational campaign: FAST"]},{"label":"STROKE 112","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke education: STROKE 112","interventionNames":["Other: stroke educational campaign: STROKE 112"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"stroke educational campaign: FAST","description":"After randomization, study staff provided 15-minute education on the selected campaign to each individual participant using educational pictures.","armGroupLabels":["FAST"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"stroke educational campaign: STROKE 112","description":"After randomization, study staff provided 15-minute education on the selected campaign to each individual participant using educational pictures.","armGroupLabels":["STROKE 112"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The recalling capacity of the stroke symptoms mentioned in each campaign","description":"Compare recalling capacity of people in these two campaigns: uneven face, weak arm, slurred speech.
