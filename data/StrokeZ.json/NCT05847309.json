In our center, most procedures are performed under general anesthesia, and once the procedure is complete, the patient is transferred intubated and sedated to the ICU. If the patient is hemodynamically and respiratory stable, the patient will be extubated, and will be discharged to the Neurology hospitalization floor.\n\nSeveral factors have been described that may influence the evolution and functional status at three months of patients who have suffered a stroke and have received endovascular treatment, such as the time between the onset of symptoms and admission to the ward for performing the procedure, the use of general anesthesia compared to sedation and local anesthesia, adequate control of blood pressure, the size of the cerebral infarct, or a worse neurological examination at the time of the procedure. In turn, several factors have been described that may influence the success of extubation in a patient who has suffered an acute ischemic stroke and who has required orotracheal intubation, such as the absence of dysarthria, the size of the infarct, the location of the infarction, the NIHSS (National Institutes of health Stroke Scale) or neurological status prior to orotracheal intubation. The investigators do not know, however, whether the time of mechanical ventilation can influence the evolution and functional status at three months of patients who have suffered a stroke and have received endovascular treatment under general anesthesia","detailedDescription":"The authors do not know whether the time of mechanical ventilation can influence the evolution and functional status at three months of patients who have suffered a stroke and have received endovascular treatment under general anesthesia. The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare the neurological functional status at 3 months according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS), of patients with stroke who underwent endovascular intervention with satisfactory results and who underwent early extubation (\\< 6 hours) compared to delayed extubation (6-12 hours)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Endovascular Treatment"],"keywords":["Stroke","endovascular treatment","Extubation","mechanical ventilation","functional status"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Intervention study, prospective, randomized, parallel and blind for the end point evaluators.
