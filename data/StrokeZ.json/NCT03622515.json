The patients with fragile brain have a high incidence of postoperative brain dysfunction. This study intends to apply EEG monitoring (Sedline) to CEA to investigate whether EEG monitoring can reduce the incidence of postoperative neurological complications in CEA patients and improve their prognosis.\n\n220 patients with CEA were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group S \\[Sedline monitoring + Transcranial Doppler (TCD) + regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rS02)，n=110\\] and group C \\[Bispectral index (BIS)/Sedline monitoring + TCD +rSO2,n=110\\], recording intraoperative and postoperative conditions, neuropsychology scale assessment, blood examination and imaging examination. The incidence of postoperative neurological complications was compared between the two groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transient Ischemic Attack","Acute Stroke","Postoperative Delirium","Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group S","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sedline monitoring Adjust the depth of anesthesia by adjusting the amount of anesthesia, and adjust the cerebral perfusion pressure by adjusting blood pressure","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Anesthesia level and cerebral perfusion pressure"]},{"label":"Group C","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Bispectral index (BIS)/Sedline monitoring"}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Anesthesia level and cerebral perfusion pressure","description":"Anesthetic dose and blood pressure","armGroupLabels":["Group S"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the change from baseline of neurological complications before operation","description":"Transient ischemic attack, acute stroke, postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, etc.","timeFrame":"after operation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the change from baseline of other complications before operation","description":"acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, pulmonary infection, atelectasis, acute kidney injury, etc.","timeFrame":"3 days after operation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
