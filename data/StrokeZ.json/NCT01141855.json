Where such patients have continued to smoke up until the time of admission, it can be assumed that \"primary\" prevention has failed.\n\nOnce admitted, there is a vastly under-utilised opportunity, by use of a structured and systematic approach, to intervene with a secondary prevention attempt. This takes advantage of the synergy of:\n\n1. the smoker is a \"captive audience\" and may be receptive to considering lifestyle factors that have lead to the admission, and\n2. best practice medication and counselling can be initiated prior to discharge. If proven to be cost-effective in our analysis, a systematic roll-out of this secondary prevention initiative would be advocated. ie translation of research into practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tobacco Use Disorder"],"keywords":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Peripheral Vascular Diseases","Cerebrovascular Stroke","Lung Diseases, Obstructive","Asthma","Tobacco Use Disorder","Smoking","Smoking Cessation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":392,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Champix plus counselling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"varenicline tartrate will be initiated whilst subjects are inpatients with the standard MIMS dosing schedule (including period of titration).
