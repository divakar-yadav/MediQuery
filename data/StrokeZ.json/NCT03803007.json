At the starting level, 8 patients received either glenzocimab at the lowest pharmacologically active dose of 125 mg (n=4) or the matching placebo(n=4). After real-time review by the DSMB of clinical safety and a CT scan (and where available MRI) and giving a favorable opinion, the next patients were randomized in the second cohort (n=8) with 4 patients under a higher dose of 250 mg, 2 patients remaining at the initial starting dose (125 mg), and 2 patients under placebo. Following the same process, and after favorable opinion from the DSMB, patients were randomized in the third cohort (n=10) and received glenzocimab 500 mg (n=4), randomized versus 250 mg (n=2), 125 mg (n=2) or placebo (n=2). Similarly, the fourth cohort (n=12) randomized patients between ahigher dose of 1000 mg (n=4), versus 500 mg (n=2), 250 mg (n=2), 125 mg (n=2), or placebo (n=2). Once this fourth cohort completed, the DSMB issued a further positive opinion and the fifth cohort (n=22) randomized patients to 1000 mg (n=8), versus 500 mg (n=6), 250 mg (n=4), 125 mg (n=2), or placebo (n=2).\n\nConsolidation Phase with Final Dose (Phase 2a):\n\nAfter having reviewed patient's safety data included in the first part of the study, the DSMB confirmed that the study can continue with the glenzocimab recommended dose of 1000 mg. During this phase, a group of 100 patients will be treated, 50 with glenzocimab and 50 with matching placebo to complete the group of 160 patients planned to participate in this study.\n\nIn addition, patients in each treatment arm will be stratified by type of Standard of Care (SOC) administered:\n\n* Thrombolysis with tPA only;\n* Thrombolysis with tPA AND mechanical thrombectomy Each treatment arm will contain 25 patients with one SOC, and 25 with the other SOC. The active glenzocimab dose will be that recommended after the last safety analysis has been performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Haemorrhages","Thrombolysis","Thrombectomy","Anti-platelet","glenzocimab","ACT017","stroke","GPVI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"The phase Ib of the study with a sequential design has been achieved (5 arms).
