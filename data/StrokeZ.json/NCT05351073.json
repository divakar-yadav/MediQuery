Neuroprotective treatment is considered as a promising adjuvant to ameliorate this situation. Previous researches demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of Normobaric Hyperoxia (NBO) in animal models from multiple perspectives. Moreover, NBO is distinctive for its ubiquity, conveniency, high compatibility, and wide adaptability, making it superior to other neuroprotective interventions in a pre-hospital setting. Therefore, the investigators conducted this pilot study to further explore the feasibility and safety of NBO under a pre-hospital condition in patients with suspected stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Acute stroke","Normobaric oxygen","Stroke neuroprotection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normobaric Oxygen Inhalation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the intervention group will receive oxygen inhalation through a mask at a rate of 10 L/min at 1 absolute atmosphere pressure (1 ATA = 101.325 kPa) after randomization until adimisson to the hospital.
