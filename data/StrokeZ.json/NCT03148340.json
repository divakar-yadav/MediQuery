Known or suspected traumatic brain injury, either closed or penetrating.\n2. Contraindication to neuroimaging, such as a contrast allergy, or other condition that prohibits CT, MRI, and/or angiography.\n3. Presence of any implanted electro-stimulating devices in the head and neck.\n4. Presence of any large metallic craniofacial implants, such as bone fixation plates, mesh, et cetera. (Note that small metallic objects, such an aneurysm coils, are acceptable.)\n5.

Inability to wear the investigational device (skin lesions on scalp, previous intracranial surgeries, etc.).\n8. Pregnant or nursing.\n9. Any other condition, which in the judgment of the PI would prevent the patient from completing the study or tolerating monitoring sessions and brain imaging, such as mental illness, severe agitation, or hemodynamic instability.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Males and females, aged 18 years or older, who are undergoing evaluation for acute ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Lyerly Baptist, Inc","city":"Jacksonville","state":"Florida","zip":"32207","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":30.33218,"lon":-81.65565}},{"facility":"University of Buffalo","city":"Buffalo","state":"New York","zip":"14203","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.88645,"lon":-78.87837}},{"facility":"The Mount Sinai Hospital","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10029","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}},{"facility":"Medical University of South Carolina","city":"Charleston","state":"South Carolina","zip":"29425","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.77657,"lon":-79.93092}},{"facility":"University of Tennessee Health Science Center","city":"Memphis","state":"Tennessee","zip":"38163","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":35.14953,"lon":-90.04898}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19834014","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Smith WS, Lev MH, English JD, Camargo EC, Chou M, Johnston SC, Gonzalez G, Schaefer PW, Dillon WP, Koroshetz WJ, Furie KL.
