The tool will then be tested in surrogates of hospitalized stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Decision support tools, specifically recommended in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been shown to improve the quality of decisions and reduce burden on the decision maker in multiple clinical settings, yet almost none have focused on life-sustaining treatments in acute critical illness such as stroke. This study proposes a comprehensive frame shift in how the health care team and surrogates collaborate on decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments for acute illness, by developing a tailored web-based stroke decision support intervention. This web-based tool will be developed for use by the surrogate decision maker during the acute stroke hospitalization and will be designed to facilitate high quality patient-centered decisions and minimize adverse effects on the surrogate.\n\nThe two project phases are: 1) Decision support intervention development; and 2) Pilot testing in surrogates of hospitalized stroke patients. A novel ordinal prognostic model will be developed and incorporated into the tool.\n\nThe project expects 25 surrogate-patient pairs in the control group, and 25 surrogate-patient pairs in the intervention group, which equals a total of 100 subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["surrogate decision maker"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":106,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Surrogate Arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual care control group will complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires with standard decision making techniques.
