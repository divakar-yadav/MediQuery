Furthermore, exploratory analyses of cardiologic-electrophysiologic and immunologic parameters will be performed.","detailedDescription":"The main objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of propranolol in middle cerebral artery stroke patients. The primary hypothesis is as follows: Early administration of propranolol reduces the frequency of cardiovascular and/or neurological complications including vascular death in the first 30 days after acute ischemic stroke. Secondary hypotheses are as follows: Early administration of propranolol improves neurological and functional outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Early administration of propranolol reduces post-stroke immunodepression and therefore lowers the rate of pneumonia after acute ischemic stroke, without increasing the frequency of auto-aggressive, CNS antigen-specific T cells. Early administration of propranolol influences alterations in cardiologic, electrophysiologic phenomenons as a reaction to autonomic dysregulation after acute ischemic stroke. Early administration of Propranolol reduces growth of infarct as determined by MRI examinations in the first 6 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Propranolol","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug:
