Nevertheless randomized trials did not enroll patients under the age of 18 years old and data concerning these treatments in children are scarce. As it is much less frequent than in adults, recognition of stroke is often delayed in children. Consequently, acute phase trials are difficult to set up and perform. The phase I multicentric international prospective trial TIPS (Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke) was prematurely stopped because of poor enrollment. Published retrospective regional (Paris-Ile-de-France region, France) and national (Switzerland) studies addressed the feasibility of such treatments but, because of small samples (less than 20 patients in each study), efficiency and prognostic factors could not be addressed.\n\nExhaustive retrospective studies in a definite geographic area but with a sufficient number of patients in a limited inclusion period would provide these crucial data and address these questions with good relevance and limited bias."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Arterial Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","children","recanalization treatment","thrombolysis","thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arterial ischemic stroke in patients less than 18 years old","description":"Patients \\< 18 years old\n\n* Suspected or confirmed cerebral infarction\n* With recanalization treatment in the acute phase: intra-venous thrombolysis +/- intra-arterial thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy\n* Patients treated between January 2015, 1st and May 2018, 31st"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Acute management of stroke:","description":"Median time from symptom onset to Imaging (minutes)","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Acute management of stroke:","description":"Median time from symptom onset to beginning of recanalization treatment (minutes)","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Acute management of stroke:","description":"Median door-to-needle delay (minutes)","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Treatment-emergent adverse events:","description":"Intracranial hemorrhage (yes/no)","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Treatment-emergent adverse events:","description":"clinically symptomatic (yes/no)","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Treatment-emergent adverse events:","description":"Peripheral hemorrhage (yes/no)","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"factors potentially associated with clinical outcome: univariate and multivariate analysis, step by step analysis","description":"age of onset (year, months)","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"factors potentially associated with clinical outcome: univariate and multivariate analysis, step by step analysis","description":"Mechanism of stroke (CASCADE classification)","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"factors potentially associated with clinical outcome: univariate and multivariate analysis, step by step analysis","description":"stroke location (name of artery territory)","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"factors potentially associated with clinical outcome: univariate and multivariate analysis, step by step analysis","description":"time from symptom onset to beginning of recanalization treatment (minutes)","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"factors potentially associated with clinical outcome: univariate and multivariate analysis, step by step analysis","description":"initial imagine ASPECT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. score (units on an scale).
