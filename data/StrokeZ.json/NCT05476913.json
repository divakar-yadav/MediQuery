The aim is to assess the prevention of VTE during a follow-up period of 90 days (three months) post-randomisation.","detailedDescription":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disabling and potentially fatal outcome that may be acquired after having a stroke. The standard treatment to prevent the development of VTE is to give anticoagulation medication. However, this is not recommended in the UK after stroke. Instead the recommended treatment is Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC), where cuffs placed around the lower legs are filled with air to help squeeze the legs and induce blood flow. However, not all patients are able to receive or tolerate IPC treatment. Another treatment which has shown promising results to prevent VTE in immobile patients after stroke, is with a medical device called the geko™ device. The geko™ device is a CE marked medical device which means the manufacturer has checked that the device complies with the essential safety and performance requirements for its' intended use which is to increase blood circulation to help prevent VTE. The aim of this study is to determine if the geko™ device is more effective at preventing VTE in immobile acute stroke patients, than the current IPC standard of care treatment. Following the consent process, stroke patients will be randomised to receive either IPC or geko device. Both devices will be applied until the patient can walk again without help, or for a maximum of 30 days. A Doppler exam of the legs will be conducted after 7 days and after 14 days, or at discharge if the patient recovers earlier. A follow-up including a patient questionnaire about the comfort of the device, as well as additional health information will be collected after 30 days, or at discharge if earlier. A final follow-up will then be conducted over the phone after 90 days to find out about the patient's recovery, health, mobility and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Venous Thromboembolism","Deep Vein Thrombosis","Pulmonary Embolism"],"keywords":["geko","intermittent pneumatic compression","Stroke, Acute","Venous Thromboembolism","Pulmonary Embolism","DVT prophylaxis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Standard block randomisation","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The trial will be single blind for the primary outcome.
