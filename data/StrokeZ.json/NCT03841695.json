The participants will be randomized assigned to treatment group (TG, robot assisted treatment) and control group (CG, conventional treatment). In the experimental group, task oriented bi-manual training will be applied using the unaffected hand to guide the affected hand by RMTC robot system. The investigators will estimate the motor function of distal part of upper-limb before and after treatments. The results will be compared with the convention rehabilitation treatment. The primary outcomes are Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA); and the secondary outcome measurements are modified Ashworth scale (MAS),Action Reach Arm Test (ARAT), Box \\& block test、Brunnstrom recovery Stage, and motor activity log (MAL).","detailedDescription":"Clinical reports indicated the functional recovery of the distal part of upper limb in stroke patient needs time period longer than other body parts, and there is a limitation in the efficiency of conventional treatment on the distal part of upper limb. Robot assisted rehabilitation is a novel application in treatment. Rehabilitation robot is able to assist patients move the affected side through external power to achieve a repeated exercising and further evoke the motor function. In the present study, the wearable RMTC finger-hand robot and combined with the mechanism of neuroplasticity will be used on the upper-limb rehabilitation of stroke patients. The patient (post stroke\\>1 month) age from 20-90 years old with Modified Ashworth Scale ≦2, Brunnstrom Recovery Stage of Arm ≧ 2, Mini-Mental State Examination ≧24 will be included as our participation. The participants will be randomized assigned to treatment group (TG, robot assisted treatment, n=30) and control group (CG, conventional treatment, n=30). In the treatment group, task oriented bi-manual training will be applied using the unaffected hand to guide the affected hand by RMTC robot system, the patient will also receive additional conventional treatment. In the control group, the patient will receive 100 minutes conventional treatment. The investigators will estimate the motor function of distal part of upper-limb before and after treatments. The results will be compared with the convention rehabilitation treatment. The primary outcomes are Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA); and the secondary outcome measurements are modified Ashworth scale (MAS),Action Reach Arm Test (ARAT), Box \\& block test、Brunnstrom recovery Stage, and motor activity log (MAL). The investigators will follow up the patient at the 3rd and 6th month after complete trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental group received Robot Assisted Training (RMTC finger-hand robot (Mirror Hand)) and traditional occupation therapy (Conventional OT) for 1 hour and forty minutes.","interventionNames":["Device: RMTC finger-hand robot (Mirror Hand)","Other: Conventional OT"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group received traditional occupation therapy (Conventional OT) for 1 hour and forty minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional OT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RMTC finger-hand robot (Mirror Hand)","description":"The robotic hand will apply on the patient's affected hand and the sensor glove will apply on the patient's un-affected hand, the patient can manipulate their affected hand by their un-affected hand and do the task oriented bimanual training.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional OT","description":"The focus of occupational therapy is to help individuals achieve health, well-being, and participation in life through engagement in activities (American Occupational Therapy Association \\[AOTA\\], 2014).
