The objective is to compare the efficacy and tolerance (net benefit) of two antithrombotic strategies in patients with atherothrombosis of the aortic arch and a recent (less than 6 months) cerebral or peripheral embolic event.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe association of clopidogrel 75 mg/d plus aspirin 75 mg/d is 25% more effective than an oral anticoagulant (target International Normalized Ratio \\[INR\\] 2 to 3) in preventing brain infarction, brain hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, peripheral embolism, and vascular death.","detailedDescription":"Patients with Transient Ischemic attack or brain infarction of unknown cause (no ipsilateral internal carotid artery origin stenosis greater than 70%, no ipsilateral severe intracranial stenosis of an artery supplying the infarcted area, no definite cardiac source of embolism) in the preceding 6 months and atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n≥ 4 mm in the aortic arch, or patients with a peripheral event (e.g. renal infarct) in the preceding 6

in the preceding 6 months:\n\n  * Transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n  * Non-disabling brain infarcts:\n\n    * Inclusion within 6 months after onset\n    * Duration of symptoms and signs greater than 24 hours\n    * Neurological signs at the time of randomization with a Rankin Scale grade 3 or less\n    * With normal computed tomography (CT) scan or CT scan showing a brain infarct (even hemorrhagic infarct)\n  * Peripheral embolism\n* Atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta is defined as wall thickness ≥ 4 mm where the protruding material is the largest, measured at transesophageal echocardiography with multiplane transducer or a plaque less than 4 mm but with mobile component.\n* Informed consent signed\n* Life expectancy \\> 3 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Other causes of embolism:\n\n  * Cardiac: endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, intra-cardiac thrombus, valvular prosthesis, rheumatic valvulopathy, left ventricular aneurysm, or ejection fraction less than 25%\n  * Atherosclerotic stenosis ipsilateral to the embolic territory: internal carotid artery stenosis greater than 70%, or severe (judgment of the investigator) intracranial stenosis, or scheduled carotid endarterectomy (in that case inclusion is possible 30 days after the procedure)\n  * Uncommon causes: dissection, vasculitis, procoagulant state, or sickle cell disease\n* Other exclusion criteria:\n\n  * Intercurrent illness with life expectancy less than 36 months\n  * Pregnancy and non-menopausal women\n  * Unwillingness to participate\n  * Poor medication compliance expected\n  * Toxicomania\n  * Absolute indication for anticoagulant therapy (e.g. atrial fibrillation, intracardiac thrombus, prosthetic valve)\n  * Scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (randomization is possible 30 days after endarterectomy)\n* CT scan with an intracranial lesion other than brain infarction (space occupying mass, intracranial hemorrhage)\n* Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with plaque ≥ 4 mm in thickness distal to the supposed embolized artery (judgement of the investigator).\n* Contraindication to clopidogrel, aspirin, and oral
