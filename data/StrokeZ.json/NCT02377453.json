Cerebral vascular accident (CVA) is the common disorder for acquired brain damage. Neural network in patients with brain damage could also be used to determine their clinical behavior by identifying altered neural network associated with behavioral improvement. The investigators hypothesize that the level of brain image and biomechanical will change with time in patients with stroke. Under this hypothesis, the measures of biomechanical change are correlated with neural changes. The aim of this study is to investigate the function and participation in patients with stroke evaluated by clinical measures, biomechanical, psychological, physiological and multimodal brain image. The primary goal of this study is to establish, evaluate and follow-up biomechanical- and image-based biomarkers for the impairment of function and participation information processing present in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","participation","brain imaging","biomechanical"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","description":"Control: Healthy adult"},{"label":"Experimental","description":"Experimental: patients with stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline of biomechanical measurement for Healthy adult and patients with stroke in 6 months and 12 months","description":"Muscle tone, Muscle strength and Kinematic analysis for upper limb and gait analysis","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis in 6 months and 12 months","description":"fc(functional connectivity)MRI at resting, active-task fMRI. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of psychological in 6 months and 12 months","description":"CANTAB touchscreen","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of body composition in 6 months and 12 months","description":"InBody230 Body Composition Analyzer","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of severity in 6 months and 12 months","description":"Brunnstrom stage classification, Modified Ashworth Scale and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of body in 6 months and 12 months","description":"Minimal Mental State Examination, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Fugl-Meyer assessment, Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Action Research Arm Test and Box and Block Test","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of activity in 6 months and 12 months","description":"Barthel Index, Wolf motor function test, Motor activity log, Walking test, Timed 'Up \\& Go' test and Functional Independence Measure","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of participation in 6 months and 12 months","description":"Adaptive behavior assessment system and Nottingham Health Profile","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Change from baseline of quality of life in 6 months and 12 months","description":"Stroke Impact Scale","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months, 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
