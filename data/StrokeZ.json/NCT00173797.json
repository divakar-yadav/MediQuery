In the first part, we will spend 3 years in recruiting 200 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of first stroke onset to compare the validity, responsiveness, and acceptability of the HAMD, HADS, and BDI. All patients will be assessed using the three depression scales and other functional measures at 14, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days after stroke.\n\nIn the second part, the inter-rater reliability of the three depression scales will be examined in the first year. Sixty chronic stroke patients will be recruited in the study.\n\nFurthermore, the other 60 chronic stroke patients will be recruited in the second year for examining the test-retest reliability and measurement error of the three depression scales.\n\nThis study would be the first one to systematically compare the psychometric properties of the three depression scales in a long-term follow up study. The results of the study will be able to help clinicians and researchers select the most suitable depression scales for stroke patients. The results will also provide us references to develop a new depression scale, if needed, for stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accidents"],"keywords":["depression","psychometrics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"DEFINED_POPULATION","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\npatients with a diagnosis stroke ability to complete questionnaires\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\npatients with other major diseases (e.g., cancer)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"0 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ching-Lin Hsieh, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-23123456","phoneExt":"7567","email":"clhsieh@ntu.edu.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ching-Lin Hsieh, PhD","affiliation":"School of Occupational Therapy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"School of Occupational Therapy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taipei","zip":"100","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Ching-Lin Hsieh, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-23123456","phoneExt":"7567","email":"clhsieh@ntu.edu.tw"},{"name":"Ching-Lin Hsieh, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000003863","term":"Depression"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001526","term":"Behavioral Symptoms"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6748","name":"Depression","asFound":"Depression","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6751","name":"Depressive Disorder","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4508","name":"Behavioral Symptoms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
