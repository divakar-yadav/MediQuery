Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults all around the world. Stroke survivors can suffer several neurological impairments and deficits which have an important impact on patient's quality of life and which increase the costs for health and social services. After stroke, impairments in ADLs and functional status, deterioration in health related quality of life can be seen.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to Determine the effect of Aerobic exercise training on Balance, Walking capacity and quality of life in sub-acute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular accident","Treadmill Training","High-intensity interval training","Walking capacity."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Based on the functional capacity of each participant, customized Aerobic exercise plan was designed by the on-site physiotherapist.","interventionNames":["Other: High intensity Interval Training"]},{"label":"Combined Training (conventional rehabilitation plus high-intensity interval training):","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients received 40 minutes of High intensity interval treadmill training in addition to their normal conventional rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Other: High intensity Interval Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"High intensity Interval Training","description":"All the participants underwent 5 weeks of High intensity interval training.","armGroupLabels":["Combined Training (conventional rehabilitation plus high-intensity interval training):","Conventional Rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 Minute walk Test","description":"To determine the cardiorespiratory fitness of individual after sub-acute stroke.","timeFrame":"5 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance test and rating scale","description":"The scale is used to determine the Balance and stability of patient.
