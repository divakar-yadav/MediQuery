This is to lay the groundwork for a larger RCT on the same topic. Twenty patients greater than 6 months post-stroke will be randomly assigned into one of four following treatment groups: (i) aerobic training (AEROBIC group), (ii) cognitive training (COGNITIVE group), (iii) aerobic exercise plus cognitive training (AEROBIC+COGNITIVE group); and (iv) non-aerobic range of motion (ROM) and unstructured mental activity (CONTROL group) (for group descriptions, please see detailed description below). We hypothesize that the combination of aerobic exercise and cognitive training will be more effective in improving cognition after stroke than either treatment on its own.","detailedDescription":"Aerobic exercise: Body weight support (BWS) treadmill exercise at moderately high intensity (60-70% of heart rate reserve) using 15-30% BWS. An additional 6-10 min will be needed for warm-up and cool-down. Heart rate will be continuously monitored, and blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured periodically.\n\nCognitive training: Computerized dual n-back training program that involves a working memory task, the difficulty of which adapts to the individual participant's performance.\n\nROM exercise: Non-aerobic passive and active movement of upper and lower extremity joints performed with the subject lying on a plinth. RPE will be recorded every 5 minutes to ensure intensity remains low. Mental activities: Unstructured mental activity: such as listening to light novels on tape, which will be selected by the subject from a pre-determined list."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AEROBIC group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"6-week program of one 20-min session of aerobic training and one 20-min session of ROM exercise 5 days/week.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic training","Behavioral: Range of motion exercise"]},{"label":"COGNITIVE group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"6-week program of one 20-min session of cognitive training and one 20-min session of ROM exercise 5 days/week.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Cognitive training","Behavioral: Range of motion exercise"]},{"label":"AEROBIC + COGNITIVE group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"6-week program of one 20-min session of aerobic training and one 20-min session of cognitive training 5 days/week.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Aerobic training","Behavioral: Cognitive training"]},{"label":"CONTROL group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"6-week program of one 20-min session of ROM exercise and one 20-min session of unstructured mental activity 5 days/week.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Range of motion exercise","Behavioral: Unstructured mental activity"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Aerobic training","description":"One 20-min session of body weight support treadmill training at moderate to high intensity (60-70% heart rate reserve) 5 days/week for 6-weeks.","armGroupLabels":["AEROBIC + COGNITIVE group","AEROBIC group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Cognitive training","description":"One 20-min session of cognitive training (computerized dual n-back training program) 5 days/week for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["AEROBIC + COGNITIVE group","COGNITIVE group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Range of motion exercise","description":"One 20-min session of range of motion exercise (non-aerobic passive and active movement of upper and lower extremity) 5 days/week for 6-weeks.","armGroupLabels":["AEROBIC group","COGNITIVE group","CONTROL group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Unstructured mental activity","description":"One 20-min session of unstructured mental activity (e.g., listening to light novels on tape) 5 days/week for 6-weeks.","armGroupLabels":["CONTROL group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Flanker Test","description":"Flanker Test is a computerized test of selective attention and reaction time that involves a motor response.
