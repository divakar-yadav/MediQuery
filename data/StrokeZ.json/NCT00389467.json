The blockage is often caused by a clot. There is currently only one FDA-approved stroke treatment. However, only 2 percent of ischemic stroke patients receive this treatment because it must be given within 4.5 hours of the stroke onset. There is an overwhelming need for new treatments that extend the time window to treatment since most individuals with stroke arrive at the hospital after the 4.5-hour time window.\n\nTwo of the most promising new devices are the Merci Retriever, a tiny corkscrew device, and the Penumbra System, an aspiration device. Both are designed to remove clots from arteries and thereby restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of treatment with the Merci Retriever or Penumbra System within 8 hours of symptom onset to standard medical treatment, and to identify people who might benefit from the devices by the appearance of the stroke on multimodal computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previous testing has determined that the use of the Merci Retriever is successful in opening up blocked blood vessels in approximately ½ of the individuals in whom it is used, and the Penumbra System is successful in opening up blocked blood vessels in approximately 80% of the individuals in whom it is used.\n\nA total of 120 participants from approximately 30 different medical centers will be enrolled into this study. Participants will be randomized to either receive treatment by mechanical embolectomy with the Merci Retriever or Penumbra System and standard medical care or treatment with standard medical care alone. Standard care for stroke patients may include intravenous fluid, careful regulation of blood pressure, blood-thinning medicine (such as heparin or warfarin), anti-platelet medicine (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), and rehabilitation therapies.\n\nParticipants undergoing the Merci Retriever or Penumbra System procedure will have a cerebral arteriogram with pictures taken with dye prior to the procedure to determine the location of the blockage, and following the procedure to determine if blood supply has been restored. The total mechanical embolectomy procedure with either device will take approximately 1 to 2 hours. Participants will have brief neurological exams several times during this time to monitor changes in their neurological condition.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up visits, including neurological exams, at 30 days and at 90 days.\n\nThis study is part of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS), which allows researchers to enhance and initiate translational research that ultimately will benefit stroke patients by treating more patients in less than 2 hours, and finding ways to treat additional patients later."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","ischemic stroke","blood clot","Merci Retriever","Penumbra System","embolectomy","magnetic resonance imaging","MRI","CT","SPOTRIAS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":127,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1 Mechanical Embolectomy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be randomized to receive mechanical embolectomy treatment either with the Merci Retriever or Penumbra System and standard medical care or treatment with standard medical care alone.","interventionNames":["Device: Merci Retriever and Penumbra System"]},{"label":"2","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"standard medical care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Merci Retriever and Penumbra System","description":"The MERCI (Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia) Retriever consists of a flexible, nickel titanium (nitinol) wire with a helical-shaped distal tip.
