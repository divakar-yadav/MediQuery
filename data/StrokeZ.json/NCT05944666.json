The patients in the main and comparison groups will be comparable in age, gender and symptoms.\n\nEach participant of the study will be assigned an ordinal number. Patients of the main groups are planned to undergo a rehabilitation course with standardized multimodal correction, depending on the severity of functional and neuropsychological disturbances with the use of FBF-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training with double and triple tasks in a virtual environment, functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), training of subject-manipulative activity for the restoration of fine hand movements on the glove simulator \"SensoRehab\"; when severe and moderate paresis of the upper limb, the neurointerface \"Exokist-2\" with EEG registration will be used.\n\nThe patients of comparison groups are planned to undergo a rehabilitation course with standart rehabilitation programms depending on the severity of functional and neuropsychological disturbances: kinesiotherapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage.\n\nThe study is carried out at the inpatient stage, then patients are transferred to the outpatient stage of rehabilitation or controlled home self-rehabilitation using telemedicine technologies.\n\nThe mode of application of multimodal correction technology:\n\ninpatient stage: 10 procedures every day (5 working days, 2 days the rest);the total duration of one procedure is 2-3 hours a day.\n\noutpatient stage: 15 procedures, 2-3 times a week, the duration of the course is 5-8 weeks. The total duration of one procedure is 2-3 hours a day.\n\nMultimodal correction technology will not be included in the rehabilitation program of patients in the comparison group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke rehabilitation","post-stroke dysfunction of the hand","cognitive disfunction","artificial intelligence","virtual reality","neurointerface","smart glove","biofeedback","cardiology risk control","lower limb medical rehabilitation","digital interactive technology","standartized rehabilitation technologies","verification of the rehabilitation potential"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":405,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Medical rehabilitation (MR) in acute period of IS-inpatient stage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Devices Patients in acute period of IS receive a course of standart MR-program and in main group - rehabilitation with multimodal correction using and BFB-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training in a virtual environment (VR), functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), subject-manipulative activity training to restore fine movements of the hand on a glove simulator, if moderate paresis of the upper limb - the neurointerface \"Exokist-2\" with EEG registration.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Multimodal technology (MT)","Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"MR in early recovery period of IS- inpatient stage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Devices Patients in the early recovery period of IS receive a course of standart MR-program and in main group - rehabilitation with multimodal correction using and BFB-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training in a virtual environment (VR), functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), subject-manipulative activity training to restore fine movements of the hand on a glove simulator, if moderate paresis of the upper limb - the neurointerface \"Exokist-2\" with EEG registration.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Multimodal technology (MT)","Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"MR in late recovery period of IS-inpatient stage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Devices Patients in the late recovery period of IS receive a course of standart MR-program and in main group - rehabilitation with multimodal correction using and BFB-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training in a virtual environment (VR), functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), subject-manipulative activity training to restore fine movements of the hand on a glove simulator, if moderate paresis of the upper limb - the neurointerface \"Exokist-2\" with EEG registration.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Multimodal technology (MT)","Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"MR in early recovery period of IS - outpatient stage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Devices Patients in the early recovery period of IS receive a course of standart MR-program and in main group - rehabilitation with multimodal correction using and BFB-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training in a virtual environment (VR), functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), subject-manipulative activity training to restore fine movements of the hand on a glove simulator, if moderate paresis of the upper limb - the neurointerface \"Exokist-2\" with EEG registration.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Multimodal technology (MT)","Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"MR in late recovery period of IS - outpatient stage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Devices Patients in the late recovery period of IS receive a course of standart MR-program and in main group - rehabilitation with multimodal correction using and BFB-stabilometric training, cognitive-motor training in a virtual environment (VR), functional individually programmed stimulation of antagonist muscles of the lower limb (FES), subject-manipulative activity training to restore fine movements of the hand on a glove simulator, if moderate paresis of the upper limb - the neurointerface \"Exokist-2\" with EEG registration.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Multimodal technology (MT)","Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Multimodal technology (MT)","description":"Only fo the patients of the Main group.
