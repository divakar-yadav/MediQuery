User-friendly home therapy robots and a telerehabilitation system are combined to monitor and provide therapy that is accessible for patients in rural and underserved locations. The robotic-based home therapy intervention will produce significantly greater improvement in upper extremity motor function than Usual and Customary Care enhanced with a (non-robotic) home therapy upper extremity rehabilitation program at the end of 8 weeks of home therapy.","detailedDescription":"The primary purpose of this proposal is to evaluate a combined clinic/home robotic-based stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system in rural and underserved locations that provides accessible, effective and affordable care for stroke survivors with residual limb impairment. The study is a prospective, single-blind, multi-site Randomized Controlled Trial. A total of 96 patients within 6 months post-stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: robotic based home therapy or a self administered (non-robotic) home therapy program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke Rehabilitation","Home rehabilitation","robotic therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":99,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hand Mentor Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Use of the Hand Mentor (TM) Stroke Therapy Device at home for 8 weeks","interventionNames":["Device: Hand Mentor (TM) robotic stroke therapy device"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Self administered home therapy program","interventionNames":["Device: Home Therapy Program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hand Mentor (TM) robotic stroke therapy device","description":"The goal of the Hand Mentor ™ (TM) device is to improve Active Range of Motion in the distal musculature of the paretic limb of patients with stroke.
