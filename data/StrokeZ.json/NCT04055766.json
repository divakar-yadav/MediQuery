After informed consent is given to the patient who meet the inclusion criteria, open the DeepDoc to fill in the patient identification information. Then take the picture of the initial diagnosis of the admission note page and upload it to DeepDoc, fill the doctor's initial diagnosis into the DeppDoc. And put the patient's clinical data points into the DeepDoc to get a DeepdDoc diagnosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Headache","Vertigo","Meningitis/Encephalitis"],"keywords":["Artificial Intelligence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Meningitis/Encephalitis","description":"Patients with clinical signs and symptoms suspected of meningitis/encephalitis","interventionNames":["Device: DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System"]},{"label":"Stroke","description":"Patients with clinical signs and symptoms suspected of stroke","interventionNames":["Device: DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System"]},{"label":"Headache","description":"Patients with clinical signs and symptoms suspected of headache","interventionNames":["Device: DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System"]},{"label":"Vertigo","description":"Patients with clinical signs and symptoms suspected of vertigo","interventionNames":["Device: DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System","description":"Patients are diagnosed by the DeepDoc within 24 hours of admission.","armGroupLabels":["Headache","Meningitis/Encephalitis","Stroke","Vertigo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of diagnosis by DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System","description":"Accuracy of diagnosis by DeepDoc and compare this result with doctors","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sensitivity of diagnosis by DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System","description":"Sensitivity of diagnosis by DeepDoc and compare this result with doctors","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Specificity of diagnosis by DeepDoc AI-based Decision Support System","description":"Specificity of diagnosis by DeepDoc and compare this result with doctors","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
