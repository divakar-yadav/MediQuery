Both hydrogen and minocycline have excellent safety profiles, have been previously demonstrated individually to reduce infarction in animal models of stroke, and have potentially synergistic mechanisms of action against ischemic brain damage. The mechanisms of action of both agents would be specifically relevant to patients receiving tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or thrombectomy, and achieving some degree of therapeutic reperfusion.\n\nThis will be a double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible and willing subjects will be randomly assigned to be treated with either H2M or placebo, in addition to standard treatments. The treatment with H2M or placebo will start as soon as possible after diagnosis of stroke, and continue for three days (hydrogen) and five days (minocycline) respectively. Measures of stroke severity and disability will be recorded at baseline, and through a follow-up phone call (45 days) and clinic visit (90 days)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["neuroprotection","antioxidant"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hydrogen/Minocycline","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hydrogen will be infused into aqueous solution (normal saline or water) at as high a concentration as possible (saturation = 1.6 ppm), and administered intravenously or orally respectively, TID for 3 days.\n\nSimilarly, Minocycline will be administered either i.v. or p.o. once daily for 5 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Hydrogen","Drug: Minocycline"]},{"label":"Placebo Hydrogen/Placebo Minocycline","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Normal saline will be substituted for both Hydrogen and Minocycline for intravenous administration.
