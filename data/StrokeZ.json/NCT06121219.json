The investigators will also assess the effect of intensive visual retraining on the residual visual system, processing of visual information and the use of such information in real-world situations following damage. This research is intended to improve our understanding of the consequences of permanent visual system damage in humans, of methods that can be used to reverse visual loss, and of brain mechanisms by which visual recovery is achieved."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vision Loss Partial","Vision; Loss, Both Eyes","Hemianopia Homonymous","Hemianopia","Quadrantanopia","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke - Occipital Infarction","Cortical Blindness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: Cortically Blind (CB) Subjects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cortically Blind subjects will be enrolled to perform a daily home visual training task.","interventionNames":["Device: Training in the Blind Field"]},{"label":"Normative Comparator: Control Subjects","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Healthy control subjects will be recruited to collect normative data by which to compare test results from CB subjects.
