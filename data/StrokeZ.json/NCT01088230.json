One of the challenges of recovery is muscle stiffness or excessive muscle tone that often limits exercise or therapy progress. Taking this into account, the investigators propose treating the wrist and forearm with a combination of a one-time Botox® injection and a 6-week robotic therapy protocol to maximize recovery.\n\nBotox® is a drug that is injected directly into a muscle to temporarily relax the muscle. Botox® is commonly used to decrease muscle tone in tight muscles in the stroke population. Robotics therapy provides highly repetitive mass practice with visual and haptic feedback.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to two groups. Group A will receive the Botox® injection and group B will receive a placebo saline injection. Both groups will receive the same robotics therapy protocol. Subjects and investigators will be blinded to group assignment. The investigators would like to know if there are trends between groups in a variety of outcome measures depending on what intervention they received. The investigators predict that the treatment group will have better results than the control group on the Fugl Meyer, our primary outcome measure. The investigators hope the results of this pilot study will guide development of a larger clinical trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["hemiparesis","robotics","stroke","Botox®","rehabilitation","wrist spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botox®","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"this group will receive an injection of botox in the wrist flexors and forearm pronators","interventionNames":["Other: Botox®"]},{"label":"Saline","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive an injection of saline solution in the same muscle groups as the treatment group (wrist flexors and pronators).","interventionNames":["Other: saline solution"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Botox®","description":"the treatment group will receive a one time injection of Botox® at the wrist flexors and pronators of the affected arm.
