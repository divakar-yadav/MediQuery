The pathomechanism of delirium is related to neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress. Search for readily available diagnostic marker that will aid clinicians in early identification of delirium is an on-going process. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and other derived white cell markers as early markers of delirium and outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Delirium","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["delirium","stroke","neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio","NLR","mortality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1001,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Delirious","description":"Patients were delirious if CAM-ICU was positive within 24 hours from admission due to acute ischemic stroke.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Delirium assessment."]},{"label":"Non-delirious","description":"Patients were delirious if CAM-ICU was negative within 24 hours from admission due to acute ischemic stroke.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Delirium assessment."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Delirium assessment.","description":"Full blood count analysis.","armGroupLabels":["Delirious","Non-delirious"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early-onset-delirium.","description":"Delirium within 24 hours from admission.","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality at 30 days.","description":"Mortality determined at follow-up on day 30 after acute ischemic stroke.","timeFrame":"30 days"},{"measure":"Mortality at 1 year.","description":"Mortality determined at follow-up at 1 year after acute ischemic stroke.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age \\>18 years)\n* acute ischemic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* hematology disorders\n* incomplete laboratory testing\n* no data regarding follow-up","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Consecutive adult patients (age \\>18 years) with acute ischemic stroke, admitted to a neurology department of a busy district general hospital in Poland between 30.06.2015 and 31.03.2018.
