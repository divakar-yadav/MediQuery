Early rehabilitation of stroke is very important. The purpose of our study was to evaluate, through clinical examination, whether there was any difference between patients who underwent early rehabilitation and those who underwent late rehabilitation in terms of improvements in motor and functional impairment after rehabilitation, and also to evaluate this difference objectively by analyzing white-matter pathways (corticospinal tracts) using DTI.","detailedDescription":"Methods: Twenty-eight (28) adults (12 women, 16 men, average age 58 years) with first-time stroke who met the study criteria were divided into two groups depending on the duration of their stroke at the time of their presentation to our facility. Group 1 consisted of patients who underwent rehabilitation program within the first 1-4 weeks after stroke, whereas Group 2 consisted of patients who underwent rehabilitation program within 5-8 weeks after stroke. Both groups were evaluated using the BRS, FMA scale, FAC and BI scales. For cranial imaging, DTI was obtained 1 day before and 1 day after treatment. FA and ADC values of corticospinal tracts were performed using DTI.\n\nIntervention: Patients were enrolled in a rehabilitation program, which was designed for a total of 4 weeks, with daily sessions lasting a total of 1 h on 5 days of a week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","diffusion tensor imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The clinician evaluating the patient and the radiologist evaluating the MRI were blinded to the groups.","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group 1","type":"OTHER","description":"Group 1:Early rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Demonstration the Importance of Early Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data"]},{"label":"group 2","type":"OTHER","description":"Group 2:Late rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Demonstration the Importance of Early Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Demonstration the Importance of Early Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data","description":"Twenty-eight stroke patients aged 36-72 years admitted to the our Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinics were included in this prospective study.
