Hypothermia seems promising also in other acute hypoxic-ischemic or in brain swelling associated cerebrovascular disease. The narrow-time-frame is a major issue (\"time is brain\"). To provide immediate cooling without delay, easy to use, mobile and effective methods are needed. Cold infusions (4 °C) are an accepted standard worldwide. EMCOOLS Brain.Pad (Emergency Medical Cooling Systems AG, Wien, Austria) is a new non-invasive surface cooling system. A comparison of these two induction methods has never been done before. Neither was the effect of the EMCOOLS Brain.Pad on brain-temperature measured. For the first time iCOOL 3 compares feasibility, safety and efficacy of the two methods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["hypothermia","induction of hypothermia","cold infusion","local neck cooling","external cooling","surface cooling","non invasive cooling","stroke","intracranial hemorrhage","cerebrovascular disease","neuro intensive care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cold infusions","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Infusion of 1L cold crystalloid solution (4°C) over 15 minutes","interventionNames":["Drug: Cold crystalloid infusions, 0.9%NaCl or Ringer's"]},{"label":"EMCOOLS Brain.Pad","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Passive external neck cooling with 1 EMCOOLS Brain.Pad (Emergency Medical Cooling Systems AG, Wien, Austria)","interventionNames":["Device: EMCOOLS Brain.Pad"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cold crystalloid infusions, 0.9%NaCl or Ringer's","description":"Infusion of max. 1L cold crystalloid solution (4°C) over 15 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Cold infusions"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"EMCOOLS Brain.Pad","description":"Passive external neck cooling with 1 EMCOOLS Brain.Pad","armGroupLabels":["EMCOOLS Brain.Pad"],"otherNames":["Emergency Medical Cooling Systems AG, Wien, Austria"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain temperature","description":"Primary endpoint: Change of brain temperature during one hour after start of cooling.
