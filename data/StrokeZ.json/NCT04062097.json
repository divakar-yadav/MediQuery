Routine data will be collected during hospitalization. Patients aged 18 years or older under effective therapy with dabigatran and symptomatic intracranial bleeding confirmed by cerebral imaging and treated with idarucizumab will be compared to patients under effective treatment with VKA at the time of onset of the intracranial bleeding. Ninety-five dabigatran patients who provided written informed consent for data transmission will be included. As control group retrospective and anonymized data of 285 VKA patients patients under VKA treatment and admitted to RIC-ICH study centers will be used. For each patient receiving idarucizumab, three patients with intracranial hemorrhage under effective treatment with VKA, will be included (retrospective) in the study. In addition, data of VKA patients will be transferred from the RASUNOA-PRIME and the \"Erlanger Hirnblutungs-Register\"."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["intracranial/intracerebral bleeding","stroke","transient ischemic attack (TIA)","myocardial infarction","anticoagulation","dabigatran","idarucizumab","vitamin-k antagonists"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"dabigatran-group","description":"Patients with the anticoagulating therapy dabigatran and onset of clinically symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, that is treated with idarucizumab.","interventionNames":["Drug: Dabigatran Etexilate Oral Capsule [Pradaxa]","Drug: Idarucizumab 2.5 GM/50 ML Intravenous Solution [PRAXBIND]"]},{"label":"VKA-group","description":"Patients under effective treatment with VKA and with intracranial hemorrhage.","interventionNames":["Drug: Vitamin K antagonist"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dabigatran Etexilate Oral Capsule [Pradaxa]","description":"Dabigatran is the most frequently used direct thrombin inhibitor in secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.","armGroupLabels":["dabigatran-group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Idarucizumab 2.5 GM/50 ML Intravenous Solution [PRAXBIND]","description":"Idarucizumab is the current standard therapy in patients with intracranial bleeding under anticoagulation with dabigatran.","armGroupLabels":["dabigatran-group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin K antagonist","description":"This drug group includes the active substances phenprocoumon and warfarin.","armGroupLabels":["VKA-group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intra-hospital mortality rate","description":"Intra-hospital mortality rate","timeFrame":"From study inclusion until hospital discharge or 30 days after index event, whichever came first."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","description":"Change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of ≥4 pts compared to initial NIHSS or worsening of NIHSS level of consciousness ≥1 point or increase of the volume of the intracranial bleeding or new intraventricular bleeding or death.
