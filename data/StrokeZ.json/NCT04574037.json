To date, an algorithm (decision tree) proposed by C. Stinear's team named PREP2 is the best predictive tool with 75% of patients well classified at 3 months. It predicts the functional recovery of the upper limb after stroke 3 months before the episode by categorizing recovery as \"excellent\", \"good\", \"limited\" as well as \"minor\" (poor). With two data (SAFE score, age) or three (SAFE score, Motor evoked potential, NIHSS), the prediction is effective three times out of 4. In the study the team is proposing \"PREP-UCV\", it would like to validate this algorithm as it is with patients in the active file who are victims of stroke. The expected accuracy is 75% or more. As a secondary objective, the team would like to confirm that it find the same algorithm starting from the initial data from PREP 2 (side of the stroke, type of stroke (ischemic and / or hemorrhagic), involvement of the corticospinal tract on MRI, sex at birth ) as well as two other factors which are also very important: cognitive status (dysexecutive / aphasia / neglect), as well as the neutrophils on lymphocytes ratio.","detailedDescription":"Retrospective cohort of stroke patients with a upper limb deficit.Clinical scores such as SAFE score, NIHSS; demographic data such as age and electrophysiological data (such as the absence/presence of Motor evoked potential) will determine the predictive functional outcome of the upper limb deficit according to the PREP2 algorithm. The accuracy of this prediction will be verified according to the actual state of the patient at 3-6 months. Second, another algorithm will be built taking in account cognitive deficits and biological data to determine if the accuracy is higher. All data will be acquired during the clinical routine work-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Limb Motor Deficit"],"keywords":["stroke","motor","prediction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"follow up of stroke patients with a upper limb deficit","description":"Usual follow up of stroke patients with a upper limb deficit","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical scores such as SAFE score, NIHSS; demographic data such as age and electrophysiological data (such as the absence/presence of Motor evoked potential)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical scores such as SAFE score, NIHSS; demographic data such as age and electrophysiological data (such as the absence/presence of Motor evoked potential)","description":"Clinical scores such as SAFE score, NIHSS; demographic data such as age and electrophysiological data (such as the absence/presence of Motor evoked potential) will determine the predictive functional outcome of the upper limb deficit according to the PREP2 algorithm.","armGroupLabels":["follow up of stroke patients with a upper limb deficit"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accuracy of classification with the PREP2 decision tree","description":"Proportion of patients well classified in their group of recovery","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n* age ≥ 18 y-o,\n* admitted in the Pitié-Salpêtrière stroke unit,\n* stroke with a upper limb motor deficit,\n* agree to participate;\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* contra-indication to MRI or TMS,\n* patients under legal guardianship ,\n* patients without healthcare insurance","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients with upper limb motor deficits","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Charlotte ROSSO, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"1 42 16 21 03","phoneExt":"+33","email":"charlotte.rosso@aphp.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service des Urgences Cérébro-Vasculaires, Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Paris","zip":"75013","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Charlotte Rosso, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01 42 16 21 03/18 54","phoneExt":"+33","email":"charlotte.rosso@aphp.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
