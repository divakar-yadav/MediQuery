The composition of gut microbiota may affect stroke prognosis, including focal neurological deficits, cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression, and fatigue. In this study, 16s RNA was used to detect the composition and diversity of intestinal flora, and flow cytometry and mass spectrometry were used to detect intestinal flora-related metabolites in plasma. The clinical data of patients were collected, including age, gender, and medical history, NIHSS, mRS, MMSE, Patient Health Questionnaire-9（PHQ9）, Social Support Rating Scale（SSRS）, laboratory and radiology results. The neurological recovery of the patients was assessed after 3 and 6 months, and the presence or absence of post-stroke depression（PSD） and post-stroke fatigue（PSF） was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale（FSS） and the Multidimensional Fatigue Scale（MFS）. To evaluate the relationship between gut microbiota and its metabolites and stroke prognosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Gut flora","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Faecal samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PSD","description":"Depressed as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Scale 3 months after stroke"},{"label":"Non PSD","description":"Nondepressed as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Scale 3 months after stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The PSD Assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) Score","description":"Mild depression（HAMD-17 Score≥7，\\<17）, moderate depression（HAMD-17 Score≥17，\\<24）, major depression（HAMD-17 Score≥24）","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"The PSD Assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) Score","description":"Mild depression（HAMD-17 Score≥7，\\<17）, moderate depression（HAMD-17 Score≥17，\\<24）, major depression（HAMD-17 Score≥24）","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"The PSF Assessed by Fatigue Severity Scale（FSS）","description":"Fatigue（≥36）","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"The PSF Assessed by Fatigue Severity Scale（FSS）","description":"Fatigue（FSS Score ≥36）","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Functional Independence Assessed by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS）score","description":"MRS score range from 0 to 6.
