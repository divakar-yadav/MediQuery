Secondly, SMAART II seeks to develop an implementation strategy for routine integration and policy adoption of this polypill for post-stroke cardiovascular risk reduction in an under-resourced system burdened by suboptimal care and outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Medication Adherence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":680,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients allocated to the experimental arm will receive Two (2) (Polycap ®) taken orally once a day.
