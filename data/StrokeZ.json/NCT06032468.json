Studies of post-stroke patients have revealed some benefits of telerehabilitation, such as the ability for patients to self-record pain, mood and activity. Telerehabilitation has comparable efficacy to face-to-face rehabilitation for the recovery of some abilities, such as motor function, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and independence; it is less effective, however, for the recovery of balance control. Published reviews concerning, in particular, neurological/neurodegenerative diseases show that telerehabilitation systems are effective in maintaining and/or improving some motor aspects, such as balance and gait, and non-motor aspects, such as mood and quality of life; they also increase patient satisfaction, so in the long term they appear to be beneficial, convenient and satisfying for patients and operators.\n\nARC Intellicare is a device undergoing certification as a Class I Medical Device (DM), already clinically tested during two uncontrolled clinical feasibility studies: ARCANGEL study (post-stroke, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03787433) and RICOMINCIARE study (post-COVID19 and Parkinson's disease, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05074771)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Multiple
