The overall benefit of alteplase is substantial. However, there is considerable room for improvement as 2/3 of patients with large clots may not achieve reopening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients remain severely disabled or die.\n\nTenecteplase, a modified tissue plasminogen activator, has been shown to be a more efficient and safer thrombolytic drug than alteplase in pre-clinical studies. Tenecteplase has replaced alteplase as thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction and may also be the drug of choice in ischemic stroke.\n\nTenecteplase and alteplase had a similar safety profile in the NOR-TEST trial and there were no differences in efficacy between the two treatment groups. However, a majority of patients had mild stroke which may be associated with a natural favorable prognosis.\n\nIn spite of these neutral results, tenecteplase has the potential to replace alteplase as the drug of choice, based on a better pharmacological profile and a simpler practical administration. There is, however, need for a higher number of patients to prove the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase.\n\nHypothesis: Tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg is non-inferior compared with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg.","detailedDescription":"Objectives: To compare efficacy and safety of tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg (single bolus) vs. alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus + 90% infusion/60 minutes) a) within 4½ hours after symptom onset; b) within 4½ hours after awakening with stroke symptoms, and c) as bridging therapy within 4½ hours before thrombectomy.\n\nStudy design: NOR-TEST-2 is a multi-centre PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint) trial, designed to establish non-inferiority of tenecteplase as compared with alteplase for consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated within 4½ hours after symptom onset. Randomisation tenecteplase:alteplase is 1:1.\n\nEndpoints: Primary endpoint is functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at 90 days (efficacy). Secondary endpoints include rates of cerebral hemorrhages on CT/MR at 24-48 hours and mortality (safety).\n\nPatient recruitment: All patients admitted to hospital with acute ischaemic stroke eligible for standard iv thrombolysis with alteplase and with pre-stroke mRS\\<3 and NIHSS score of \\>5 on admission are potentially eligible for NOR-TEST-2. Based on power calculations from NOR-TEST, NOR-TEST 2 aims at including 1036 patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Tenecteplase","Thrombolysis","Alteplase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, controlled multicenter study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":201,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Tenecteplase","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Alteplase","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Alteplase","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"0.4 mg/kg single bolus intravenously","armGroupLabels":["Tenecteplase"],"otherNames":["Metalyse"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase","description":"0.9 mg/kg as 10% bolus + 90% infusion/60 minutes intravenously","armGroupLabels":["Alteplase"],"otherNames":["Actilyse"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with favorable functional outcome","description":"Modified Rankin Scale 0-1 (favorable= 0-1, unfavorable 2-6)","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage","description":"Proportion of patients with haemorrhagic infarct/haematoma as defined by CT or MRI","timeFrame":"24-48 hours"},{"measure":"Any cerebral haemorrhage","description":"Proportion of patients haemorrhagic infarct/haematoma as defined by CT or MRI","timeFrame":"24-48 hours"},{"measure":"Major neurological improvement","description":"Proportion of patients \\>3 Points improvement by NIHSS score or NIHSS score 0 (NIHSS score range is 0-42)","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Functional handicap","description":"Ordinal shift analysis of modified Rankin scale (0-6)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Mortality","description":"Proportion of patients who died","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"General inclusion criteria\n\n* 18 years or older\n* Ischaemic stroke with clinical symptoms corresponding to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS) of \\>5.
