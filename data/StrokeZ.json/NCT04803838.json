Approximately 215 patients will be included in this study where collected samples will be analyzed and levels of metabolites quantified. These metabolite levels will be compared to a control group of 70 healthy controls without carotid atherosclerosis (verified by ultrasound), cardiovascular outcome defined as stroke/TIA or vascular death, as well as traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke (diabetes, hypertension, smoking and coronary artery disease).\n\nStudy 2: (Comparative cross-sectional study) The aim of this study is to asses if microbiota and microbiota metabolite Levels are Associated With certain types of diet, in particular Rich in red meat and egg yalk.\n\nIn this study, 215 patients with ultrasound verified carotid atherosclerosis with or without symptoms of TIA/stroke will be compared to 70 controls. Dietary intake and food habits will be recorded using the SmartDiet questionnaire developed by 'Lipidklinikken Rikshospitalet'. Feces, saliva and blood will be collected analyzed for microbiota and metabolites. Antroprometrics, blood pressure and pulse will be recorded.\n\nIn patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and immunohistochemical analysis will be done.\n\nStudy 3: (Comparative cross-sectional study) The aim of this study is to evaluate correlation between the microbiota and microbiota metabolite Levels With other inflammatory markers in blood, as well as known risk factors for stroke and inflammation on imaging modalities (ultrasound, 3-T MRI and PET/CT) .\n\nIn this study, 215 patients with ultrasound verified carotid atherosclerosis with or without symptoms of TIA/stroke will be compared to 70 controls.\n\nPatients will undergo investigations with carotid ultrasound, carotid and cerebral MR imaging, blood tests including inflammatory biomarkers. A sub-group of patients will in addition undergo PET/CT imaging of carotid arteries.\n\nStudy 4: (Follow up study) The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of microbiota and microbiota metabolites to predict ischemic stroke in patient With carotid stenosis.\n\nPatients in study 2 and 3 will be followed up after 2 years with repetition of investigations. Findings with serum levels of microbiota metabolites, traditional risk factors and imaging will be correlated to clinical and radiological ischemic events and plaque progression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
