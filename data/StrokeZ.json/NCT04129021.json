However, current clinical imaging systems are limited in resolution, speed, or access to certain structures of the eye.\n\nThe use of a high-resolution imaging system improves the resolution of ophthalmoscopes by several orders of magnitude, allowing the visualization of many microstructures of the eye: photoreceptors, vessels, nerve bundles in the retina, cells and nerves in the cornea.\n\nThe use of a high-speed acquisition imaging system makes it possible to detect functional measurements such as the speed of blood flow. The combination of data from multiple imaging systems to obtain multimodal information is of great importance for improving the understanding of structural changes in the eye during a disease.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to observe structures that are not detectable with routinely used systems.","detailedDescription":"The goal of the project is the capture and analysis of images with the IMA-MODE systems, in order to evaluate the performance of these systems compared to the existing clinical imaging devices used at the National Hospital of Ophthalmology.\n\nThis project should identify the best techniques to image the eye, and select the most promising techniques to evolve towards a possible development of a medical device."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinitis Pigmentosa","Maculopathy, Age Related","Macular Dystrophy","Macular Edema","Retinal Detachment","Retinal Degeneration","Glaucoma","Vascular Inflammation","Hypertension","Stroke","Diabetes","Corneal Dystrophy","Keratoconus","Dry Eye","Trauma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-resolution retinal imaging through adaptive optics","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"High-resolution retinal imaging through adaptive optics, full field OCT and holographic systems","interventionNames":["Device: High-resolution retinal imaging through adaptive optics","Device: High-resolution retinal imaging through holographic systems"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High-resolution retinal imaging through adaptive optics","description":"The protocol consists of performing retinal imaging using full-field optical coherence tomography.
