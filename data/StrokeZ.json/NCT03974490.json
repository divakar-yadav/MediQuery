Reviews argue that more randomized controlled trials with a control group are needed. Main objective: Evaluate the effect of a rhythmic auditory stimulation on the quality of balance and gait parameters in people with stroke. Methodology: quasi-experimental study. The study has been approved by the hospital ethics committee.","detailedDescription":"A rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) intervention may be beneficial in order to improve the parameters of the post-stroke movement: increase of the speed of the walk, improvement in the width of the step with the affected side, improvement of the walking index dynamics (Dynamic Gait Index), improvement in cadence and improvement in the static balance.\n\nCurrent systematic reviews argue that more randomized controlled trials with a control group are needed.\n\nMain objective: To evaluate the effect of a rhythmic auditory stimulation on the quality of progress and balance in people with stroke.\n\nMethodology: experimental group will be done between 2019 and 2020 and historical control group of the years 2017 and 2018. Experimental group will do 3 sessions in a week of RAS, and daily 2 hours of physiotherapy except of Sundays. Control group received 2 hours daily of physiotherapy, except Sundays.\n\nThe study has been approved by the hospital ethics committee."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic","Gait Disorders, Neurologic"],"keywords":["rhythm","musicotherapy","balance","gait","stroke","physiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 hours from Monday to Saturday, conventional physiotherapy: strengthening, stretching, dual task training.\n\n3 Times a week, intervention: Start with global body warming, 15 minutes, following the rhythm marked by the metronome.
