During feeding, the patient should maintain a semi-reclining or sitting position with mouth opened, and the tube was inserted slowly and smoothly into the upper part of the esophagus by medical staffs while the appropriate depth of intubation was checked with the calibration markings on the tube wall. The distance from the incisors to the head part of the tube should be between 22-25 cm. However, the specific depth should be evaluated based on patients' feedback and adjusted accordingly. After insertion, the tail part of the tube should be put into a container full of water and the absence of continuous bubbles indicated a successful intubation. Then, the feeding was to be conducted three times per day with 50 ml per minute and 400-600ml for each feeding.","armGroupLabels":["The experimental group","The placebo group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial direct current stimulation","description":"In this study, transcranial direct current stimulation is performed using a battery-powered constant current stimulator. This device delivers the current through two electrodes immersed in saline solution. Specifically, a 50mm\\*50mm anodal electrode pad is placed at the center of the healthy side swallowing sensory-motor cortex of the patient. According to the positioning method of the international 10-20 electrode system, the swallowing sensory-motor cortex of the left brain is located at the midpoint between C3 and T3, while that of the right brain is located at the midpoint between C4 and T4. The cathode is placed on the opposite shoulder, using a current of 1mA, once a day, for 20 minutes each time, and 5 days a week. The instruments used for placebo patients will not have any actual effect.","armGroupLabels":["The experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Penetration Aspiration Scale","description":"Penetration-Aspiration Scale is used to measure swallowing safety, which is also the primary outcome of this study. Before and after treatment, patients are required to undergo a swallow study to complete the assessment. This scale evaluates the patient's swallowing function level and aspiration risk by assessing leakage and aspiration during the patient's swallowing process. The results are divided into eight levels, with higher levels indicating poorer swallowing function and lower swallowing safety.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Oral Intake Scale","description":"During Dysphagia-Functional Oral Intake Scale assessment, evaluators engage in communication with the patient, conduct observations, and make records to assess the patient's oral intake ability. The Functional Oral Intake Scale assessment form includes seven levels of scoring, ranging from level 1 to level 7, indicating a progressive improvement in the patient's oral intake ability. In general, the result below level 6 indicates unsafe for oral intake while level 6 and above indicates that eating via mouth can be safely conducted.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 15"},{"measure":"Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire","description":"The Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QOL) is used to evaluate the impact of swallowing function on patients' quality of life.
