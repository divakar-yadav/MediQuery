Fluid therapy regimes for patients with high BMI, especially with focus on preoperative management, are rare and not in consensus.The aim of this study was to evaluate preoperative effects of a standardized, ideal body weight (IBW) based volume-challenge on hemodynamics, stroke volume and level of venous return to the heart.","detailedDescription":"34 morbidly obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery underwent a preoperative three-week preparation by rapid-weight-loss-diet (RWL) to be accepted for bariatric surgery. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in the awake state before and after volume-challenge (VC) based on 6ml colloids /kg IBW. Feasibility of standardized VC was evaluated by TTE. Dynamic and non-dynamic echocardiographic indices for VC were studied.\n\nMain outcome measures: Volume-responsiveness and level of venous return before and after volume-challenge were assessed by TTE. An increase of stroke volume ≥ 13% was considered as a volume-responder."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anomaly; Venous Return"],"keywords":["morbidly obese patients,","preoperative volume-challenge,","transthoracic echocardiography,","TTE,","rapid weight loss,","venous return,","bariatric surgery,","left ventricular outflow tract,","stroke volume,","diastolic function,","hypervolemia,","hypovolemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"preoperative venous return optimizing","description":"Morbidly obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery","interventionNames":["Other: preoperative venous return optimizing"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"preoperative venous return optimizing","description":"Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in the awake state before and after volume challenge based on 6ml colloids /kg ideal body weight.","armGroupLabels":["preoperative venous return optimizing"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"level of venous return","timeFrame":"0,1 hour"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Volume-responsiveness","timeFrame":"0,1 hour"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of feasibility of dynamic and non-dynamic echocardiographic indices for volume challenge","timeFrame":"1 hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* enrolled for bariatric surgery\n* BMI ≥ 40 or ≥ 35kg/m2 with co-morbidities\n* preoperative three-weeks preparation by rapid-weight-loss-diet and weight loss\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* untreated significant hypertension\n* unstable angina pectoris\n* significant valve regurgitation or stenosis\n* known severe pulmonary disease","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Morbidly obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery in Northern part of Sweden; Norrbotten county council.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Tomi P Pösö, MD","affiliation":"Norrbotten county council, Umeå University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sunderby county hospital","city":"Lulea","state":"Norrbotten","zip":"97180","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":65.58415,"lon":22.15465}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009767","term":"Obesity, Morbid"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009765","term":"Obesity"},{"id":"D000050177","term":"Overweight"},{"id":"D000044343","term":"Overnutrition"},{"id":"D000009748","term":"Nutrition Disorders"},{"id":"D000001835","term":"Body Weight"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M12391","name":"Obesity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4804","name":"Body Weight","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12","name":"Congenital Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17792","name":"Weight Loss","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22324","name":"Hypovolemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12392","name":"Obesity, Morbid","asFound":"Morbid Obesity","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M25876","name":"Overweight","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M24997","name":"Overnutrition","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12374","name":"Nutrition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"}]}},"hasResults":false}
