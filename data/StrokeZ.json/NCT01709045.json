A vulnerable plaque is considered to have a large lipid rich necrotic core (LRNC), a thin fibrous cap, the presence of inflammatory cells, intraplaque haemorrhage and/or neovascularisation (vasa vasorum). The investigators aim to validate imaging of plaque vulnerability with histology. Previous studies have evaluated the use of imaging to assess carotid plaque vulnerability, mostly showing a good correlation between imaging and histology and/or clinical characteristics. However, they have focused on single modalities, (magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\], multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), ultrasonography (US) or transcranial Doppler (TCD), and have used relatively small cohorts\n\nThe primary goal of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between neovascularisation in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque as observed with 3.0 Tesla dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and histology. Moreover, the investigators aim to investigate the correlation between the volume of the LRNC as determined by dual-energy CT and histology.\n\nSecondly, the investigators will investigate the correlation between the volume of the LRNC, the fibrous cap status and the volume of the calcifications determined by MRI versus histology, the correlation between number of microembolisms and fibrous cap status and the correlation between the deformation pattern seen with ultrasound and the volume of the LRNC.\n\nThe imaging parameters showing good correlation with plaque vulnerability characteristics can be used for further analysis in assessing the vulnerable plaque"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Plaque, Atherosclerotic"],"keywords":["Endarterectomy, Carotid","Carotid Arteries"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Carotid plaque removed during carotid endarterectomy"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients scheduled for CEA","description":"All patients who are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA)","interventionNames":["Other: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","Radiation: Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT)","Other: Ultrasound","Other: Transcranial doppler"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","description":"Multi-sequence MR protocol","armGroupLabels":["Patients scheduled for CEA"],"otherNames":["3.0 T Philips Achieva"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT)","armGroupLabels":["Patients scheduled for CEA"],"otherNames":["Siemens Flash"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ultrasound","armGroupLabels":["Patients scheduled for CEA"],"otherNames":["Philips IU22"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Transcranial doppler","armGroupLabels":["Patients scheduled for CEA"],"otherNames":["Hemodynamics AG"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ktrans on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI","description":"The correlation between neovascularisation in carotid atherosclerotic plaque as assessed by dynamic 3.0 Tesla MRI and microvasculature as assessed by histology.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Lipid-rich necrotic core on dual-energy CT","description":"The correlation between the size of lipid-rich-necrotic-core in dual-energy CT and histology.","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"deformation pattern on ultrasound","description":"The correlation between deformation pattern at echo and plaque composition (volume of LRNC) at histology.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"number of recorded micro embolic signals (MES)","description":"The relation between number of recorded MES and fibrous cap status at histology.","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Volume of LRNC and calcifications and fibrous cap status on MRI","description":"The correlation between volume of LRNC, fibrous cap status and volume of calcifications in carotid atherosclerotic plaques visualised by MRI and the same features as determined at histology.","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a carotid artery stenosis, who are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy\n* Age 18 years or older (no maximum age)\n* Informed consent by signing informed consent form regarding this study\n* Inclusion criteria for carotid endarterectomy\n\n  1.
