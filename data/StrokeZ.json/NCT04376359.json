Oral opportunistic pathogens have been reported to be associated with the incidence of pneumonia among non-stroke immunocompromised subjects. Preliminary studies found that patients with stroke had higher carriage rates of oral opportunistic pathogens than healthy subjects. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that pneumonia complicating stroke is associated with oral opportunistic pathogens, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy may reduce the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke by increasing the flow of saliva, which can affect the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic pathogens. In order to prove this, investigators need to (1) firstly conduct a randomized controlled trial to confirm whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy is able to reduce the levels of plaque, and the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke at clinical level; (2) secondly employ metagenomics analysis to compare oral rinse samples and respiratory samples, and to identify pneumonia-associated \"oral opportunistic pathogens group\"; (3) finally elucidate how hyperbaric oxygen therapy influences the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic pathogens. This proposed study will provide evidence for the integration of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as part of interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy","Stroke","Pneumonia"],"keywords":["Oral opportunistic pathogens","Pneumonia complicating stroke","Metagenome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":168,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hyperbaric oxygen therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with stroke will receive the hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for 40 times, which were completed on 40 business days over a 2-month period and each session lasted 90 minutes at 100% oxygen concentration and 2 atmospheres.","interventionNames":["Procedure: hyperbaric oxygen therapy"]},{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Stroke patients were not treated with HBOT except for the same routine treatment as the experimental group."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"hyperbaric oxygen therapy","description":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the patient put in airtight oxygen tank, by increasing the air pressure in the environment (1.5 to 3.0) under atmospheric pressure, to give 100% oxygen, the patient treatment time is approximately 60 minutes to 120 minutes in this way, can achieve the purpose of greatly increase the oxygen partial pressure in the organization, so as to achieve reverse brain edema, reduce lipid peroxidation, inhibiting leukocyte hyperactivity, rebuild the blood brain barrier.","armGroupLabels":["hyperbaric oxygen therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of pneumonia","description":"To calculate and compare the incidence of pneumonia between interventional group and control group, to identify whether the intervention approach could reduce the incidence.","timeFrame":"2 months"},{"measure":"Metagenomics","description":"To analyze and compare the effect of intervention on the diversity of bacteria in saliva samples and lower respiratory sputum samples.","timeFrame":"2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Short Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12)","description":"The concise health status scale (SF-12) IS used to assess the systemic health-related quality of life in stroke patients.
