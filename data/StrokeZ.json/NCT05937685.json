The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do people in the REACH BP program have lower blood pressure at 12 months compared to those getting usual care?\n* Do people in the REACH BP program have better Life's Essential 8 scores and patient experience compared to those getting usual care?","detailedDescription":"Hypertension is the leading contributor to preventable death and a major risk factor for recurrent cardiovascular events. To enhance BP control after stroke or myocardial infarction (MI), multilevel interventions are needed that incorporate health system, patient, and community level factors.\n\nBP-REACH aims to test the impact of an intervention on systolic blood pressure (SBP) for individuals with a history of stroke or MI in a randomized controlled trial in the Los Angeles Department of Health Services public healthcare system. The primary outcome will be change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 12 months.\n\nHypothesis: Patients randomized to the intervention will achieve \\>2.4 mm Hg greater reduction in SBP at 1 year versus those randomized to usual care.\n\nThe study population will include participants from the inpatient and outpatient settings in Los Angeles County Department of Health Services health centers. The participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to usual care or intervention, stratified by site, language and cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke). Outcomes will be collected from all participants at Baseline, 3 month and 12 month timepoints. The primary outcome is SBP.\n\nParticipants randomized to the intervention arm will receive additional a home blood pressure monitor, monthly phone calls from a health coach, and medication initiation and titration by a clinical pharmacist. The pharmacist will follow Los Angeles County Department of Health Services expected practices, which align with the ACC/AHA guidelines for blood pressure control and AHA guidelines for Secondary Stroke Prevention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction","Hypertension","Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","myocardial infarction","hypertension","self-management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants receive the usual care received by patients of the medical center"},{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants follow the intervention protocol, including receiving educational materials, a home blood pressure monitor, coaching calls from BP REACH coaches and medication management from a pharmacist.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: BP REACH Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"BP REACH Intervention","description":"Educational materials, written and digital.
