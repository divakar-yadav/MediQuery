Transcranial Magnetic Imaging (TMS) will be used to compare the difference in the brain reorganization of each client before and after the intervention to identify which technique is more effective in changing brain function. Central Hypothesis: Stroke subjects with motor deficit receiving occupation-based interventions will demonstrate improved motor function greater to that of the subjects receiving m-CIT interventions. Sixteen participants with chronic stroke will be recruited for the study over the age 21. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two therapy groups and will receive 55 minutes of therapy 2 times per week for 4 weeks for a total of 8 sessions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["motor recovery","human","occupation-based practice","motor training","transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Occupation-based practice","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Occupation-based intervention (OBP) is a form of activity-based therapy consisting of client-directed occupations that match client-identified goals.

No physical constraint of the less-affected UE will be applied, but training compelled highly repetitive use of the more-affected upper extremity.
