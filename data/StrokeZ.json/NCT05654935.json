Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid atherosclerotic plaque detection have been powerful screening tools for identifying patients at risk for cardiovascular events; including myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and stroke. The need for trained sonographers by the patient side to perform quality ultrasound studies has limited the accessibility to this imaging tool, both in terms of location and time of day. Robotic arms controlled remotely over the internet, by trained sonographers, can potentially provide easier and more ubiquitous access to ultrasonography in and outside traditional medical facilities, including remote villages in underdeveloped countries, disaster areas, battle zones, etc. In this proposal, the investigators will demonstrate the feasibility and noninferiority of telerobotic ultrasonography as compared to traditional manual acquisition in performing a limited carotid Duplex examination and in carotid plaque detection.\n\nHYPOTHESIS:\n\nTelerobotic ultrasound performed by an experienced sonographer over the Internet produces diagnostic images with quality similar to manual conventional imaging.\n\nAIMS:\n\n1. Telerobotic ultrasonography produces diagnostic images of the carotid arteries at a rate that is non-inferior to those obtained using standard manual acquisition.\n2. Telerobotic ultrasonography can detect carotid atherosclerotic plaques at a rate that is non-inferior to the gold standard of manual acquisition.\n\nIMPLICATIONS:\n\nRealizing our study aims could mark a new era in ultrasonography. There are wide applications for telerobotic carotid ultrasonography in atherosclerosis screening. Furthermore, establishing the noninferiority of telerobotic carotid ultrasonography acquisition will provide a rationale for further studies in telerobotic ultrasonography, including echocardiography. This in turn has even wider clinical applications such as emergency studies in hospitals during weekends and after-hours. In addition, this could pave the way for use in disaster areas and battle zones where expert sonographers may not be available on-site."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Disease","Atherosclerosis","Atheromatous Plaques","Arteriosclerosis","Vascular Disease","Arterial Occlusive Diseases","Stroke","Cardiac Death","Myocardial Infarction","Coronary Artery Disease","Cardiovascular Disease","Coronary Disease","Coronary Arteriosclerosis","Carotid Arteriosclerosis","Myocardial Ischemia","Heart Diseases","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Peripheral Vascular Disease","Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort A","description":"Includes 26 healthy volunteers \\>18 years of age without history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, coronary artery disease (prior myocardial infarction, typical angina, prior percutaneous coronary revascularization, and prior coronary bypass graft surgery), and peripheral arterial disease (claudication, peripheral arterial revascularization stenting of bypass surgery).
