After the randomization, subjects of both groups will have follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months and then every 12 months until 24 months after the last patient recruitment.

There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Brain computed tomography or MRI may help diagnose stroke.","timeFrame":"24 months after the date of randomization."},{"measure":"Number of participants with systemic embolism","description":"An embolism is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing piece of material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus is usually a blood clot (thrombus). An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel.\n\nAn embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism.\n\nAn embolism is usually a pathological event, i.e., accompanying illness or injury. Sometimes it is created intentionally for a therapeutic reason, such as to stop bleeding or to kill a cancerous tumor by stopping its blood supply.\n\nEmbolism can be classified as to where it enters the circulation either in arteries or in veins. Arterial embolism are those that follow and, if not dissolved on the way, lodge in a more distal part of the systemic circulation.","timeFrame":"24 months after the date of randomization."},{"measure":"Number of participants with cardiovascular/unexplained death","description":"Cardiovascular deaths refer to deaths due to heart dysfunction, injury of cardiac structure, coronary artery diseases and lethal arrhythmias or sudden death that cannot be explain. Cardiovascular deaths can be diagnosed with clinical symptoms or from the results of diagnostic examinations.","timeFrame":"24 months after the date of randomization."},{"measure":"Number of participants with major bleedings","description":"Major bleedings refer to the heavy bleedings of the mains organs of the body, usually include intracranial bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding et al.. Brain computed tomography and gastrointestinal endoscope are the common approaches for diagnosing major bleedings.","timeFrame":"24 months after the date of randomization."},{"measure":"Number of participants with acute coronary syndrome","description":"Acute coronary syndrome is a syndrome (set of signs and symptoms) due to decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries such that part of the heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, crushing, central and associated with nausea and sweating. Many people with acute coronary syndromes present with symptoms other than chest pain, particularly, women, older patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome is commonly associated with three clinical manifestations, named according to the appearance of the electrocardiogram (ECG): ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or unstable angina (38%). There can be some variation as to which forms of myocardial infarction (MI) are classified under acute coronary syndrome.","timeFrame":"24 months after the date of randomization."},{"measure":"Number of participants with coronary or periphery artery disease requiring revascularization","description":"Conronary or periphery artery diseases, regardless stable or not, need revascularization by stent which require long-term aspirin therapy","timeFrame":"24 months after the date of randomization."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with device-related thrombus","description":"This refers to the thrombus that is related to the implantation of the device for left atrial appendage closure.
