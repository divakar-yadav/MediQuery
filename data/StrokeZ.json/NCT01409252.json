Research assistant then telephoned the survivors for neurological and cognitive status.","detailedDescription":"Death at one year for intracerebral hemorrhage varies by location, with 42% for cerebellar in one series. Of patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage in the United States during 2002, only 20% are expected to be functionally independently at 6 months. Although case series established the value of selected timely hematoma evacuation, long term clinical outcome, especially on cognition, is not well described in the literature. With these in mind, we carried out this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","intracerebral hemorrhage","surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":191,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hemorrhagic stroke patients"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"Cross-sectional at 2-12 years after ictus"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel Index","description":"Basic Activity of Daily Living","timeFrame":"Cross-sectional at 2-12 years post-ictus"},{"measure":"Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status","timeFrame":"Cross-sectional at 2-12 years post-ictus"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All hemorrhagic stroke patients with neurosurgical operations performed between 1999 and 2008.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage as the dominant etiology\n* uncommunicable patients\n* nonsurvivors","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with neurosurgical operations","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"George Wong, MD(CUHK) FRCSEd(SN)","affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","city":"Hong Kong","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":22.39407,"lon":114.13737}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083302","term":"Hemorrhagic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9246","name":"Hemorrhage","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5482","name":"Cerebral Hemorrhage","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2405","name":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","asFound":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
