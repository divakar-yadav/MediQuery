Importantly, over 25% of ischaemic stroke sufferers have previously had a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), which presents the biggest concern for TIA patients. There are no measures which reliably identify TIA patients most likely to suffer a stroke. Novel biomarkers for predicting stroke are key to addressing this problem. The PREDICT-EV study aims to screen 300 TIA patients and follow them over 12-months. The investigators will determine if a novel biomarker we've identified to increase thrombotic risk (endothelial derived extracellular vesicles) and the resulting increased prothrombin time is associated with patients at highest risk of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Transient Ischemic Attack","Coagulation Disorder"],"keywords":["Stroke Risk","Transient Ischemic Attack","Extracellular Vesicles","Pro-Thrombotic Risk"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":360,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy Control","description":"A group of participants with no previous symptoms or diagnosis of TIA or stroke."},{"label":"Non-TIA Control","description":"A group of participants who were referred to TIA clinic with symptoms of a TIA, however, were subsequently confirmed as not suffering with a TIA."},{"label":"TIA, non-stroke","description":"A group of participants who were confirmed as suffering a TIA by a stroke clinician following admission to hospital, admission to Accident and Emergency or after being referred to TIA clinic.
