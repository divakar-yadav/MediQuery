Patients are devided into groups, in group A kinesiotaping facilitation technique is applied on wrist extensor muscles while inhibition technique is applied on wrist flexor muscles and the result is the compared between the groups and within the group.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a very common disease worldwide causing severe musculoskeletal disability due to which quality of life of patient compromises, patient becomes dependent of assistance in daily living activities and few becomes bed ridden. Stroke also causes death of the patient. Apart from musculoskeletal issues patient's cognitive abilities are also effected. It is tough to manage these patients as stroke varies in types and symptoms. Symptoms and severity depend upon type of stroke and factors like lifestyle, age and health issues. According to the symptoms different physiotherapy techniques and rehabilitation is used along with medical treatment and counseling of the patient. Kinesiotape also has the advantage that it can be worn 3-5 days due to which it's effects remains for long time as compare to other treatments which are given and has effect for a specific time for example a session of physical therapy including exercises is for an hour but this tape can be worn for days once applied.\n\nRandomized controlled trial was done, 24 patients were recruited according to inclusion exclusion criteria. Patients were further divided into two groups; group 1 was given muscular facilitation treatment for wrist extensors and group 2 was given sessions for muscle inhibition treatment for wrist flexors. 6 sessions were given, 1 session per week over the period of 6 weeks to each patient.\n\nWrist range of motion for extension, flexion, ulnar and medial deviation was measured using goniometer before and after the 6 weeks. Manual muscle test for wrist extensors, modified ashworth scale and upper limb functional index scoring was done before and after sessions. Data was collected from a private clinic of PWD Rawalpindi.\n\nThe statistical values of result showed no significant change in between both the groups, before and after treatment. But a significant improvement was about observed within the group analysis It can be concluded from this study that Kinesiotape is an effective treatment method both in inhibiting and facilitating muscular performance. Hence both treatments were equally effective. it helps in increasing range of motion and in reducing spasticity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Manual Muscle testing","Kinesiotape","Range of Motion","Upper Extremity Functional Index","Modified Ashworth Scale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two group were taken and given treatment with the concern study protocols.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The participants were blinded to the allocation in the experimental treatment groups.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hyperactive muscle correction for wrist extensors: Kinesiotape was applied to facilitate wrist extensor muscles from proximal to distal with 15-35% tension in therapeutic zone and no tension at anchor and end.","interventionNames":["Other: Kinesiotaping for wrist extensor muscles"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hypoactive muscle correction for wrist flexors: Wrist flexors muscles were inhibited by applying tape from distal to proximal with 15-25% tension in therapeutic zone and no tension at anchor and end.","interventionNames":["Other: Kinsiotaping for wrist flexor muscles"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Kinsiotaping for wrist flexor muscles","description":"The flexor muscles of the wrist area will be targeted.","armGroupLabels":["Group 2"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Kinesiotaping for wrist extensor muscles","description":"The extensor muscles of the wrist area will be targeted.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wrist extensors manual muscle test score","description":"Wrist extensors strength was measured as baseline before the start of intervention and was compared with the measurement after 6 weeks of application of kinesiotape.","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Wrist ROMS through Goniometer","description":"Wrist ROM was measured using universal goniometer, baseline values for wrist flexion, extension, ulnar deviation and medial deviation was measured and then compared to the values measured after 6 weeks of intervention.","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Spasticity through modified ashwoth scale","description":"Wrist spasticity was measured through modified ashworth scale before the intervention and then was compared with the values taken after 6th week","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Upper extremity functional index (UEFI)","description":"Patient was asked to perform different activities as opening the door and combing hair, score was done according to the difficulty level faced by patients while performing the activities.
