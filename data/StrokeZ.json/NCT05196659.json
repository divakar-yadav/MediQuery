To describe current practices, context, challenges, and opportunities regarding chronic management of cardiovascular disease from the patient, caregiver, provider, and health administrator perspectives in India.\n2. To assess the transferability of components of internationally successful multifaceted quality improvement strategies and chronic care models to the Indian healthcare context.\n3. To conduct a pilot study to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and implementation fidelity of the C-QIP strategy among individuals with cardiovascular disease attending out-patient clinics in India.\n4. Among individuals with cardiovascular disease, evaluate the effect of C-QIP strategy on processes of care and clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life, and costs at 1 year compared with usual care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Heart Disease","Ischemic Stroke","Heart Failure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Individual randomized parallel-group feasibility trial","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CONTROL Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"* Regular current system of care\n* Treating physicians provided current cardiovascular disease management guidelines\n* Patients provided a leaflet (printed information) on healthy lifestyle"},{"label":"INTERVENTION Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"1.
