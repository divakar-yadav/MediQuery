All participants will use a Fitbit wearable device to establish a baseline step count, select a step goal increase of 33% to 50% above their baseline and then participate in an 8 week intervention. The gamification arm will be entered into a game with points and levels designed using insights from behavioral economics. They will be asked to select a social support partner who will receive weekly updates on their progress in the game."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["physical activity","wearable","gamification"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants will wear the Fitbit device and record their daily step counts during the baseline and 8 week intervention period.
