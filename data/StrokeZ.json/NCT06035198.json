Based on this, we will use artificial intelligence analysis technology to predict the functional status of stroke patients in the chronic stage after their disability is fixed. We aim to develop the next generation of personalized digital twins by creating a prognostic prediction model."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Patients diagnosed with stroke at four hospitals in Korea","interventionNames":["Other: Stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Stroke","description":"No intervention","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Barthel Index (MBI)","description":"A scale to measure disability or dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) of stroke survivors (range 0-100)","timeFrame":"minimum 6 months to maximum 6 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE)","description":"Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30-question assessment of cognitive function that evaluates attention and orientation, memory, registration, recall, calculation, language and ability to draw a complex polygon (range 0-30)","timeFrame":"minimum 6 months to maximum 6 years"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC)","description":"The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a 6-point functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability, determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device.
