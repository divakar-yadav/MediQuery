Currently, there is no effective treatment for spatial neglect. A therapy called SIGHT (Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy) has shown early evidence of improving stroke survivors' spatial neglect (Rossit et al., 2019). SIGHT involves individuals picking-up and balance wooden rods with their less affected hand, independently, without the need for a therapist present at all times. Working with stroke survivors, carers and clinicians we have developed of a computerized version of SIGHT (c-SIGHT; Morse et al., in press). The present trial aims to: 1) investigate the feasibility of a blinded randomized controlled trial of c-SIGHT (active intervention) vs. an attentional control training version of c-SIGHT (sham intervention) in the homes of stroke survivors with spatial neglect; 2) Explore participant's experience using c-SIGHT independently at home; and 3) Explore the potential effects and effect size of c-SIGHT active intervention compared to the attentional control training to inform a future Phase II trial.","detailedDescription":"This is a multi-centre, two-arm blinded feasibility clinical trial with an embedded qualitative study. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized (using minimization) to either: active vs. sham version of computerised Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy (c-SIGHT). Randomization and group allocation will be managed and run by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit (independent from research team and outcome assessors). Participants, carers, outcome assessors, clinical care team and research team will be blinded to participant group allocation. Participants allocated to the active intervention c-SIGHT group will be required to lift and balance three wooden rods of different lengths. Those in the attentional control c-SIGHT group will use the same equipment, but will be required to lift the rods from one end only and not attempt to balance them (an attentional control). During the first training session a therapist (independent from the outcome assessors) will set-up the equipment and train the participant to self-administer the relevant version of c-SIGHT independently (i.e., without the presence of a therapist). Following this training session, participants will self-administer the training for 10 consecutive days (thirty-minute sessions 2 times a day - 'Training phase'). On the last day of the training (day 10) the therapist will return to participant's homes to complete a monitoring visit and collect equipment. To monitor adherence and therapy compliance the therapist will collect photos and videos of the first and last session of the training. A blinded assessor will collect outcome assessments at the end of the training phase (T1) and at one-month post-training (T2). The post-training (T1) data collection visit will also include one-to-one semi-structured interviews with stroke survivor participants and their carers (qualitative study)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spatial Neglect","Inattention"],"keywords":["Stroke","Spatial Neglect","c-SIGHT","Feasibility Trial","Telerehabilition","Home-based therapy","Attention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants are randomly allocated (using minimisation) to either the active intervention or attentional control group.
