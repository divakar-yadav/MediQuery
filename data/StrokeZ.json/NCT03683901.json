Treatments are compared with no stimulation.","detailedDescription":"Single cohort, cross-over study. Subjects undergo passive pain-free ROM of the painful post-stroke shoulder under 3 stimulation conditions. The stimulation was delivered by a trained occupational therapist under three conditions: 10 seconds of TENS, 10 seconds of t-NMES, and 10 seconds of no stimulation. Each subject was exposed to each of the three stimulation conditions three times in a computer-generated random sequence for each outcome measure with a 5-minute wash-out period between each stimulation. This protocol is repeated for each of the two passive movements tested, shoulder abduction and shoulder external rotation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Electrical stimulation therapy","TENS","t-NMES","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Cohort study; single group but with random serial allocation of treatment type","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Participant, Investigator, and Outcomes Assessor were masked to the particular stimulation during each range of motion assessment"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TENS/t-NMES/No stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TENS stimulation parameters were of a symmetric waveform, a frequency of 100 Hz, and a pulse duration of 300 microseconds (EMPI 300PVTM program PPR #7) applied for 10 seconds. t-NMES parameters were a symmetric waveform with 2 second ramp-up and 2 second ramp-down, a frequency of 35Hz, and a pulse duration of 300 microseconds (EMPI 300PVTM program PPR #3).
