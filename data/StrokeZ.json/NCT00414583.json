Normally older people have a stroke, but also a significant number of younger people between 18 and 55 years. Usually, these cannot be explained by the classical risk factors such as diabetes, overweight and high blood pressure. New studies indicate that in about 1 - 2 % of the younger stroke patients the cause could have been an undiagnosed genetic disease, the so called Fabry disease. The purpose of this study is to determine in a large number of young stroke patients, how many strokes were caused by Fabry Disease.","detailedDescription":"Aim:\n\nTo determine the frequency of Fabry disease in an unselected group of young patients (18 - 55 years of age) with acute cerebrovascular event (CVE)\n\nFabry disease and stroke:\n\nRolfs and co-workers have shown a high frequency of Fabry disease in a cohort of patients with cryptogenic stroke (4 % \\[28/721\\]) aged between 18 and 55 years. This corresponds to about 1.2 % in the general population of young stroke patients. Therefore the authors stated that Fabry disease must be considered in all cases of unexplained stroke in young patients, especially in cases with the combination of infarction in the vertebrobasilar artery system and proteinuria.\n\nCryptogenic strokes are cerebrovascular lesions of unknown origin. Clinical and laboratory data show that Fabry disease is itself a risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and cardiac and renal disease, which can lead to emboli and hypertension. The pilot-phase started April 2007; the official study started January 2008."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebrovascular Accident, Acute","CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","Cerebral Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Cerebrovascular Stroke","Fabry Disease","Anderson-Fabry Disease","Fabry's Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Fabry diagnostic will be done centrally: blood samples will be retained for analysis of a-galactosidase in blood to diagnose an a-galactosidase deficit; in females direct analysis of the gene has to be done since due to the Lyonisation effect a-galactosidase activity might be normal in blood although the patient might suffer from Fabry disease."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observation","description":"all adult patients (18 - 55 years of age) with an acute cerebrovascular event of any etiology","interventionNames":["Other: No intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention","description":"Observational study, only laboratory analysis and diagnostic interventions done; no drug tested","armGroupLabels":["Observation"],"otherNames":["only 1 observational group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of Fabry disease in the unselected group of young stroke patients","timeFrame":"baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Classification of stroke subtype in patients identified to have Fabry disease acc. to TOAST criteria, modified Rankin scale, Barthel index and MRI criteria.","timeFrame":"baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients (18 - 55 years of age) with an acute cerebrovascular event of any etiology defined as patients having an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack less than 3 months before enrollment into the study\n* MRI-scan evidence of associated corresponding brain infarction or hemorrhage, regardless of the duration of symptoms.
