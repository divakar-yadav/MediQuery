The main idea is to look by Genome Wide Association (arrays that determine more than 1 million polymorphisms) genetic risk factors associated with response to dabigatran. To conduct the study, the goal is to recruit 300 patients with ischemic stroke with cardioembolic etiology treated with dabigatran and 200 treated with Acenocoumarol to determine if genetic risk factors are associated with the occurrence of any bleeding or vascular event in a year follow-up.","detailedDescription":"Data will be analyzed through GWAS analysis. The results will be analyzed by experienced genotypic bioinformatics: Plink, Haploview, STATA, IMPUTE2, SNPtest, GTOOL, Galaxy management. In addition, the investigators have support of Spanish Consortium for Genetics of Stroke (Genestroke). The PLINK software is the main program for the analysis of GWAS. Using this software we can clean the raw results of genotyping platforms and determine the presence of risk alleles associated with resistance to the study drugs. Haploview software will be used for data management and graphics for significance analysis. STATA statistical software is a data management and very useful for the creation of Q_Q plots graphs that assist in the interpretation of genotypic results. GTOOL, SNPtest and IMPUTE2 are software for data imputation and analysis of imputed data through the information available in the 1000 Genomes Project."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardioembolic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","oral
