We hypothesized that experimental group (VR-based training with dual-tDCS) would improve distal upper extremity function rather than control group (VR-based training with dual sham tDCS).","detailedDescription":"This is a double-blind, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 : 1 ratio to experimental group (VR-based training with dual-tDCS; VR-Dual) or the control group (VR-based training with dual sham tDCS; VR-Sham) . For both conditions, VR-Dual and VR-Sham group commenced at the same time (20 minutes). The therapist and patients were blinded as to whether the patients received real or sham tDCS. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Rehabilitation Center, Korea, and all participants provided written informed consent before enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke
