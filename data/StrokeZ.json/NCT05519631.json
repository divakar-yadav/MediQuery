According to the Ministry of Health, stroke is responsible for 40% of early retirements, being one of the most important causes of mortality in Brazil. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been shown to be a very useful tool in the study of functional status and for the diagnosis of brain damage and disorders. It is considered a simple, non-invasive test with high temporal resolution, being a method widely used in laboratories to non-invasively monitor brain activity.","detailedDescription":"Stroke has been considered one of the main causes of long-term disability in the adult population, and is no longer considered a disease of the elderly, since 2/3 of all strokes occur among people under 70 years of age. According to the Ministry of Health, stroke is responsible for 40% of early retirements, being one of the most important causes of mortality in Brazil. Stroke usually causes long-term deficits such as asymmetrical muscle weakness between limbs, impaired proprioceptive ability, sensory loss, vision problems, and spasticity. In addition, these sensorimotor deficits interfere with various functions of the lower limbs, including balance, postural control, and gait ability, affecting their quality of life. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been shown to be a very useful tool in the study of functional status and for the diagnosis of brain damage and disorders. It is considered a simple, non-invasive test with high temporal resolution, being a method widely used in laboratories to non-invasively monitor brain activity. Microstates reflect short periods (\\~100 ms) of nearly stable brain states evolving over time, resulting from the synchronous and coordinated activity of brain networks. The aim of this study is to observe whether EEG microstates have correlations with clinical characteristics of people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Electroencephalogram"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"subacute stroke","description":"Participants were evaluated for clinical outcome before the electroencephalogram examination.

The capture of electrical signals is performed by attaching electrodes to the surface of the scalp.

The electrode-electrolyte interface is very important and must be able to provide a good connection between the skin and the conductive material of the electrode, otherwise the EEG signal, in addition to being contaminated by noise, may suffer distortion.","armGroupLabels":["chronic stroke","healthy","subacute stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"eeg microstates","description":"We will determine the number of topographic maps using a pre-determined criterion of the four \"classical\" maps (A, B, C and D) and classify the continuous EEG data according to the topographic map with which a given stretch has the highest correlation.","timeFrame":"Immediately after evaluation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relationship between microstates and injury severity","description":"They were evaluated with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to quantify the severity and magnitude of the neurological deficit after the stroke.","timeFrame":"Immediately after evaluation"},{"measure":"Relationship between microstates and cognitive function","description":"assessment of cognitive function - Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","timeFrame":"Immediately after evaluation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* people over 18 years of age, regardless of sex and with a stroke confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* have other associated neurological pathology","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The sample consisted of 45 people, 15 individuals with subacute stroke, 15 individuals with chronic stroke and 15 healthy controls, selected for convenience.
