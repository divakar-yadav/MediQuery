Results will be compared to a matched group of patients undergoing anodal tDCS as well as a control group receiving sham tDCS. Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before/after the intervention and during a 3 month follow-up will help investigating neural correlates of expected changes in motor function of the affected upper extremity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","tDCS","Motor cortex"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual tDCS + motor training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Motor training of the affected upper extremity combined with dual transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Behavioral: Motor training"]},{"label":"Anodal tDCS + motor training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Motor training of the affected upper extremity combined with anodal tDCS.","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Behavioral: Motor training"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS + motor training","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Motor training of the affected upper extremity combined with sham tDCS.","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Behavioral: Motor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","armGroupLabels":["Anodal tDCS + motor training","Dual tDCS + motor training","Sham tDCS + motor training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motor training","description":"Motor training of the affected upper extremity (5 days, 25 min/day).","armGroupLabels":["Anodal tDCS + motor training","Dual tDCS + motor training","Sham tDCS + motor training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Function of the Affected Upper Extremity","description":"Effects of dual tDCS + training vs sham-tDCS + training on the motor function of the affected upper extremity (measured by standardized behavioral tests).","timeFrame":"Change from baseline after 5 days (immediately after intervention)"},{"measure":"Motor Function of the Affected Upper Extremity","description":"Effects of dual tDCS + training vs sham-tDCS + training on the motor function of the affected upper extremity (measured by standardized behavioral tests).","timeFrame":"change from baseline after 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor Function of the Affected Upper Extremity","description":"Effects of dual tDCS + training vs anodal tDCS + training on the motor function of the affected upper extremity (measured by standardized behavioral tests).","timeFrame":"After 5 days (immediately after intervention), after 3 months vs baseline (before intervention)"},{"measure":"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging","description":"Effects of dual tDCS + training vs anodal tDCS + training vs sham-tDCS + training on task-specific activations and functional connectivity (measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fMRI).","timeFrame":"After 5 days (immediately after intervention), after 3 months vs baseline (before intervention)"},{"measure":"Diffusion Tensor Imaging","description":"Effects of dual tDCS + training vs anodal tDCS + training vs sham-tDCS + training on cerebral microstructure (measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging, DTI).","timeFrame":"After 5 days (immediately after intervention), after 3 months vs baseline (before intervention)"},{"measure":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","description":"Effects of dual tDCS + training vs anodal tDCS + training vs sham tDCS + training on excitability of the primary motor cortex (measured by Motor Evoked Potentials, MEP, using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, TMS).","timeFrame":"After 5 days vs baseline (before intervention)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* chronic stroke (\\>6 months after stroke)\n* age: 18 to 80 years\n* non-hemorrhagic or hemorrhagic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* more than 1 stroke\n* severe alcohol disease or drug abuse, severe psychiatric disease like depression or psychosis\n* severe cognitive deficits\n* severe untreated medical conditions\n* other neurologic diseases\n* severe microangiopathy\n* pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Robert Lindenberg, M.D.","affiliation":"Charite University, Berlin, Germany","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Charite Universitätsmedizin Berlin","city":"Berlin","zip":"10117","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.52437,"lon":13.41053}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21068427","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Lindenberg R, Renga V, Zhu LL, Nair D, Schlaug G.
