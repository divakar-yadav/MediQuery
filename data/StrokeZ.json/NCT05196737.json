In people with chronic stroke, one of the most common and disabling problems is spasticity (increased muscle tone or muscle stiffness). The purpose of this research study is to examine effects of dry needling on the nervous system (pathways between the muscle, spinal cord, and brain) in people with spasticity due to chronic stroke. Dry needling is a procedure in which a thin, stainless steel needle is inserted into the skin to produce a muscle twitch response. It is intended to release a knot in the muscle and relieve pain.\n\nThe total study duration is 7 visits over 2 weeks. There will be 4 visits the first week, and 3 visits the second week. The first visit will take about 1.5 hours, during which study staff will determine the best placement of electrodes and create a cast of the participant's leg to aid them in quickly placing the electrodes on the remainder of the visits. The second and fifth visits will last about 3.5 hours, and all other visits will last about 1.5 hours. Dry needling will take place on the fifth visit only. During each visit the participant will be asked to participate in examinations of reflexes (muscle responses to non-invasive nerve stimulation) and leg function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity, Muscle","CVA"],"keywords":["Dry Needling","Nervous System","Central Nervous System","Reflexes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non-Intervention Week Reflex Measurements","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Baseline reflex measurements will be collected during the first week of the study (Visits 1-4).

Participants will receive dry needling to relieve spasticity in the target calf muscle (middle gastrocnemius) during Visit 5. The study team will examine the effects of this treatment on the nervous system by performing assessments just prior to DDN, immediately after DDN, 90 minutes after DDN, 24 hours after DDN, and 72 hours after DDN.
