Patients must also have no exclusion criteria for IV thrombolysis within the 3 to 4.5 hour window. The only required imaging is non-contrasted CT of the head. Patients will be monitored according to standard post-thrombolytic care. A CT of the head will be performed at 24 hours based on standard protocol or if there is any neurological change. Neurological function at 24 hours using NIHSS and at 3 months based on modified mRS and the NIHSS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebral Infarction","Ischemic Stroke","Thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV - Maximum dose: 25 mg","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Alteplase","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Alteplase 0.9 mg/kg IV - Maximum dose: 90 mg","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV - Maximum 25 mg","armGroupLabels":["Tenecteplase"],"otherNames":["TNKase"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase","description":"Alteplase 0.9 mg/kg IV - Maximum: 90 mg","armGroupLabels":["Alteplase"],"otherNames":["Activase","t-PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological outcome","description":"Measured by modified Rankin Scale score","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Twenty-four hour brain CT scan showing intracranial hemorrhage in conjuction with neurological deterioration of 4 points or more on the NIHSS","timeFrame":"24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
