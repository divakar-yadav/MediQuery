It is hypothesized that the improvement in functional outcomes as measured by NIHSS and BI as well as the improvement in haemostatic parameters as measured by thrombocyte aggregation test (TAT), fibrinogen, and d-dimer in DLBS group will be significantly greater than those in the control group.","detailedDescription":"Subjects in this study will be screened consecutively and eligible subjects will be randomized into two groups and receive the investigational drug, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg three times daily or its placebo in addition to standard therapy for 28-days course of therapy. Standard therapy used in this study will consist of: aspirin 80 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and vitamin B complex.\n\nAfter hospital admission and diagnosis, patient will be handled as per acute ischemic stroke management in each study site. Right after the patient is confirmed eligible to the study, the treatment(s) will be switched immediately into the study treatments. Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy will be performed at baseline and 3, 7,14, and 28 days after study medication initiation; while safety examinations will be performed at the same time point, but 3 and 14 days after study medication initiation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Partial Anterior Circulation Infarct","Lacunar Anterior Circulation Infarct"],"keywords":["DLBS1033","Acute ischemic stroke","NIHSS","Barthel Index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo 3 x 1 tablet, given everyday for 28 days of study period","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"DLBS1033","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"DLBS1033 enteric-coated tablet 3 x 490 mg daily, given everyday for 28 days of study period","interventionNames":["Drug: DLBS1033"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"DLBS1033","description":"Investigational drug or placebo will be given in addition to the standard therapy, consists of: aspirin enteric-coated tablet 1 x 80 mg daily, simvastatin film-coated tablet 1 x 20 mg daily, and vitamin B complex 1 x 1 tablet","armGroupLabels":["DLBS1033"],"otherNames":["Disolf"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Investigational drug or placebo will be given in addition to the standard therapy, consists of: aspirin enteric-coated tablet 1 x 80 mg daily, simvastatin film-coated tablet 1 x 20 mg daily, and vitamin B complex 1 x 1 tablet","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","description":"Change in functional outcomes as measured by NIHSS from its baseline value","timeFrame":"3, 7, 14, and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"Barthel Index (BI)","description":"Change in functional outcomes as measured by BI from its baseline value","timeFrame":"3, 7, 14, and 28 days after study medication"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Thrombocyte Aggregation Test (TAT)","description":"Change in haemostatic parameter as measured by TAT from its baseline value","timeFrame":"3, 7, 14, and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"Fibrinogen level","description":"Change in haemostatic parameter as measured by fibrinogen level from its baseline value","timeFrame":"3, 7, 14, and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"D-dimer level","description":"Change in haemostatic parameter as measured by d-dimer level from its baseline value","timeFrame":"3, 7, 14, and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"Liver function","description":"Liver function measured includes: serum AST, ALT, gamma-GT, total bilirubin","timeFrame":"7 and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"Renal function","description":"Renal function measured includes: serum creatinine","timeFrame":"7 and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"Routine hematology","description":"Routine hematology measured includes: hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differentiation of WBC, and platelet count","timeFrame":"7 and 28 days after study medication"},{"measure":"Adverse events","description":"Adverse events, including bleeding events, will be observed and carefully evaluated along the course of the study","timeFrame":"1 -
