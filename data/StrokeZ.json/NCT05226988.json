In addition to conventional rehabilitation training, robot-assisted training has been advocated as a contemporary approach of hand function training. Robotic devices can be categorized into exoskeleton and end-effector types based on their mechanical design. However, previous studies did not reach an agreement on the effectiveness of two types of robot-assisted training. The study firstly proposes a hybrid robot-assisted training program, which combines two types of robotic systems, to enhance the effectiveness of robot-assisted training and provide a new approach for motor training of upper limb in stroke patients. Secondly, the relative effects of the two types of robot-assisted training will be compared. The purpose of this study is to examine the immediate and long-term effects of hybrid robot-assisted training , exoskeleton robot-assisted training , end-effector robot-assisted training , and conventional training on stroke patients' motor performance, daily life functions, quality of life, and self-efficacy. The study will recruit stroke patients and randomly assign them to the hybrid robot-assisted training, exoskeleton robot-assisted training, end-effector robot-assisted training, and conventional training groups. Each participant will receive training 3 sessions a week for 6 consecutive weeks. Participants will be assessed at baseline, after the intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Repeated measures of analysis of variance will be used to evaluate the changes within each intervention group at three evaluation times and to compare the differences between the four intervention groups. In order to understand the motor learning effects after receiving different interventions, the investigator use kinematic analysis to investigate the movement control mechanism of upper limb movements. The findings of this study will build the evidence-based foundation for bridging the gap between basic science and clinical application."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["neurorehabilitation","robot-assisted training","upper extremity","motor control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hybrid-RT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"hybrid robot-assisted training","interventionNames":["Device: robot-assisted"]},{"label":"Exo-RT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"exoskeleton robot-assisted training","interventionNames":["Device: robot-assisted"]},{"label":"EE-RT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"end-effector robot-assisted training","interventionNames":["Device: robot-assisted"]},{"label":"conventional training groups","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Conventional rehabilitation intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"robot-assisted","description":"Participants received the 18-session robot-assisted intervention 3 sessions a week for 6 consecutive weeks.
