Conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) and high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) will be used to stimulate the prefrontal cortex of the brain. EEG and fMRI will be collected before, during and after stimulation to understand the impact of stimulation on brain dynamics. The investigators hypothesize that the stimulation of the prefrontal cortex will improve performance during cognitive tasks along with changes in the neural processing detected by neuroimaging modalities."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stimulation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator","description":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation device that can excite or inhibit the brain activity depending on the stimulation protocol.
