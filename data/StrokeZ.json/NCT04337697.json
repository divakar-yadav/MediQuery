Although prognosis in early childhood is a critical question for parents and providers, outcomes beyond infancy are largely unknown. Further, parents of infants with neonatal seizures are at risk for mental health disorders, which can undermine their ability to care for a child with medical complexity and may contribute to impaired child development.\n\nThe NSR-DEV study is a longitudinal cohort study of around 280 Neonatal Seizure Registry participants enrolled at one of nine sites across the USA. Participants will be evaluated using developmental questionnaires and in-person neurodevelopmental testing. Parent well-being will be assessed at each time point."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neonatal Seizure","Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy","Stroke","Intracranial Hemorrhages","Epilepsy","Cerebral Palsy","Intellectual Disability"],"keywords":["Family impact","Neurodevelopment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"4 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":280,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Full scale IQ (FSIQ) score for each child on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 4th Edition (WPPSI-IV)","description":"The WPPSI-IV is an in-person assessment administered by a psychologist or psychometrician that will be used to measure neurocognitive ability.
