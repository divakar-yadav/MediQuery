Outpatients with an elevated risk for atrial fibrillation will be randomized to an intervention arm (app group) and to a standard-of-care arm (control group). Both groups will have the app installed on their private smartphones and will be asked to perform a predefined measurement protocol. All patients will continue their prior therapy with their general practitioner and obtain every medical treatment indicated. This study will not cause any restrictions on the usual treatment of the study patients.\n\nThe only difference between the two groups will be, that patients in the app group will be informed by their local PI, if the recordings of the app indicate AF (and obtain a 14 day Holter ECG for AF verification), whereas the patients in the \"usual care\" group will obtain the read out of the app at the end of the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial Fibrillation","Smartphone App","CHA2DS2-VASc-Score","Screening","Cardiovascular risk factors","Outpatient setting","Congestive heart failure","Stroke","Diabetes","Vascular disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"In this study, the effect of a smartphone application in detecting AF will be assessed in a double-blind randomised controlled trial.
