Participants will exercise three times a week and receive weekly education about how to take care of themselves after a stroke. The YMCA staff who deliver the program will have specialized training about how to help people with a stroke exercise safely and effectively. The hospital within each region will provide specialized on-site physiotherapy consultative support. The comparator standard YMCA membership will include typical sessions with a wellness coach who has basic safety training regarding stroke and exercise."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Community program","Wellness","Exercise","Physical
