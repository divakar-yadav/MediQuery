At present, most studies have focused on the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing after stroke, while stroke-related insomnia has been neglected. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore a treatment that combines stroke protection with sleep improvement.\n\nRemote ischemic conditioning (RIC) triggers endogenous protective effect through transient and repeated ischemia in the limb to protect remote tissues and organs. The mechanisms of LRIC involve the regulation of autonomic nervous system, release of humoral factors, improvement of vascular endothelial function and modulation of immune/inflammatory responses, which participate in the regulation of sleep after stroke.Therefore, this study intends to conduct a randomized controlled trial to further reveal the effect of RIC in stroke-related insomnia and explore its potential mechanisms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["remote ischemic conditioning","acute ischemic stroke","insomnia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":136,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects in the intervention group will recieve remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) treatment twice a day for 3 months.","interventionNames":["Device: Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC)"]},{"label":"Sham control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Subject in the sham control group will recieve sham remote ischemic conditioning (Sham-RIC) treatment twice a day for 3 months.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham remote ischemic conditioning (Sham-RIC)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC)","description":"RIC is a non-invasive therapy which is performed by automated pneumatic cuffs placed on bilateral arms.
