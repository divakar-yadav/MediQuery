The ORIENT diet retains the core components of the DASH, Mediterranean, and MIND diets, but incorporates adjustments according to evidence derived from Asian prospective cohorts and Chinese dietary practices. Participants in the intervention group will receive the ORIENT diet intervention, while participants in the control group will receive standard low-sodium and low-fat dietary advice. The study's primary objective is to assess the impact of the ORIENT diet on the brain functional networks of individual with high risk of stroke. The investigation will explore potential mediators and modifiers of the intervention's effects by collecting various cardiovascular risk factors, serum samples, fecal samples, neuropsychological assessment results, and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["High Risk of Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Brain functional
