This gap in treatment is due to a lack of tools to provide explicit feedback on patients' volitional finger force generation. To address this unmet need, the investigators developed a novel tool for practice of volitional three-dimensional (3D) force generation with explicit feedback. The objective of this project is to determine if 3D finger force training is an effective tool in restoring hand function post stroke.\n\nStroke survivors with moderate to severe hand impairment with at least palpable volitional grip force will randomly be assigned to either the experimental or control group, stratified by impairment level. Both groups will undergo 3 1-hr training sessions per week for 6 weeks in which they practice volitional finger force generation against force sensors. The experimental group will practice for various target force directions to explore the 3D force workspace and receive feedback in 3D force, while the control group will practice 1D force generation without feedback on other directional forces on a computer screen.\n\nTraining will progress by increasing influence of flexion synergy by varying posture requirements and increasing force level, introducing feedback delay, and incorporating unilateral/bilateral activity. Evaluation will occur at baseline (3 times over 3 weeks to establish baseline trends) and every 2 weeks during 6-week intervention to determine pattern of progress, and at 1-month follow-up to assess retention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand Strength","Electromyography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"3D","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participant's voluntary grip forces in all 3 dimensions will be shown to the participant via computer screen.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: 3D"]},{"label":"1D","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The participant's voluntary grip force in 1 dimension will be shown to the participant via computer screen.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: 1D"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"3D","description":"Practice generating grip force to the target shown on the computer screen in 3 dimensions.","armGroupLabels":["3D"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"1D","description":"Practice generating grip force to the target shown on the computer screen in 1 dimension.","armGroupLabels":["1D"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","description":"a clinical assessment for upper extremity function","timeFrame":"3rd baseline to within 1 week post intervention"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"a clinical assessment for upper extremity function.","timeFrame":"3rd baseline to within 1 week post intervention"},{"measure":"Force Direction","description":"Angular deviation of the grip force vector from the target direction","timeFrame":"3rd baseline to within 1 week post intervention"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test","description":"a clinical assessment for upper extremity function","timeFrame":"3rd baseline to 1 month post intervention"},{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"a clinical assessment for upper extremity function.","timeFrame":"3rd baseline to 1 month post intervention"},{"measure":"Force Direction","description":"Angular deviation of the grip force vector from the target direction","timeFrame":"baseline to 1 month post intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Survived a stroke at least 3 months ago\n* Moderate to severe hand impairment (Chedoke-McMaster Hand Stage 2-4)\n* Ability to generate palpable volitional grip force upon cue\n* Sufficient cognitive ability to participate (NIH Stroke Scale, NIHSS, Questions and Commands score = 0-1)\n* Ability to recognize all quadrants of the visual field (NIHSS Visual Field Test score = 0)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Concurrent upper limb rehabilitation\n* Inability to follow 2-step commands\n* Severe muscle tone prohibiting passive movement of the fingers or proper placement of the fingers on the force sensors as needed to participate in the training (Modified Ashworth Scale=4-5 out of 5)\n* Change in spasticity medication or botulinum toxin injection in the upper limb within 3 months prior to or during enrollment\n* Total sensory loss on fingertips (NIHSS Sensory score=2)\n* Comorbidity (e.g., orthopaedic conditions that limit ranges of motion, premorbid neurologic conditions)\n* Language barrier or cognitive impairment that precludes providing consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Na Jin Seo, PhD MS BS","affiliation":"Ralph H.
