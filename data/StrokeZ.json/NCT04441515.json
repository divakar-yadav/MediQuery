Therefore, this study seeks to explore the effect of providing patient preferred music to patients in the very early post stroke period (within 24 hours of a left cerebral artery stroke \\[LMCA\\]event) as a complementary modality to usual stroke care.","detailedDescription":"Aim I. The primary aim of MASTER is to identify whether a potential relationship exists between an intervention of participant preferred music, when initiated within the first 24 hours following a left middle cerebral artery stroke, and a reduction in the following disabilities: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit and post stroke depression. This aim will serve to address the first research hypothesis and address the relationship between These disabilities are well known sequalae among patients diagnosed with the most common form of stroke, a LMCA stroke. Participant preferred music within the first 24 hours following a LMCA stroke and a reduction in: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit and post stroke depression, as these disabilities are well known sequalae among LMCA stroke patients.\n\nAim II. The second aim of MASTER is to identify if a relationship exists between an intervention of audible books, when initiated within the first 24 hours following a LMCA stroke, and a reduction in the following disabilities: Expressive aphasia, right hand functional deficit and post stroke depression.\n\nSufficient evidence exists to suggest that although listening to books stimulates cognitive function, the effect of melody and participant engagement in music is far superior to listening to words alone as the inherent rhythmicity of patient-favored music has been shown to strengthen synchronous neuronal connectivity, by modulating dopamine and inducing fine grained neuroanatomical changes in a recovering brain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Expressive Aphasia","Movement, Abnormal","Depressive Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Music","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"music supplied by ipod","interventionNames":["Device: Ipod with music"]},{"label":"oral books","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Listening to books on ipod","interventionNames":["Device: ipod with books to listen"]},{"label":"usual care","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual care","interventionNames":["Device: ipod only with usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Ipod with music","description":"music of patient's preference provided 2 hours daily","armGroupLabels":["Music"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ipod with books to listen","description":"2 hours of daily listening to books","armGroupLabels":["oral books"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ipod only with usual care","description":"participants given device only","armGroupLabels":["usual care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"expressive aphasia measured by use of the WAB-R","description":"Change in expressive aphasia will be measured by use of the WAB-R. Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB- R).This instrument is intended to provide a standardized measure of aphasia type and severity. Implementation of the instrument takes 15 approximately minutes to complete. THE WAB-R identifies and classifies 8 aphasia types: Global, Broca's, Isolation, Transcortical Motor, Wernicke's, transcortical Sensory, Conduction and Anomic. The WAB-R assesses linguistic skills more frequently affected by aphasia.
