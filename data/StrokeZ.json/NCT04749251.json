The aim of this pilot randomized clinical trial is to determine whether randomization to a standard versus individual blood pressure management strategy during the EVT procedure is feasible.","detailedDescription":"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the Western world. Catheter-based removal of blood clots (endovascular therapy-EVT) is now the standard of care for AIS caused by large vessel occlusions in the brain. The level of blood pressure during the procedure appears to influence outcome. However, optimal blood pressure management strategy has not been determined. Current blood pressure management strategy during EVT typically aims to maintain blood pressure above or within predefined fixed targets and is based on observational data and expert consensus rather than on high-quality randomized evidence. Should blood pressure during removal of the occlusion be managed according to the patient's individual blood pressure level or according to predefined fixed blood pressure targets? The primary aim of this pilot trial is to determine whether randomization to a procedure strategy targeting a predefined mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of 70-90 mmHg versus an individual strategy targeting Â± 10 % of a MABP reference value is feasible. Secondary aims are to test recruitability and to detect challenges or obstacles that would call for changes in the study design."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Endovascular therapy","Blood pressure","Anesthesia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study will be performed as a single center study, conducted at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.
