It is an indicator of health service needs and a way to evaluate health status in a very efficient way. Psychoeducation can be applied in medical and nursing practice, as an intervention that can improve and/or maintain the quality of life, especially if it is provided to patients without a significant cognitive deficit. Psychoeducational programmes can be defined as didactic-therapeutic interventions that serve to provide information about the disease, emotional and social support and, last but not least, facilitate adaptation to new life situations.","detailedDescription":"Detailed description:\n\nThe influence of selected aspects on HRQoL will be statistically assessed in the initial phase of the research. At a later stage, the monitored file will be randomized, in a predefined 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe control group will be provided only with conventional treatment focused on neurorehabilitation care according to the workplace's habits, and structured psychoeducation will be added to this usual care. The group psychoeducational interview, which reflects the issue of CVA, will be conducted face-to-face by a clinical psychologist, a health and social worker and a nurse. It will be limited by a 6-week therapy session 1 time per week, lasting approximately 45 minutes.\n\nPatients will be tested with 6 standardized questionnaires in the Czech language version initially before the start of treatment and subsequently one month post the completion date of their treatment. The EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D-5L) instrument will be used to assess HRQoL. The Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI) questionnaire has been chosen to identify problems related to problems associated with patient dignity. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test will be used to indicatively detect dementia and the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) will be used to diagnose the severity of depressive symptoms. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used to objectify the perception of pain and the Barthel Index (BI) for scoring ADL. At the same time, selected relevant clinical and anamnestic data will be extracted from the medical records."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Quality of Life"],"keywords":["stroke","life quality","evaluation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":447,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"With Psychoeducation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"interventional group will receive psychoeducation.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: psychotherapy"]},{"label":"Basic Therapy Only","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"this group will receive only basic therapy"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"psychotherapy","description":"Psychotherapy and psychoeducation in patients after stroke.","armGroupLabels":["With Psychoeducation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in patients after stroke","description":"Change in the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) \\[Time Frame: Baseline state (immediately prior to the rehabilitation facility admission) and follow-up monitoring (two and a half months after the rehabilitation facility admission)\\].\n\nHealth-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is assessed using the European Quality of Life Questionnaire version 5, level 5 instrument.
