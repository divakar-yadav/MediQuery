The overall goal of this project is to develop a text messaging intervention to improve hypertension care in the ED. This will first be done by testing the feasibility of identifying hypertensive patients in the ED, and the response rate to text messages."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Stroke"],"keywords":["hypertension treatment","stroke prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control, Not hypertensive","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants who after 3 weeks do not have high blood pressure or are not responsive to text messages."},{"label":"Text messages, hypertensive","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants who after 3 weeks have high blood pressure and are responsive to text messages, who are then randomized to receive text messages.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Text messaging"]},{"label":"No text messages, hypertensive","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants who after 3 weeks have high blood pressure and are responsive to text messages, who are then randomized to not receive text messages."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Text messaging","description":"persistently hypertensive participants will be randomized to receive these tailored, motivational text messages","armGroupLabels":["Text messages, hypertensive"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of people who respond to text messages and are persistently hypertensive","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure","timeFrame":"4 months"},{"measure":"Feasibility of a screening algorithm","description":"Proportion of subjects recruited compared to proportion of subjects approached.
