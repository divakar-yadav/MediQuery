Also check its correlation with Berg Balance Scale and Barthel Index","detailedDescription":"The English version of the Functional Gait Assessment Scale will be translated and culturally adapted as per previous recommendation. In geriatric population, Urdu Version of Functional Gait Assessment Scale will distributed among 160 participants choose by convenience sampling technique based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.To test inter and intra-observer reliability of the final Urdu Version of Functional Gait Assessment Scale, Barthel Index and Berg Balance Scale, questionnaire will be filled on the same day. Data will be entered and analyzed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences Version 24. Internal consistency will be analyzed with Cronbach alpha value. Test- retest reliability will be assessed for intra-class correlation coefficient. The Urdu Version of Functional Gait Assessment Scale was evaluated for content validity, construct validity, criterion validity and responsiveness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Functional Gait Assessment Scale","Urdu Version","Reliability","Validity","Stroke","Geriatric Population"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Gait Assessment Scale","description":"Functional Gait Assessment Scale is used to evaluate the constructions of balance and gait in ambulatory stroke patients.","timeFrame":"1st day"},{"measure":"Barthel Index","description":"Barthel Index is use to assess the level of independence and autonomy of stroke patient in performing ADLs.
