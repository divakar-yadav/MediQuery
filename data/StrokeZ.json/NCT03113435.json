During general anesthesia metabolic needs of the body are markedly reduced and increase in CO may not be necessary. In addition, excessive fluid administration has been related to worse post-operative outcomes. We divide patients into three groups: the standard treatment group, the NICE protocol group and the intervention group. In this group we use the v-aCO2/CaO2-CvO2 as marker of tissue ability to increase their oxygen consumption in response to increased O2 delivery, and based on this index the administration of fluid. The principal aim is to optimize functional hemodynamics in order to reduce the fluid balance at the end of the surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodynamic Instability"],"keywords":["CO2 gap","oxygen consumption","Stroke volume optimization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"In this group standard care will be provided to patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, regarding hemodynamic optimization"},{"label":"NICE group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm patients will be treated according to stroke volume optimization described in NICE program","interventionNames":["Other: Oxygen consumption optimization"]},{"label":"Oxygen consumption group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In this arm patients will receive hemodynamic optimization based on their oxygen consumption need","interventionNames":["Other: Oxygen consumption optimization"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Oxygen consumption optimization","description":"hemodynamic stability will be achieved through exploration of oxygen consumption need of the patient based on CO2gap/CaO2-CvO2 ratio","armGroupLabels":["NICE group","Oxygen consumption group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Perioperative fluid balance","description":"Perioperative fluid balance","timeFrame":"surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survival at 28 days","description":"Patients who survived at 28 days","timeFrame":"28 days after surgery"},{"measure":"Survival at hospital discharge","description":"Patient who survived at hospital discharge","timeFrame":"1 day (Hospital discharge)"},{"measure":"Post-operative complication","description":"Increase in TnI, need for mechanical ventilation, infection, ICU admission, anastomotic leak, bleeding, AKI","timeFrame":"1 day (Hospital discharge)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients aged \\> 18 years\n* acquisition of written informed consent\n* Major abdominal surgery (major gastrointestinal surgery: DCP, gastrectomy, Miles, emicolectomy; gynecologic surgery: oncologic surgery) Surgery times ≥ 3 hours\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Absolute contraindication to CVC placement\n* pregnant women\n* hepatic surgery\n* laparoscopic surgery\n* Major vascular surgery\n* Dialysis treatment and kidney transplant surgery\n* Severe heart failure (EF ≤ 35%)\n* Emergency surgery","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Antonio M Dell'Anna, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+390630154490","email":"anthosdel@yahoo.it"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Antonio M Dell'Anna, MD","affiliation":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.
