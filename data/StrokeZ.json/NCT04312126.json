Consolidation of a motor skill is dependent upon sleep. Some research shows that daytime naps improve people s motor performance and memory retention. Researchers want to find out how daytime naps may contribute to learning and support consolidation of motor skill memories.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn the role of memory replay during wakeful rest and sleep (naps) in retaining a newly learned skill.\n\nEligibility:\n\nEnglish-speaking adults ages 18 and older with chronic stroke, or healthy, right-handed, English-speaking adults ages 18-35 and 50-80\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* medical history\n* neurological history\n* medicine review\n* medical exam\n* neurological exam.\n\nParticipants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. For this, they will lie down in a scanner. The scanner makes loud noises, so they will wear earplugs. They will fill out an MRI screening form before each MRI.\n\nParticipants will also have magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG maps brain activity. It does this by recording the magnetic fields produced by naturally occurring electrical currents in the brain. For MEG, participants will lie down in the MEG room. Their eye movements may be recorded by a video camera.\n\nParticipants will have behavior testing. They will practice typing random keys. Then they will repeatedly type a custom sequence that they see on a computer screen. Then they will take a 2-hour nap. Then they will type the same sequence again.\n\nParticipants will have no more than 4 visits at the NIH over 3 months. Visits will last 2-4 hours each.","detailedDescription":"Study Description:\n\nWe will investigate sleep neural replay to motor skill consolidation in three groups: (a) young healthy subjects, (b) older healthy subjects and (c) patients with chronic stroke.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary aim is to determine the relative contribution of neural replay during wakeful rest and sleep to consolidation of a newly learned skill in young and older healthy volunteers, and in chronic stroke patients with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The secondary aim is to evaluate differences in replay rates between these subject cohorts. We will also explore differences in replay rates, spatiotemporal dynamics of neural replay and sleep spindles to generate additional hypotheses and preliminary data for future studies.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThe primary endpoint measure is motor skill consolidation (i.e., offline change in correct sequence typing speed following a nap). The secondary endpoint measure is neural replay rate. Exploratory endpoints measures are spatial (i.e. - parcellated source space) and time-frequency maps of neural replay during wakeful rest and sleep, and changes in button-press finger movement kinematics during learning."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Motor Skill","Sleep","Neural Replay","Natural History"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":174,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","description":"46 healthy young (18-35) volunteers"},{"label":"Arm 2","description":"46 healthy older (50-80) volunteers"},{"label":"Arm 3","description":"46 chronic (\\>6 months post-stroke) stroke patients","interventionNames":["Device: MRI system","Device: MEG system"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MRI system","description":"MRI system -
