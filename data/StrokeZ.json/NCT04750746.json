Stoke impact the life of a person significantly including the quality of life of an individual and especially performing the task of daily activities independently. About 50% survival of stroke have daily life activity limitation which is affecting their quality of life. Among stroke patients, 69% experience functional motor disturbance in their upper extremity.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Exer-gaming by using the Xbox Kinect game system on upper extremity motor functions and the ability to perform ADLs in sub-acute stroke. Various treatment methods are used for the rehabilitation of stroke. This study will be a randomized controlled trial, used to compare the effectiveness of Exer gaming on upper extremity function and activities of daily living in sub-acute stroke patient. Subjects with Sub-acute stroke meeting the predetermined inclusion \\& exclusion criteria will be divided into two groups using simple random sampling technique. Pre assessment will be done using FMA \\& SIS measurements. Subjects in one group will be treated with Conventional therapy and exer gaming and the other will be treated with conventional therapy and activities training session. Each subject will be received a total 18 treatment sessions, with 3 treatment sessions per week for 6 weeks. Post treatment reading for FMA and SIS will be recorded after the end of treatment session. Recorded values will be analyzed for any change using SPSS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cardiovascular Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Control group will get conventional treatment.","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]},{"label":"Experimental Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will get base line treatment with exer gaming.","interventionNames":["Other: Experimental Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"Conventional Therapy Passive ROM and/or AROM exercises Muscle strengthening; Therapeutics stretching of the shoulder, the elbow, the wrist, and the fingers.
