Patients with acute ischemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion presenting within 24 hours will be randomized 1:1 to intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg) ± thrombectomy or 'best practice'which may be alteplase (0.9mg/kg) within 4.5 hours from stroke onset or standard care (no lysis) ± thrombectomy at treating clinician's discretion.","detailedDescription":"The study will be a multicentre, prospective, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), randomized controlled trial (2 arm with 1:1 randomization) in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion presenting to hospital within 24 hours of symptom onset.\n\nPatients will be required to have complete or partial occlusion of the basilar artery on baseline computed tomography angiography (CTA)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), defined as 'potentially retrievable' thrombus in the basilar artery. Thrombectomy is permitted within 24 hours as part of standard care but is not mandatory.\n\nPatients will be randomized to treatment with either standard of care (no intravenous thrombolytic treatment or intravenous alteplase 0.9mg/kg within 4.5 hours from stroke onset) or intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg). Time of onset of symptoms is defined as described by the patient or witness; if unknown, it is considered to be the last time the patient was seen well. In patients presenting with mild (e.g. vertigo, dizziness, headache, diplopia, dysarthria) stuttering symptoms followed by sudden onset of clinical deterioration with decrease in conscious state or moderate to severe motor deficits, the time of deterioration in clinical state is taken as the estimated time of basilar artery occlusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["rhTNK-tPA","rt-PA","Ischemic stroke","phase III trial","basilar artery occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":452,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg) within 24 hours ± thrombectomy at treating clinician's discretion","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase"]},{"label":"Best Practice (which may include intravenous Alteplase)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous alteplase (0.9mg/kg) within 4.5 hours from stroke onset or standard care (no lysis) ± thrombectomy at treating clinician's discretion","interventionNames":["Drug: Best Practice (which may include intravenous Alteplase)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase","description":"Intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg, administered as a bolus within 5-10 seconds) within 24 hours ± thrombectomy at treating clinician's discretion","armGroupLabels":["Tenecteplase"],"otherNames":["rhTNK-tPA","TNK-tPA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Best Practice (which may include intravenous Alteplase)","description":"Intravenous alteplase (0.9mg/kg) within 4.5 hours from stroke onset or standard care (no lysis) ± thrombectomy at treating clinician's discretion","armGroupLabels":["Best Practice (which may include intravenous Alteplase)"],"otherNames":["rt-PA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 or return to baseline mRS","description":"The proportion of patients with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 (no disability) or return to baseline mRS (if baseline premorbid mRS =2-3) at 3 months.
