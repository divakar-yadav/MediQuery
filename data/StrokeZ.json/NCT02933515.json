To address this long-term goal, this team previously developed and pilot-tested a therapeutic yoga intervention to improve balance, balance self-efficacy, and fear of falling and a group OT intervention to improve the management of fall risk factors and fear of falling. The success of both prior studies supports Merging Yoga and group OT to improve balance, balance self-efficacy, and fall risk factor management. The objectives of this feasibility study are to 1) further develop, standardize, and manualize the MY-OT intervention and 2) assess change in balance, balance self-efficacy, and fall risk factor management.","detailedDescription":"8 week intervention of yoga plus occupational therapy.
