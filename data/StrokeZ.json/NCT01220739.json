Treatment with IV rt-PA must begin within 3 hours of symptom onset, and the initiation of TLT procedure must be feasible for each subject within 6 hours of stroke onset. The NeuroTheraÂ® Laser System is an investigational device that provides noninvasive transcranial laser therapy to subjects diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. The wavelength of the laser light is in the infrared zone of the electromagnetic spectrum and is invisible to the naked eye.","detailedDescription":"This study is a phase II (n= 200), prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter, safety study of intravenous (IV) rt-PA alone versus IV rt-PA plus TLT (Transcranial Laser Therapy) at approximately 10 investigational sites (United States only). The primary endpoint for this safety study is occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages at 36 - 48 hours after stroke symptom onset.\n\nSymptomatic hemorrhage will be defined as deterioration of more than 4 points on the NIHSS lasting at least 72 hours accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage in the distribution of the neurological deficit as identified by neuroimaging scans. All follow up neuroimaging scans will be reviewed centrally by an independent reviewer for the presence or absence of hemorrhage on the 36-48 hour scan.\n\nThe secondary endpoints for this study are as follows:\n\n* Hemorrhagic transformation without clinical consequences (asymptomatic) within 36-48 hours. All follow-up neuroimaging scans will be reviewed centrally by an independent reviewer for the presence or absence of hemorrhage on the 36-48 hour scan.\n* Mortality\n* The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score dichotomized as 0-1 versus an mRS score of 2-6 at 90 days or the last rating in patients that develop intracerebral hemorrhages\n* Frequency of SAEs and AEs This study is a phase II (N = 200), prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham controlled, multicenter, safety study of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) versus IV rt-PA plus transcranial laser therapy (TLT) at approximately 10 investigational sites.\n\nThe study population will be randomized into two arms. One group will receive a sham TLT procedure (Sham Control Group or SCG) and the second group will receive an active TLT procedure (TLTG).\n\nThe randomization ratio of SCG and TLTG will be 1:1 and will be stratified in order to ensure balanced subject distribution between the treatment and sham-controlled groups for the following factors:\n\n* Stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline (stratified as 7-9, 10-13, 14-17)\n* Study Site There are 6 visits in the study. The purpose of the Visit 1 will be to determine and confirm the eligibility of patients for participation in the StELLAR Study and document baseline information about the subject and their stroke event. This will include all of the following standard of care tests and procedures: a non contrast head CT scan performed prior to rt-PA administration, vital signs, height , weight ,physical exam, finger stick or blood glucose, serum or urine pregnancy test (if women of childbearing potential). In addition, the following data will be obtained: prestroke mRS, NIHSS, presumed location of stroke and vascular territory, start and stop date and time of the IV rt-PA treatment and dose given, date and time of stroke onset, date and time of arrival to the hospital, demographic data (date of birth, gender, ethnicity),sociodemographic data (education, marital status, social support prior to stroke),medical and surgical history (specific cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, and other standard questions asked), method of contraception use (for women of child bearing potential), prior (three days prior to Screening) and current concomitant medication use, smoking history, adverse events from the time of obtaining informed consent. To be eligible for the study, the administration of rt-PA should follow the guidelines outlined by the National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders. Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study after written informed consent is obtained by the patient or their legally authorized representative."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","transcranial laser","tissue plasminogen activator","therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IV tPA + Sham Transcranial Laser Therapy","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects in this treatment arm will receive IV tPA within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset followed by sham transcranial laser therapy no sooner than 12 hours after tPA and no greater than 24 hours from stroke onset.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Laser Therapy"]},{"label":"IV tPA +Transcranial Laser Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects in this treatment arm will receive IV tPA within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset followed by transcranial laser therapy no sooner than 12 hours after tPA and no greater than 24 hours from stroke onset.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Laser Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Laser Therapy","description":"Transcranial laser therapy is administered with the NeuroTheraÂ® Laser System (NTS) in subjects diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.

Subject is at least 40 years of age at screening, but has not had their 81st birthday.\n2. Subject has received IV rt-PA per the NINDS rt-PA Protocol Guidelines within 3 hours of symptom onset for an acute ischemic stroke.\n3. Subject is diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and presents to the health care facility at a time such that initiation of NTS procedure is feasible within 6 hours of the time of stroke onset. The time of stroke onset is defined as the time at which a change in the baseline neurological function occurred. If the time is not known (e.g., the subject awakens from sleep with new symptoms), the last time the patient was observed to be neurologically intact must be considered to be the time of onset.\n4. Documented baseline NIHSS score of \\> 7 and \\< 17 prior to IV rt-PA administration. Subjects who transfer from other facilities after receiving IV rt-PA must have a documented NIHSS by a certified examiner prior to initiation of rt-PA treatment. Documentation of NIHSS score via telemedicine is acceptable if performed by a certified examiner. Subjects who improve prior to NTS procedure will still be treated, unless their NIHSS improves to 0.\n5. Full functional independence just prior to the present stroke episode as defined by the following criteria:\n\n   * Estimated prestroke mRS score 0 or 1.\n   * Ambulates independently, may need a cane or walker, but does not need the assistance of another person.\n   * Absence of a medical/physical/mental condition that substantially limits the subject's ability to work, study, participate in leisure activities, or look after family at home\n   * Completely independent, does not need supervision (may live with other individuals, but could live alone if necessary)\n6.
