It's prevalence varies between studies, probably because it includes many etiologies and there is no one way of diagnosis.\n\nHSP delays rehabilitation, elongates hospitalization time and reduces quality of life.\n\nCurrently there is no one reccomended treatment for HSP. Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces persisting excitability changes in the human motor cortex. this effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation. Interacting with cortical activity, by means of cortical stimulation, can improve the rehabilitation potential of neurologic patients. In this respect, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical stimulation may play a role in treating aphasia, unilateral neglect, and chronic pain disorders.\n\nIn this tDCS study the investigator uses one anode and one cathode electrode placed over the scalp to modulate a particular area of the central nervous system (CNS). The stimulation is administered via the neuroConn DC.Stimulator. The DC-STIMULATOR is a micro-processor-controlled constant current source. The DCSTIMULATOR is a CE-certified medical device for conducting non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on people.Electrode positioning is determined according to the International EEG 10-20 System."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain","transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Electrode positioning will be determined according to the EEG 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement: Affected hemisphere anodal stimulation of the hand area of the primary motor cortex (C3/C4), Intensity of 2 mA (milliampere) for duration of 20 minutes.
