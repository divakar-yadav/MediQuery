The first strategy is associated to the ability to apply efficient organizational semantic category strategy to a list of words. This strategy will be trained in activities similar to everyday life activities. There will be in total 5 sessions, two for measuring the generalization effects before and after training and three sessions to apply the semantic strategy in order to improve encoding and episodic memory performance. The second strategy is related to the ability to remember face-names and the strategy will involve the identification of a salient face feature, creation of a nickname and association of the nickname to the real name. There will be 5 sessions in total, two for measuring the generalization effects before and after training and three sessions to apply the face-name association strategy in order to improve encoding and episodic memory performance. These two cognitive training procedures will be carried out in two separate moments. Before and after each procedure all participants will be examined by functional MRI during resting state and during a active task using a memory encoding paradigm. The same procedure will be carried out with normal control participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vascular Diseases"],"keywords":["vascular ischemic lesion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cognitive training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Semantic categorization training sessions","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Cognitive training"]},{"label":"Control condition","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Five sessions of behavioral control condition with information and education","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Control Condition"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Cognitive training","description":"Five sessions of semantic strategy training and face-name association training","armGroupLabels":["Cognitive training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Control Condition","description":"Five sessions of active control information and education","armGroupLabels":["Control condition"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline memory performance at 6 months","description":"Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (episodic memory test total immediate score 48 and delayed score12) and fMRI active task (news recall immediate and delayed score 12)","timeFrame":"up to 24 weeks after intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline everyday life activity performance at 6 months","description":"Generalization questionnaire (questions on difficulties in everyday memory total score 12)","timeFrame":"up to 24 weeks of intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* people with chronic vascular ischemic lesions (more than 6 months)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* vascular hemorrhages, stenosis, psychiatric problems","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Eliane C Miotto, PhD","affiliation":"University of Sao Paulo","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Sao Paulo","city":"S達o Paulo","state":"Sao Paulo","zip":"05403000","country":"Brazil","geoPoint":{"lat":-23.5475,"lon":-46.63611}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35349186","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Gibson E, Koh CL, Eames S, Bennett S, Scott AM, Hoffmann TC.
