Although this paper studies able-bodied individuals, similar rTMS protocols are used to facilitate motor recovery in patients with hemiplegia following stroke. However, the cortical mechanisms associated with repeated daily doses of rTMS are not completely understood."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Accident","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Primed rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receive 10 min. of 6-Hz rTMS Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation at 90% RMT (3,600 pulses).
