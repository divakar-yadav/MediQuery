The HeadPoS study revealed that there is no significant difference in disability outcomes between patients who are placed in a lying-flat position for 24 hours and those who are placed in a sitting-up position with the head elevated to at least 30 degrees for 24 hours. However, this study included both patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and most of the patients had mild strokes (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 4). It is unclear how to arrange the patient's head position after endovascular treatment.\n\nThe hypothesis of this trial: Compared with the lying flat head positioni, the head elevation position after endovascular treatment can significantly improve the 90-day functional outcome of acute large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Endovascular Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1332,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The lying flat group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in lying flat intervention to be nursed lying flat (0°) after endovascular therapy is made and to remain in this position for 72 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: The lying flat (0°) head position for 72 hours"]},{"label":"The head elevation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in the sitting up intervention should be nursed with their head elevated (30°) by raising the head of the bed (or using extra pillows or wedges) after undergoing endovascular therapy, and to remain in this position for 72 hours.","interventionNames":["Other: The The head elevation (30°) position for 72 hours"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"The lying flat (0°) head position for 72 hours","description":"The lying flat (0°) head position for 72 hours after endovascular therapy.","armGroupLabels":["The lying flat group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"The The head elevation (30°) position for 72 hours","description":"The head elevoatin (30°) position for 72 hours after endovascular therapy.","armGroupLabels":["The head elevation group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale score (mRS)","description":"disability level.
