The investigators hypothesize that patients will increase their use of compensatory strategies following this rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"The principal aim of this study is to evaluate changes in strategies of hemiparetic upper limb movement in chronic stroke patients following twelve one hour sessions of rehabilitation using the \"Nintendo Wii\" over a period of four weeks, and to compare with a group of patients receiving traditional upper limb rehabilitation of the same duration. The investigators hypothesize that the use of compensatory strategies will increase in the group receiving the \"Wii\" rehabilitation while they will decrease in the group receiving traditional rehabilitation. The investigators further hypothesize that this will have an impact on the functional benefit with a greater improvement of function in the group receiving traditional rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Hemiparetic Patients (at Least 6 Months Post Stroke)","Age Between 18-75 Years"],"keywords":["Hemiparesis,","Rehabilitation,","WII,","Upper limb,","Movement strategies."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rehabilitation using Nintendo-Wii","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"30 patients will receive rehabilitation using Nintendo-Wii.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: WII Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Traditional physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"30 patients will receive traditional physiotherapy.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Traditional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"WII Rehabilitation","description":"30 patients will receive \"Wii\" rehabilitation of 15 minutes (tennis, boxing and golf), in comparison with 10 healthy subjects.","armGroupLabels":["Rehabilitation using Nintendo-Wii"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Traditional rehabilitation","description":"30 patients will receive the traditional rehabilitation.","armGroupLabels":["Traditional physiotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Degree of elbow extension during an active reaching task","timeFrame":"6 minutes"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical","description":"Pain (VAS) (evaluated at the beginning and end of each session) Borg scale of perceived effort (evaluated at the end of each session) Fugl-Meyer (upper limb section) (evaluated before and after the rehabilitation period) Box and Block test (evaluated before and after the rehabilitation period) Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) (evaluated before and after the rehabilitation period) Motor Activity Log (MAL) (evaluated before and after the rehabilitation period) Stroke Impact scale (SIS) (evaluated before and after the rehabilitation period) Satisfaction (VAS) (evaluated at the end of the rehabilitation period)","timeFrame":"1 hour and half"},{"measure":"Kinematic measures","description":"Parameters relating to hand trajectory (smoothness, curvature, velocity) and upper limb joint angles (trunk flexion, shoulder abduction) during an active reaching task using an electromagnetic motion capture system.
