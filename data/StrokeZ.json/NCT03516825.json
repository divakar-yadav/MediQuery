The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate and carry-over effect of Musical Neglect Training on unilateral visual neglect. Standardized assessments (Albert's test and Line Bisection Test) were used to measure a range of visual field. A total of 6 musical exercises with tone bars which are aligned horizontally helped to improve attention and perception of the visual field on the left side.","detailedDescription":"Unilateral visual neglect from right hemisphere stroke is a condition that reduces a person's ability to attend to and process stimuli in one half, mostly left side, of their environment. This perceptual processing deficit can negatively affect individuals' daily living which in turn reduces functional independence. Music has been used as a therapeutic tool in a variety of settings to promote cognitive functions. In particular, music has been used to improve attention in the left sides for patients with visual neglect. Musical Neglect Training (MNT) has been developed for patients with visual neglect to improve attention in the left side.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the immediate and longer-lasting effect of Musical Neglect Training (MNT) on unilateral visual neglect. A single-subject design was used, as participants served as their own control. Two individuals participated in this study. Participants underwent six individual MNT sessions. MNT uses musical exercises which are structured in pitch, time and tempo, and musical equipment (tone bars, keyboards, drums) configures to focus attention to the neglect visual field. Two standardized assessments (Albert's and Line Bisection Test) were used. The assessments were administered immediately before and after each of the 6 MNT sessions to assess the immediate effect of MNT. Moreover, follow-up testing was done one week after their 6th session to examine the longer-lasting effects of MNT. Paired t-test was used to examine the immediate effect, and both participants showed significant improvement with Albert's Test in immediate effect."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemispatial Neglect"],"keywords":["Musical Neglect Training","Neurologic Music Therapy","unilateral visual neglect","hemispatial neglect","stroke","spatial perception and attention","music therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"The same intervention has been used for all participants (two) for this study.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"All participants were given no information about this intervention.
