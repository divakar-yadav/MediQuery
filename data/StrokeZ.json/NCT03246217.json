This research explores the hypothesis that use of these shared neural networks allows neurologic music therapy interventions targeting upper extremity motor control to promote plasticity and functional improvements in persons recovering from a cerebrovascular accident. The potential therapeutic benefits of these interventions on attentional processes and affective responding will also be examined.","detailedDescription":"More individuals are surviving and living with the effects of stroke, a trend that is expected to continue. Upper extremity limitations present a common, persistent challenge for stroke survivors, impacting quality of life. In addition, links have been found between physical impairment and depression, and depression and stroke-induced cognitive impairment. Music has been shown to exert multimodal effects on individuals and may be used as a mediating stimulus to promote therapeutic change. Furthermore, motor imagery may enhance the effectiveness of upper extremity interventions by engaging the same brain areas that are active in physical movement. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of therapeutic instrumental music performance and sensory-enhanced motor imagery on upper limb movement, affect and cognition following a stroke. Participants will be assessed at two baselines, and randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: therapeutic instrumental music performance, therapeutic instrumental music performance and sensory-enhanced motor imagery, or therapeutic instrumental music performance and motor imagery without sensory enhancement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance is a Neurologic Music Therapy technique in which selection of instruments, spatial configurations and sequences for playing are designed to facilitate retraining of movement patterns used in everyday life.
