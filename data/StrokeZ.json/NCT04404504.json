The triage stroke-score FAST-ED (Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination), as well as the expected time of arrival will be transmitted by an additional smartphone-app in advance of the arrival (Join, Allm). Patients will receive emergency workup to identify stroke etiology and presence of large vessel occlusion. Final diagnosis, presence of large vessel occlusion and type of revascularisation treatment will be registered. Sensitivity, specificity and further criteria for test quality will be calculated for the stroke triage by emergency service in field using the FAST-ED."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["Prehospital Triage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Presence of large vessel occlusion","description":"Acute stroke due to large vessel occlusion as measured by computed tomography angiography (CT-A)","timeFrame":"Baseline"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"All patients above the age of 18 with suspected acute stroke transferred to the university hospital Essen.\n\nInclusion criteria: suspected acute stroke, age above 18 years and a digitally transmitted FAST-ED by EMS prior to admission.\n\nExclusion criteria: Known symptom onset beyond 24 Hours.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All adult patients with suspected acute stroke that are transferred by the Essen emergency service to the university hospital Essen shall be recruited","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Martin Köhrmann, Prof. Dr.","affiliation":"University Hospital, Essen","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital, Essen","city":"Essen","state":"NRW","zip":"45147","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":51.45657,"lon":7.01228}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34804205","type":"RESULT","citation":"Frank B, Lembeck T, Toppe N, Brune B, Bozkurt B, Deuschl C, Nogueira RG, Dudda M, Risse J, Kill C, Forsting M, Kleinschnitz C, Kohrmann M.
