Both the drugs were approved by the Japanese Government, and have frequently been used for the treatment of acute brain infarction in Japan. The effect of combination therapy of these drugs, however, has not yet been elucidated. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with these agents in patients with acute non-cardioembolic and non-lacunar ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Free Radical Scavenger","Selective Thrombin Inhibitor","Acute ischemic stroke (nonlacunar and noncardioembolic)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":814,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The patients who are allocated to Argatroban monotherapy","interventionNames":["Drug: Edaravone"]},{"label":"B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The patients who are allocated to Edaravone-Argatroban combination therapy","interventionNames":["Drug: Edaravone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Edaravone","description":"30mg/20mL vial, twice per day, not longer than two weeks","armGroupLabels":["A","B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score","timeFrame":"at 3 months"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","timeFrame":"for the initial 3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS score, JSS score, Barthel Index, modified Rankin Scale score","timeFrame":"at various time-points"},{"measure":"Various adverse effects","timeFrame":"for the 3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke \\< 24 hours of onset\n* Measurable neurological deficits caused by the present attack, ranging from 1 to 22 of NIHSS score on admission\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Definite or possible cardiogenic brain infarction\n* Definite lacunar infarction\n* Prior ischemic stroke within 6 months\n* Evidence of hemorrhagic brain infarction, epidural hematoma, intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage\n* Severe consciousness disturbances (semicoma to deep coma)\n* Neurological signs clearing spontaneously\n* Disability of 2 or more on mRS score before the index stroke aPTT being out of the normal range or 1.5 times longer than the pretreatment value\n* If taking an oral anticoagulant, INR being 1.6 or more, or no INR data\n* Treatment with urokinase, t-PA, heparin, ozagrel sodium, warfarin, or antiplatelet except for aspirin before enrollment\n* Intravascular surgery, surgical operation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or hypothermia therapy before enrollment\n* Serum creatinine \\>1.5 mg/dL\n* Severe hepatic or cardiac disorders, infectious disorders, dehydration, etc.\n* Neoplasm\n* Pregnancy\n* Hypersensitivity to test drugs","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Takenori Yamaguchi, MD, PhD","affiliation":"National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Japan","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"},{"name":"Takenori Yamaguchi, MD, PhD","affiliation":"National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Japan","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"EAST Study Office c/o National Cardiovascular Center","city":"Suita","state":"Osaka","zip":"565-8565","country":"Japan","geoPoint":{"lat":34.76143,"lon":135.51567}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"12074843","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Jin YJ, Mima T, Raicu V, Park KC, Shimizu K.
