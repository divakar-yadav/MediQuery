The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of intravenous thrombolysis with Tenecteplase (TNK) versus placebo in patients who suffer a non-large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke between 4.5 and 12 hours from time last seen well (TLSW) and with a clinical-radiological mismatch or evidence of salvageable brain tissue on perfusion imaging. Randomization will be done under a minimization process using age (≤70 vs. \\>70 years), baseline NIHSS (≤10 vs. \\>10), therapeutic window (4.5-9 or 9-12 hours after TLKW), randomization scenario and clinical site.
