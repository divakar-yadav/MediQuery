The conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system is associated with inflammatory reaction, hemolysis, hemodilution an disturbances of the blood coagulation system. Also it's well known that neurological disturbances caused by embolic material and air bubbles are potential risks of CPB. The new minimized perfusion circuit ROCsafeTM is a closed, reservoir-less, reduced prime, surface coated circuit, with optimized safety features in effectively eliminate both macro and micro air bubbles and should optimize the clinical outcome after CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease","Acute Cerebrovascular Accident","Intracranial
