Elevated troponin indicates increased mortality in stroke patients. There is currently little evidence regarding the ideal care of these patients. The investigators know from previous studies that approximately 25% of acute stroke patients with elevated levels of cardiac troponin have culprit lesions on coronary angiogram.\n\nThe primary goal of the PRAISE study is to develop a diagnostic algorithm that allows the prediction of acute coronary syndrome in stroke patients. To achieve this, clinical symptoms, troponin levels as well as findings on EKG, echocardiography and coronary angiography will be systematically evaluated. The PRAISE study is a multicenter study with more than 20 sites in Germany. Joint funding will be provided by DZHK (German center of cardiovascular research) und DZNE (German center of neurodegenerative diseases). Acute ischaemic stroke patients with elevated troponin are eligible for participation in the study. The primary endpoint is the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome as established by an independent endpoint committee."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Acute Coronary Syndrome"],"keywords":["stroke","troponin","acute coronary syndrome","culprit lesion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":251,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients with elevated troponin","description":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke (confirmed by cerebral imaging) and cardiac troponin values \\> 52 ng/l or troponin values \\> 14 ng/l and dynamic change \\> 20% will undergo coronary angiography","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Coronary angiography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Coronary angiography","description":"In patients eligible for participation in the study coronary angiography, echocardiography and EKG will be performed systematically.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients with elevated troponin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"presence of acute coronary syndrome","description":"the diagnosis will be established by an independent endpoint committee","timeFrame":"within seven days of admission to hospital"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mortality","description":"mortality will be recorded during the stay in hospital as well as after three and twelve months","timeFrame":"at one week and at three and twelve months after the initial event"},{"measure":"functional outcome","description":"functional outcome will be evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (0-6 with greater scores indicating poorer functional outcome)","timeFrame":"at baseline, at one week and at three and twelve months after the initial event"},{"measure":"cardiovascular events","description":"cardiovascular events include new stroke, transient ischemic attack and myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"at one week and at three and twelve months after the initial event"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* diagnosis of ischemic stroke based on clinical and imaging information (CT or MRI)\n* diagnosis of transient ischemic attack if the initial focal neurological deficit has been examined by a neurologist and if the ABCD2-score is ≥ 4\n* Elevation of high-sensitive cardiac troponins according to the rule-in/rule-out algorithm of the 2015 ESC guidelines for NSTE-ACS, i.e. highly abnormal troponin at 0 hours (\\> 52ng/l if hs-cTnT, Elecsys-Assay, or \\> 52ng/l, if hs-cTnI; Architect-Assay, or \\> 107 ng/l, if hs-cTnI.
