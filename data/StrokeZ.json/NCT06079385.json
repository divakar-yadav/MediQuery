Additionally, the goal is to reduce the need for multiple medications and/or high-dose drug usage in the treatment of these complications in patients","detailedDescription":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of acupuncture therapy on sleep quality in patients experiencing insomnia in the early post-stroke period. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind study, 70 ischemic stroke patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation were included. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: the acupuncture group receiving acupuncture therapy and standard rehabilitation program. The control group receiving only the standard rehabilitation program. The acupuncture group received acupuncture treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI scores were assessed three times at baseline, at the 4th week, and at the 8th week. The results of the study indicated that the acupuncture group demonstrated a significant improvement in sleep quality compared to the control group. Significant differences were observed between the baseline PSQI scores and the PSQI scores at the 4th week in both the acupuncture and control groups (p: 0.000 and p: 0.008). The change between baseline and 8th-week PSQI scores was also significant (p: 0.000 and p: 0.000). However, in the acupuncture group, the decrease in PSQI scores was significantly greater compared to the control group. The addition of acupuncture therapy to standard treatment resulted in a significant improvement in sleep quality. Additionally, the baseline PSQI scores were found to be correlated with the severity of depression.This study suggests that acupuncture therapy can be an effective intervention for improving sleep quality in patients with early post-stroke insomnia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Complementary"],"keywords":["acupuncture","sleep medicine","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acupuncture group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients who received acupuncture treatment in addition to a standard rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Other: Acupuncture treatment"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The patients who received the standard rehabilitation program."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Acupuncture treatment","description":"Acupuncture treatment with needles","armGroupLabels":["Acupuncture group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index","description":"The index helps to evaluate sleep quality of patient.
