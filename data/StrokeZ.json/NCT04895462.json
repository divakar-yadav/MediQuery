Taking into account its limitations, some studies documented higher rates of endovascular treatment complications such as clot fragmentation with distal embolization and vessel re-oclusion, to be more difficult to achieve recanalization after endovascular treatment, and higher rates of any intracerebral hemmorhage.\n\nThe investigators aim is to assess in a large, multicenter and international cohort, the safety and outcomes of acute reperfusion therapies in patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19, by comparison with a contemporary control group of patients with ischemic stroke and without COVID-19 from the same centers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Covid19"],"keywords":["Intravenous thrombolysis","Endovascular treatment","Mechanical thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15128,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Stroke and COVID-19","description":"Ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19 receiving acute recanalization treatment (intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular treatment)"},{"label":"Control group: Ischemic Stroke without COVID-19","description":"Ischemic stroke patients without COVID-19 receiving acute recanalization treatment (intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular treatment)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","description":"Symptomatic parenchymal hemorrhagic transformation according to the ECASS-2 (European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study - II) definition, and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage with ≥4-point worsening in NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale)","timeFrame":"36 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of any hemorrhagic transformation","description":"According to the ECASS-2 (European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study - II) definition","timeFrame":"36 hours"},{"measure":"Rate of recanalization after endovascular treatment measured by mTICI (modified treatment in cerebral infarction)","description":"Only in EVT patients","timeFrame":"End of procedure"},{"measure":"Rate of successful recanalization after endovascular treatment (defined as final mTICI [modified treatment in cerebral infarction] ≥2b)","description":"Only in EVT patients","timeFrame":"End of procedure"},{"measure":"Number of passes during endovascular treatment","description":"Only in EVT patients","timeFrame":"End of procedure"},{"measure":"Rate of first pass effect during endovascular treatment","description":"Only in EVT patients","timeFrame":"End of procedure"},{"measure":"Rate of procedural complication (Arterial perforation, embolization into a previously non-ischemic territory, and re-occlusion)","description":"Only in EVT patients","timeFrame":"End of procedure"},{"measure":"Delta NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) at 24 hours","description":"Difference between admission NIHSS and NIHSS at 24 hours.
