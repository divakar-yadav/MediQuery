Endovascular clot removal is a breakthrough therapy for large vessel occlusion (LVO) AIS. Pre-stroke disabled patients were excluded from pivotal EVT stroke trials, so whether EVT is effective for those with pre-stroke disability is not known. As a result, two competing, widely-practiced, treatment paradigms have emerged based on individual practitioners' extrapolation of EVT benefits and safety from patients without a pre-stroke disability to those with disability: 1) Multimodal Medical Management (MMM; using intravenous thrombolysis, antiplatelets, anti-hypertensives, cholesterol lowering medications, and other rehabilitative measures, as indicated) without EVT, and 2) EVT with the background of MMM.\n\nTESTED will enroll patients with LVO-AIS who have a pre-existing disability, defined as pre-stroke modified Rankin score (mRS) 3 and 4, at 12 geographically distinct comprehensive stroke centers serving diverse race-ethnic and socioeconomic populations. The central objective of TESTED is to determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of these two different practice paradigms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1060,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients with moderate-to-severe pre-stroke disability","description":"Patients with pre-stroke modified Rankin scale score 3 or 4, presenting with a anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke within 24 hours of last known well","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular Stroke Treatment","Other: Medical Management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular Stroke Treatment","description":"Patients who receive endovascular stroke treatment when they are admitted into the hospital, as determined by their clinical care team.
