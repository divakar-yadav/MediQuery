All subjects will go through four conditions of transcranial direct current stimulation with for 30 minutes. Four conditions are 1) bihemispheric stimulation - anodal stimulation on both ipsilesional and contralesional leg area of primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. 2) ipsilesional stimulation - anodal stimulation on ipsilesional leg area of primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. 3) contralesional stimulation - anodal stimulation on contralesional leg area of primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. 4) sham stimulation. Subjects will walk on treadmill for 10 minutes during transcranial direct current stimulation. Motor evoked potential and functional evaluations will be done before and after stimulation to measure the changes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait Disorders, Neurologic"],"keywords":["transcranial direct current stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bihemispheric stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
