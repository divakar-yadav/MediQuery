The causes are stiffness, CRPS, and frozen shoulder. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between frozen shoulder and shoulder LOM in patients with cerebral infarction using ultrasonography.","detailedDescription":"Ultrasound examination was performed on 50 patients with limited range of motion of the shoulder joint among inpatients or outpatients in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of our hospital, who had a stroke of fewer than 2 years, and the findings suitable for adhesive capsulitis, namely the thickness of the joint capsule in the axillary concave Identify those with thickened findings. Their shoulder power rating, passive range of motion, stiffness evaluation (Modified Ashworth Scale, MAS), and the presence or absence of Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) were evaluated, and the relationship with ultrasound findings was investigated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke","Frozen Shoulder"],"keywords":["Cerebral Stroke","Frozen Shoulder","ultrasonography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group","description":"Stroke patients with limitation of range of motion on the affected shoulder.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Ultrasonography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Ultrasonography","description":"The ultrasound measurement s of the axillary recess capsule thickness.","armGroupLabels":["Study group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Range of motion of shoulder joint","description":"A goniometer is an instrument which measures the available range of motion at a joint.Flexion, Extension,Adduction,Abduction, Internal Rotation,External rotation","timeFrame":"day 1"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MAS(Modified Ashworth Scale) of elbow Flexor","description":"The Modified Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity.
