The intervention will include training of three items from the Wolf motor function test in random order (high CI group) or block order (low CI group). Outcomes of engagement will include the brain engagement index, heart rate variability and galvanic skin response. Outcomes of learning will include the pre-post change in performance of the wolf motor function selected items.","detailedDescription":"The aim of the study is to examine associations between contextual interference (CI), engagement during practice, and changes in upper limb motor performance among patients post-stroke.\n\nFifty patients over the age of 18, after a stroke, in the sub-acute and early chronic stages who are treated in a rehabilitation center inpatient or outpatient clinics, who have hemiparesis (Fugl-Meyer score = 11-60) will be recruited.\n\nPatients with a history of neurological diseases other than stroke or orthopedics conditions that impair upper extremity function, pain that prevents active movement, hemodynamic instability, cognitive decline and language difficulties that do not allow understanding of instructions and cooperation will be excluded.\n\nThe study will include participation in five sessions. In the first session, participants will answer a demographic questionnaire and a set of motor (including the Wolf motor function test), perception and cognitive tests will be delivered. Then participants will be assigned to either high or low CI groups. In the next three sessions, participants will practice three items from the Wolf motor functions test. Participants in the high CI group will practice the items in random order and those in the low CI group will practice the selected items in blocked order. Assessment of outcomes during practice will include assessment of brain engagement index by recording EEG (one electrode) and heart rate variability and galvanic skin response. In the fifth session, at the end of the intervention, a reassessment of the wolf motor function performance will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study will be a randomized controlled trial with a pre-post design.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Masking description: The outcome assessor will be blind to the group assignment of the participants.
