METHODS: All patients seen at the Ottawa Hospital Stroke Prevention Clinic were screened for smoking status, advised to quit smoking and treated using a standardized protocol including counselling and pharmacotherapy. Eligible smokers were randomly assigned to either a prescription only usual care group, or, the experimental group who received a 4-week supply of cost-free quit smoking medications and prescription for medication renewal. All patients received follow-up counselling 7-days prior to and 5, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180 days following their quit attempt. Levels of eligibility, consent, adherence and retention were used as indicators of study feasibility. The primary outcome was bio-chemically validated quit rates at 26-weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke smoking cessation cost-free pharmacotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cost Free Pharmacotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants assigned to the CF group received a starter kit (4-week supply) of cost-free quit smoking medication (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline) and a pre-printed prescription to be filled by the patient at the end of the 4-weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: cost free pharmacotherapy"]},{"label":"Usual Care Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants assigned to the prescription only usual care group received a prescription for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to be filled at their own cost at their local community pharmacy.","interventionNames":["Other: usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"cost free pharmacotherapy","description":"Participants assigned to the CF group received a starter kit (4-week supply) of cost-free quit smoking medication (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline) and a pre-printed prescription to be filled by the patient at the end of the 4-weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Cost Free Pharmacotherapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"usual care","description":"Participants assigned to the prescription only usual care group received a prescription for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to be filled at their own cost at their local community pharmacy.","armGroupLabels":["Usual Care Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"smoking abstinence","description":"The dependent variables of primary interest were measured at 26 weeks and included: (1) bio-chemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence; and (2) continuous abstinence since TQD.
