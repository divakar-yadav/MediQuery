Rehabilitation is essential for the resumption of daily activities, and with the appropriate care, it is possible for stroke-survivors to regain most of their functions.\n\nHence, this study aims to better understand upper limb recovery covering different stages post-stroke in a representative cohort of Asian adults","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading contributor to disability in Singapore, partially driven by a reduced ability to use the upper limb in their daily lives. Reduced upper limb use commonly results from a variety of impairments such as motor, sensory and cognitive impairments.\n\nThe aim of this longitudinal and observational study is to gather a rich multi-modal database on the time-course of upper limb recovery in a representative cohort after stroke and characterise the relationship between upper limb recovery, common post-stroke impairments and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical and technological-aided assessments and questionnaires"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical and technological-aided assessments and questionnaires","description":"Assessments and questionnaires related to upper limb function and quality of life will be used","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)","description":"The FMA-UE is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
