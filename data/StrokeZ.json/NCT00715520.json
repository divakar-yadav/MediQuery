Once investigators have determined the improving effect of TMS and the drugs on learning of movement skills, the study team may be able to provide information that improves rehabilitative treatment and helps to improve recovery after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Previous studies have shown, that when patients learn a new motor movement, it may cause a change in the way the nerves act in the area of the brain that controls movement. This change is called use-dependent plasticity. The ability of that part of the brain, called the motor cortex (M1), to reorganize plays a major role in the recovery of motor deficits post-stroke; hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative strategies that utilize this potential for recovery. In this proposed study, investigators will further examine influences of use-dependent plasticity in the non-injured M1 of healthy subjects and injured M1 of stroke subjects using a combination of non-invasive cortical stimulation, medication, and exercise techniques. In Aim 1, investigators will test the effect of drugs that interact specifically with different neurotransmitter systems on use-dependent plasticity in intact M1 of healthy humans. In Aim 2, investigators will identify the parameters for non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 that are most effective to enhance use-dependent plasticity in intact healthy human M1. In Aim 3, investigators will test the drugs and rTMS protocols that were demonstrated to be most effective to enhance use- dependent plasticity in the Specific Aim 1 and 2 and apply them to participants who have experienced a stroke. Results from this study will help to inform future research about the efficacy of plasticity enhancing methods in injured M1 of stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Rehabilitation","Stroke","Plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aim 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Healthy adult female and male subjects will receive study drugs and TMS training to measure M1 excitability.","interventionNames":["Drug: Carbidopa-Levodopa","Drug: Methylphenidate","Drug: Amphetamine Sulfate","Drug: Placebo","Other: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Training"]},{"label":"Aim 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Healthy adult female and male subjects will receive repetitive TMS (rTMS) at different times or frequencies with respect to the training movement or sham stimulation.","interventionNames":["Other: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","Other: Sham Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)"]},{"label":"Aim 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Female and male subjects who have experienced a cerebral ischemic infarction, will receive study drugs and TMS to measure M1 excitability.","interventionNames":["Drug: Carbidopa-Levodopa","Drug: Methylphenidate","Drug: Amphetamine Sulfate","Drug: Placebo","Other: Sham Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","Other: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)","description":"Each TMS training session will begin with a baseline measurement lasting about 30 minutes in which brief magnetic pulses will be generated by the single-pulse and paired pulse TMS stimulator and the responses are recorded with surface EMG electrodes.
