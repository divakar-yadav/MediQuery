Different types of exercises are designed to target to cope up with the imbalance developed due to these neurological disorders. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of dual-task training using two different priority instructional sets in improving gait parameters such as self-selected velocity, fast speed, step length, and stride length in middle cerebral artery chronic stroke patients. A total of thirty middle cerebral artery chronic stroke patients were recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria and equally allocated into two groups. Group 1 received dual-task training with fixed priority instructional sets for four weeks and group 2 received dual-task training with variable priority instructional sets for four weeks. The outcome was assessed using a 10-meter walk test and the comparison of footprints on the walkway paper before and after training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke","Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Gait velocity","Stride length","Step length","Balance training","Dual task","Institutional priority sets"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dual-task Training Fixed Priority","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dual-task Training with fixed priority instructional set for four weeks.
