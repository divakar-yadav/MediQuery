Methods: 10 patients with stroke diagnosis and Fugl-Meyer score ranging from 34 to 55 will be selected to be included in the study. After signing the informed consent form and being assessed by the baseline evaluations, they will undertake 18 sessions of robotic therapy, which in its turn will be prescribed three times a week. After this period, the patients will be evaluated for future comparison of both the pre-treatment and final assessments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","upper limb","motor activity","robotic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After consent, 10 participants will be included in a training program, as described below: 1º session will be robotic calibration and assessment; the following 18 sessions will be conducted the robotic therapy for upper limbs, three times a week.
