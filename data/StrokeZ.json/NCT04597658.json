It was planned that the \"Informed Consent Form\" prepared before the study would be signed by the patient before being included in the study, and patient evaluation and follow-up forms would be filled in before and after the treatment.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria at the beginning of the study will be numbered according to the order of application and randomly divided into two groups with the computer program. Group number 1 Treadmill with Weight Support; Group number 2 will be determined as the Conventional Rehabilitation group. In addition to the traditional rehabilitation program and rehabilitation program to both groups, one group will be given body weight support and treadmill therapy. The treatment will be applied as 15 sessions 5 days a week.\n\nA traditional rehabilitation program will be applied to both groups. Posture and breathing exercises, lower extremity stretching, active auxiliary range of motion, and strengthening exercises will be applied. Electrical stimulation will not be delivered to the lower limb. Balance coordination exercises - sitting in a chair (individually shaped according to the patient's balance), holding it in a safe place if necessary; standing without support, standing quietly, heel tip, standing on one leg, and holding onto a chair). Patients will be asked to walk on a smooth surface in the company with a physiotherapist, using an assistive device, if any. The rehabilitation program is planned to last 30 minutes in total.\n\nIn the group where the bodyweight supported treadmill will be applied, patients will be asked to walk on the treadmill as fast as possible without exceeding the medium intensity according to the Borg scale. - Perceived fatigue on the Borg scale is quite mild 10-12. (40-50% of the maximum heart rate). Care should be taken that the patient wears appropriate shoes and clothing during walking.\n\nIn the beginning, 30% of the whole body weight will not be loaded. Bodyweight support will be reduced to 15% according to the tolerance of the patient. Later, when the patients can tolerate the speed of 2km / hour, they will not take more than two breaks during the 30-minute session, and 0% support will be applied when they are able to perform optimal walking without the need for at least 5 minutes of surveillance support. In the treatment to be performed under the guidance of a physiotherapist, manual intervention to the pelvis, trunk, and/or paretic extremity will correct the gait pattern. At the same time, verbal stimulation will ensure that temporal characteristics of the gait such as step length and walking speed are appropriate and at the same time the patient is motivated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Gait Disorders, Neurologic","Walking, Difficulty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Body weightsupported treadmill training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Bodyweight supported treadmill training (BWSTT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Bodyweight supported treadmill training (BWSTT)","description":"In the BWSTT group, walking training will be given by asking the patients to walk on the treadmill as fast as they can, without exceeding the medium intensity according to the Borg scale.

It consists of 49 questions (each question is scored on a five points scale, 1-5) covering 12 domains (mobility, upper limb functions, social role, energy, self-care, family role, work-productivity, language, mood, personality, thinking, and vision). Each domain score is calculated by taking the unweighted means of associated questions while the unweighted mean of all the domains is used to calculate the total score.","timeFrame":"Baseline (before intervention), immediately after intervention"},{"measure":"Change in Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment Score","description":"The Tinetti Assessment Tool is a simple, easily administered test that measures a resident's gait and balance. The test is scored on the resident's ability to perform specific tasks. Scoring of the Tinetti Assessment Tool is done on a three point ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2. A score of 0 represents the most impairment, while a score of 2 represents independence. The individual scores are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait assessment score, and overall balance assessment score, ad a combined gait and balance score. The maximum score for the gait component is 12 points. The maximum score for the balance component is 16 points. The maximum total score is 28 points. IN general, residents who score below 19 are at a high risk for falls. Residents who score in the range of 19 - 24 points indicate that the resident has a risk for falls.","timeFrame":"Baseline (before intervention), immediately after intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke\n* A history of the cerebrovascular event\n* Patients who can walk 10 meters with or without an assistive device and / or orthosis (Patients with lower extremity motor functions above 2 according to Brunnstrom staging)\n* Patients with comfortable walking speed \\<1.0 m / s\n* Patients who can follow verbal warnings (patients with Mini-mental test score \\> 19)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a stroke less than a month\n* Patients with stage 0 (non-functional ambulation) and stage 1 (the person's manual support is continuous) according to the functional ambulation scale\n* Presence of serious cardiovascular or respiratory system diseases that prevent exercising\n* Presence of uncontrolled metabolic disease (uncontrolled diabetes)\n* Participation in an intensive rehabilitation program in the last month and continuing\n* Presence of arthritis or severe contracture in the lower limb that may affect walking\n* Presence of other accompanying neuromuscular diseases (such as Parkinson's disease)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"95 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Elif Tarihçi, MD","affiliation":"Istanbul University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","city":"Istanbul","state":"Fatih","zip":"34093","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":41.01384,"lon":28.94966}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25467394","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Middleton A, Merlo-Rains A, Peters DM, Greene JV, Blanck EL, Moran R, Fritz SL.
