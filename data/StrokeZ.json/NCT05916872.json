The stroke patients aged between 30-70 years will be included in this study. Participants will be selected with non-probability convenience sampling technique. Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups by lottery method i.e experimental group and control group. The experimental group will receive proprioceptive neuromuscular technique (contract relax-10 repetition) (5-min) and electrical muscle stimulation(10 min) as 15 min session 3 times a week for four weeks while the control group will receive only conventional therapy. The outcome measure will be calculated by modified barthel index, modified ashworth scale and wolf motor function test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Proprioceptive Disorders","Balance; Distorted"],"keywords":["Stroke","Proprioceptive Disorders","Balance; Distorted"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"patients will be allocated to two groups by randomization.
