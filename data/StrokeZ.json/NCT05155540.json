In the first arm, 17 patients were recruited and underwent direct mechanical thrombectomy without receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. In the bridging therapy arm, 34 patients received first tissue plasminogen activator then underwent direct mechanical thrombectomy. The efficacy was evaluated by the NIHSS improvement 24 hours following stroke onset and the modified Rankin scale 3 months following stroke. Safety was assessed by the procedural complications rate especially the hemorhagic transformation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thrombectomy","Ischemic Stroke","Large-Artery Atherosclerosis
