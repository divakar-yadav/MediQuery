All consecutive patients with acute MRI- or CT-confirmed ischemic stroke admitting within 72 hours after symptom onset to the Department of Neurology Campus Benjamin Franklin of the university hospital of the Charité will be screened for cTnT elevations suggestive of myocardial infarction (\\>0,05 µg/l) on admission and day 2. Patients with increased troponin will undergo diagnostic coronary angiography within 72 hours. Diagnostic findings of coronary angiographies taken out in age- and gender-matched patients presenting with NSTE-ACS (Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome) to the Division of Cardiology will serve as a control. The primary endpoint of the study will be the occurrence of angiographic culprit lesions indicating focal cardiac damage on the basis of an acute CAD. Secondary endpoints will be the localisation of stroke in the cerebral imaging and ventriculographic findings of wall motion abnormalities suggestive of neurally mediated global cardiac dysfunction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","troponin elevation","transient apical ballooning","acute coronary syndrome","troponin elevation,","culprit lesion on coronary angiogram,","troponin elevation and stroke localisation (temporal lobe?)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Biomarkers indicating myocardial or neuronal damage"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":58,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke, troponin elevation","description":"Patients with stroke (proven by cerebral imaging) and troponin elevation undergoing coronary angiogram","interventionNames":["Procedure: coronary angiogram"]},{"label":"non-stemi (controll group)","description":"Patients with troponin elevation suggesting non-stemi undergoing coronary angiogram","interventionNames":["Procedure: coronary angiogram"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"coronary angiogram","description":"coronary angiogram","armGroupLabels":["non-stemi (controll group)","stroke, troponin elevation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"culprit lesion on coronary angiogram","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"transient apical ballooning on levocardiogram","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"stroke localization","timeFrame":"24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
