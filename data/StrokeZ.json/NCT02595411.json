The assessments will be video scored. At a later time point, different raters will rate the same video for inter-rater reliability, the same rater will score the same video for intra-rater reliability, and the same rater will score the repeated assessment videos for test-retest reliability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Palsy","Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury","Meningomyelocele","Central Nervous System Diseases"],"keywords":["Children","Rehabilitation","Upper Limb","Assessments","Outcome Measures"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Melbourne Assessment 2","description":"Assessment to measure unilateral upper limb function","timeFrame":"2 assessments within 1 week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* central motor disorders\n* ambulant or stationary patients of the Rehabilitation Center Affoltern am Albis\n* ability to understand test instructions\n* ability to sit upright for 25 minutes\n* minimal activity in the assessed upper limb\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe visual and/or auditory problems\n* acute lesion in the to assessed upper limb\n* lack of compliance","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Months","maximumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Children with central motor disorders and impaired upper limb function","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hubertus van Hedel, PD Dr.","affiliation":"University Children's Hospital Zurich, Rehabilitation Centre Affoltern am Albis","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Children's Hospital Zurich, Rehabilitation Centre Affoltern am Albis","city":"Affoltern am Albis","zip":"CH-8910","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.27743,"lon":8.45128}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001930","term":"Brain Injuries"},{"id":"D000002547","term":"Cerebral Palsy"},{"id":"D000070642","term":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000008591","term":"Meningomyelocele"},{"id":"D000016137","term":"Spina Bifida Cystica"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000006259","term":"Craniocerebral Trauma"},{"id":"D000020196","term":"Trauma, Nervous System"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"id":"D000001925","term":"Brain Damage, Chronic"},{"id":"D000009436","term":"Neural Tube Defects"},{"id":"D000009421","term":"Nervous System Malformations"},{"id":"D000000013","term":"Congenital Abnormalities"},{"id":"D000016135","term":"Spinal Dysraphism"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12847","name":"Paralysis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5486","name":"Cerebral Palsy","asFound":"Cerebral Palsy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4897","name":"Brain Injuries","asFound":"Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M628","name":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic","asFound":"Traumatic Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","asFound":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11264","name":"Meningomyelocele","asFound":"Meningomyelocele","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M18299","name":"Spina Bifida Cystica","asFound":"Meningomyelocele","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M18297","name":"Spinal Dysraphism","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9039","name":"Craniocerebral Trauma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21713","name":"Trauma, Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4892","name":"Brain Damage, Chronic","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12070","name":"Neural Tube Defects","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12","name":"Congenital Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12055","name":"Nervous System Malformations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T3999","name":"Myelomeningocele","asFound":"Meningomyelocele","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"T5337","name":"Spina Bifida","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
