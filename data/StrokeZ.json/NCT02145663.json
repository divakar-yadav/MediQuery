The study focuses on the ultra acute phase, \\<4.5 hours from symptom onset, including the prehospital setting. Analyses will include known biomarkers (e.g. GFAP, NR2 peptide) and a discovery phase for novel markers. Patient outcome will be evaluated at 3 month using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Human Serum and Plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1046,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for identifying ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracerebral hemorrhage and stroke mimics.","description":"Metrics: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value","timeFrame":"90 days +/- 5 days"},{"measure":"Predictive accuracy of biomarkers for identifying patients not responding to thrombolytic treatment.","description":"Metrics: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value","timeFrame":"90 days +/- 5 days"},{"measure":"Predictive accuracy of biomarkers for identifying patients facing hemorrhagic complications of thrombolytic treatment","description":"Metrics: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value","timeFrame":"90 days +/- 5 days"},{"measure":"Predictive accuracy of biomarkers for predicting outcome","description":"Metrics: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value","timeFrame":"90 days +/- 5 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute stroke suspected by EMS personnel\n* Transport to tertiary hospital as possible candidate for thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke\n* Age â‰¥18\n* Successful prehospital blood sampling by EMS personnel\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unsuccessful prehospital blood sampling by EMS personnel","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with suspected acute stroke, being transported by emergency medical services (EMS) to a tertiary hospital stroke center, as candidates for thrombolytic treatment of acute ischemic stroke.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Perttu Lindsberg, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Helsinki University Central Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Helsinki University Central Hospital","city":"Helsinki","state":"Uusimaa","zip":"00290","country":"Finland","geoPoint":{"lat":60.16952,"lon":24.93545}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"30758276","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Mattila OS, Puolakka T, Ritvonen J, Pihlasviita S, Harve H, Alanen A, Sibolt G, Curtze S, Strbian D, Pystynen M, Tatlisumak T, Kuisma M, Lindsberg PJ.
