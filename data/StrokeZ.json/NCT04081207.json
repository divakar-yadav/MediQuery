This study will increase our knowledge of how we can use assistive technology interventions to help people with aphasia restore language function. Further, this project will help us identify regions of the brain responsible for these changes.","detailedDescription":"In aphasia rehabilitation, usual care is focused on helping people recuperate as much of their pre-stroke language capacity as possible.Typically, usual care is a non-standardized therapy that is tailored to the specific needs of the person with aphasia.Once a person reaches a plateau in language recovery, AAC is implemented with a focus on circumventing, or compensating for the communication challenges associated with aphasia.\n\nThe ability of people with aphasia to (1) recover language function well-into the chronic phase of stroke recovery and (2) self-cue to promote word retrieval during anomic events offer the solution for how AAC could be employed as a dual-purpose tool to augment language recovery and compensate for deficits. This approach, however, this requires a shift in how AAC is implemented. With the goal of language recovery, treatment needs to focus on instructing people with aphasia how to use AAC as a mechanism for self-cueing, rather than as a tool to replace speaking. Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that this novel method to AAC implementation will promote language recovery by coupling the canonical language and visual processing neural networks.\n\nThis work will also contribute to our ability to identify, a priori, who will respond to this particular AAC intervention and who will not, by combining neuroimaging with behavioral and clinical data. This has the potential to reduce the cost of healthcare for stroke recovery by implementing the most effective treatment possible. Importantly, when we identify non-responders, this will allow us to construct a profile and identify features of the AAC treatment that require adjustment to meet their unique needs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Aphasia","Aphasia"],"keywords":["augmentative and alternative communication","aphasia","fMRI","DTI","neuroimaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Participant cohorts: We will use a 2 (groups) X 4 (measurement time points) switching replications design\\[18\\] to examine the effects of AAC on aphasia severity and spoken language (AIM 1), elucidate the neurobiological mechanism of AAC-induced language recovery (AIM 2), and identify AAC treatment responder subgroups (Exploratory Aim). This design will allow Group 2 to serve as the control group; however, they will still receive AAC treatment; thus, allowing us to increase the total N who receives AAC treatment to 20 people.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AAC-LaRc","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"all participants receive the experimental treatment","interventionNames":["Behavioral: AAC for Language Recovery (AAC-LaRc)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"AAC for Language Recovery (AAC-LaRc)","description":"iPads will be programmed with a personalized communication application (app) and a structured 4-step intervention will be employed to instruct patients how to cue themselves during anomic events via pictures, text, or speak buttons.","armGroupLabels":["AAC-LaRc"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Aphasia Quotient","description":"a diagnostic tool used to determine aphasia type and severity","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Visual Regions of Interest Activation intensity","description":"A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measure to indicate change in brain involvement during resting state and language tasks.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Connectivity Indices","description":"Connectivity indices reflect the temporal correlation between canonical language and visual regions of interest during language and resting state fMRI tasks.","timeFrame":"3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor-Free Visual Perception Test-4","description":"The Motor-Free Visual Perception Test-4 assesses visual perceptual ability without requiring motor responses.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Discourse Analyses","description":"We will calculate percentage of counted words, mazes, correct information units, t-units, during personal story retells with and without the AAC support.","timeFrame":"3years"},{"measure":"Communication analyses","description":"We will calculate percentage of communication conveyed via pictures, text boxes, and speak button during personal story retells with and without the iPad AAC support.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life-39 (SAQOL-39)","description":"The SAQOL-39 is a valid and reliable measure of health related quality of life, post-stroke that uses an aphasia friendly 5 point Likert scale format.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Communication Effectiveness Index (CETI)","description":"The CETI measures functional communication scenarios that caregivers rate the ability of the patient to complete tasks, as compared to before their stroke, via a 10 cm visual analogue scale.","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Fractional Anisotropy (FA)","description":"FA is a value of diffusion and reflects white matter density and myelination.
