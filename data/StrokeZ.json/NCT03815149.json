The medical records from 500 procedures completed at Gold Coast University Hospital in Queensland (QLD), Prince of Wales Hospital in New South Wales (NSW), and Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital in Western Australia (WA), will be analysed.\n\nThe study will report the risk and likelihood of stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic), delayed neurological adverse events and incomplete aneurysm occlusion within sub-groups of the patient cohort and determine the predictive or confounding factors that influence clinical outcomes under pragmatic or 'real-world' conditions.","detailedDescription":"Methodology summary: Single-arm, longitudinal, retrospective, multi-centre cohort study. A collaboration of Australian Interventional Neuroradiologists will create a data bank of existing clinical and angiographic data extracted from medical records review. The data collection variables are pre-specified using grading scales and clinical assessment with the greatest reliability or significant to to accurately represent patient cohorts receiving treatment within all indications of use. The study will establish a minimum dataset to collect patient socio-demographics, aneurysm characteristics, device characteristics, and clinical outcomes for up to 500 procedures completed using Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology™. A framework for data ab The prevalence, severity and outcomes of neurological adverse events of interest and bleeding events will be reported . Independent physician assessments of complete aneurysm occlusion from completed computed tomography scans (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans and Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) procedures will be determined according to the Raymond Roy Occlusion Classification (MRRC), O'Kelly Marotta scale (OKM) for aneurysm occlusion using flow diverting devices and the Consensus grading scale for endovascular aneurysm occlusion up to 12 months post procedure. Assessments of wall apposition and in-stent stenosis (ISS) will also be completed.\n\nQuality Assurance plan includes - Framework data abstraction - manual of procedures, data dictionary, data abstraction manual, desired inter-rater reliability +0.80; intrarater reliability, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.75 - 0.9;\n\nMedical imaging review assessed by assess aneurysm occlusion by an independent interventional neuroradiologist or a local physician operator that did not complete the primary procedure.
