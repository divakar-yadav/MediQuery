The purpose of this study is to collect information about the ability of the EmboTrap device to remove blood clots from the brain, and the associated performance characteristics and clinical outcomes.

Instead, estimates of each population parameter of interest for all primary and secondary endpoints will be provided using appropriate confidence intervals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Brain","Brain Clot","Brain Diseases","Brain Infarction","Cerebral Ischemia","Cerebrovascular Disorders","EmboTrap® Revascularization Device","EmboTrap","Ischemia","Ischemic","Ischemic Stroke","Mechanical Thrombectomy","Neurovascular Intervention","Revascularization","Stent Retriever","Stroke","Vascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EmboTrap® Revascularization Device","description":"The EmboTrap® Revascularization Device is the investigational device","interventionNames":["Device: EmboTrap® Revascularization Device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"EmboTrap® Revascularization Device","armGroupLabels":["EmboTrap® Revascularization Device"],"otherNames":["EmboTrap"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of Revascularisation Following the Use of the Neuravi Device.","description":"Revascularisation is defined as achieving a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction (mTICI) score of 2b or greater.\n\nmTICI is a 6-point grading system for determining the response of thrombolytic therapy for ischaemic stroke:\n\nmTICI 0 = No perfusion\n\nmTICI 1 = Penetration but not perfusion\n\nmTICI 2a = Some perfusion with distal branch filling of \\<50% of territory visualized\n\nmTICI 2b = Substantial perfusion with distal branch filling of ≥50% of territory visualized\n\nmTICI 2c = Near-complete perfusion\n\nmTICI 3 = Complete perfusion","timeFrame":"Day 1"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to Revascularization","description":"Defined as time from groin puncture to visualization of final angiographic result.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Mortality Post Procedure","description":"All procedure related mortality (i.e. directly traceable to a procedure related SAE).","timeFrame":"7 and 90(±14) days post procedure"},{"measure":"Serious Adverse Device Related Effects (SADE)","description":"SADE is defined as vessel perforation or vessel dissection, which is attributable to the Neuravi device, or where the Neuravi device cannot be ruled out as the cause.","timeFrame":"24(-8/+12) hours Post Procedure"},{"measure":"Symptomatic ICH","description":"Symptomatic ICH rate within 24 hours (range: 16 to 36 hours) post-procedure.
