real-life conditions in France:\n\nWhat are the patient and disease characteristics, comorbidities and treatment history in NVAF patients initiating a new Anticoagulant (AC) treatment, according to treatment currently available and prescribed (apixaban, other NOACs, VKAs), and are the AC-naive patient profiles different from one treatment pattern to another when initiating a new AC treatment?\n\nWhat are the HCP's reasons for discontinuing the previous AC strategy for initiating and choosing the newly initiated AC treatment in NVAF patients?\n\nWhat are the conditions of newly-initiated apixaban prescriptions in NVAF patients: prescriber, proportion of naïve/experienced patients, daily dosage and number of daily
