We also used a semi-structured questionnaire to qualitatively interview stroke survivors. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy scales, Resilience Scale, McMaster Family Assessment Device, and Quality of Life Scale were used to test the intervention effects. Further, complex scientific concepts will be used to analyze the transition experience of stroke survivors.\n\nExpected outcomes: The Family System Care and Theme Care Action Module can improve family function, resilience, self-efficacy, and quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patient","Caregiver"],"keywords":["Resilience","Family system nursing","Self-efficacy","Quality of life","Complexity science","Transition theory","Caregiver","Stroke."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"To integrate Family System Care and Theme Care Action Module to improve resilience, family function, self-efficacy, and quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers.\n\nFirst, understand the care needs of patients and caregivers, and apply The Specific Thematic Nursing Care Action Modules (STNC-AM) platform for education and training.\n\nThe Specific Thematic Nursing Care Action Modules (STNC-AM) platform that we present here is an educational program that integrates education and coaching.
