To date, no clear evidence showed a specific effect of any therapy in the acute phase of aphasia after stroke. This study aims to compare the effect of a combined therapy (linguistic/communication) versus a linguistic therapy on communication performance in patients in the acute phase of aphasia after a first stroke.","detailedDescription":"Twenty to 25% of strokes cause aphasia. Speech and language therapy is the well-known standard treatment of aphasia after stroke although it is based on weak scientific evidence. To date, the efficacy criteria of aphasia rehabilitation are early stage, intensity as well as personalized treatment. Usually these patients receive in acute phase a linguistic training focused on the linguistic impairment. This approach is based on the cerebral plasticity postulate. However the superiority of this practice compared to other methods has never been shown. Moreover the benefit of the combination gathering linguistic treatment with communication treatment has to our knowledge never been studied.\n\nIn the present study investigators propose to compare the effect of a combined linguistic/communication rehabilitation versus a linguistic treatment. To do so, investigators will recruit patients with aphasia after a first stroke, in the acute phase. After a allocation to the \" combined \" and \" linguistic \" groups, all the patients will have a comprehensive language and neuropsychological assessment before and after 3 months of rehabilitation, and finally 6 months after the onset.\n\nThe \"linguistic\" group will have a rehabilitation only focused on linguistic processes whereas the \"combined\" group will have a linguistic training as well as communication training. The therapy will be personalized and the therapists will exclusively use standardized linguistic and/or communication toolboxes of rehabilitation containing dedicated activities."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia, Acquired"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Rehabilitation","Communication","Linguistics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"There are two arms in the protocol: one experimental arm corresponding to the \"combined\" rehabilitation (linguistic/communication) compared with another arm corresponding to the \"linguistic\" rehabilitation.\n\nAll included patients, after allocation based on aphasia severity to the \" combined \" and \" linguistic \" groups, will have a first evaluation (E1: language, neurologic and neuropsychological exams) within 7 days after the onset.
