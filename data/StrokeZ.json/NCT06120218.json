However, one of the common complications after emergent carotid stenting is hemorrhagic transformation that makes the effect of this method controversial. The investigators investigated whether emergent carotid stenting achieved the improvement of clinical outcome in acute large vessel occlusion stroke.","detailedDescription":"Tandem occlusions estimated from 10% to 30% in acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke. These acute lesions had a worse prognosis with mortality rate about 50%, if the aggresive medical treatment, even intravenous thrombolysis alone was the first choice. The HERMES meta-analysis involving in mechanical thrombectomy from individual data of 5 randomized controlled trials showed benefit of mechanical thrombectomy of 122 tandem occlusions compared with medical management alone, but the endovascular treatment methods are debatable between angioplasty versus stenting at proximal extracranial carotid occlusion after successful recanalization in the intracranial segments. Multiple studies recorded recently the emergent carotid stenting was the additional option to improve cerebral blood flow which associated to favorable outcomes after acute tandem occlusions. However, there was a lack of evidence for the benefit of emergent carotid stenting in tandem occlusions in Asia. Therefore, the investigators aimed in this study to access the favorable outcomes in case of tandem occlusions treated with this procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke, Acute","Carotid Stenosis"],"keywords":["internal carotid artery","acute ischemic stroke","stenting","tandem occlusions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Emergent Carotid Stenting (ECS)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Emergent Carotid Stenting in acute ischemic stroke caused by tandem occlusions","interventionNames":["Procedure: Emergent Carotid Stenting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Emergent Carotid Stenting","description":"Emergent Carotid Stenting in acute ischemic stroke caused by tandem occlusions","armGroupLabels":["Emergent Carotid Stenting (ECS)"],"otherNames":["ECS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The favorable 3-month outcome rate","description":"The favorable 3-month outcome rate was accessed by modified Rankin Score (mRS), which comprised of included good (mRS 0 - ≤ 2) and fair (mRS 3).","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate","description":"The symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as patient's intracerebral hemorrhage with postprocedural mRS ≥ 5 and there were no other evident causes for the increased mRS.","timeFrame":"24 hours after emergent carotid stenting"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years old\n* Onset to treatment time \\< 24 hours\n* NIHSS ≥ 6\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Premorbid mRS \\> 2\n* Loss to follow up after discharge","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Cuong Tran Chi, Doctor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+84886559911","email":"drcuongtran@dotquy.vn"},{"name":"Can Tho Stroke International Services Hospital","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+84886559911","email":"cskh@dotquy.vn"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Cuong Tran Chi, Doctor","affiliation":"Can Tho Stroke International Services General Hospital","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Can Tho Stroke International Services Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Can Tho","zip":"900000","country":"Vietnam","contacts":[{"name":"Cuong Tran Chi, Doctor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+84886559911","email":"drcuongtran@dotquy.vn"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":10.03711,"lon":105.78825}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36542074","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Allard J, Delvoye F, Pop R, Labreuche J, Maier B, Marnat G, Sibon I, Zhu F, Lapergue B, Consoli A, Spelle L, Denier C, Richard S, Piotin M, Gory B, Mazighi M; ETIS Investigators. 24-Hour Carotid Stent Patency and Outcomes After Endovascular Therapy: A Multicenter Study.
