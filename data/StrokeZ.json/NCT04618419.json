Internal jugular vein distensibility index (IJVDI) has been studied in several studies but its reliability has not been well confirmed in patients during cardiac surgery.\n\nThis is a prospective observational study of adults undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery . The primary aim of the study is to assess the reliability of predicting fluid responsiveness in adults undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery using sonogram of the internal jugular vein for assessment of vessel distensibility in relation to stroke volume variation (SVV) measaured by electrical cardiometry.The secondary aim is to evaluate the ability of thoracic fluid content (TFC) measured by electrical cardiometry to be an additive value for the assessment of fluid responsiveness.\n\nVolume responsiveness will be independently assessed by IJV sonogram and electrical cardiometry in following times\n\n1. After induction of anesthesia.\n2. After transfusing 6 ml / kg of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% before sternotomy.\n3. After closure of the sternum and transfusion of patient's blood.\n4. Immediately before transferring the patient to ICU and stabilization of hemodynamic parameters by giving fluids needed to patient.\n5. Immediately after transferring the patient to ICU and stabilization of hemodynamic parameters by giving fluids needed to patient.\n6. After 2 hour of ICU admission.\n7. Before weaning from mechanical ventilation Fluid responsiveness will be assessed by examining SVV with a threshold of the SVV = 12% allow discrimination between Responders and Non-responders"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ultrasound of IJV","Electrical Cardiometry"],"keywords":["CABG surgery","Internal jugular vein","stroke volume variation","TFC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"internal jugular vein distensibility index","description":"It is a prospective observational clinical study to correlate hemodynamic monitoring between Electrical Cardiometry and internal jugular vein distensibility index by sonogram"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"fluid responsiveness after fluid challenge","description":"Correlation between SVV and IJVDI","timeFrame":"24 hours from the start of surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAdults (\\>18 years old) Able to provide advanced informed consent Planned for elective CABG surgery\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\< 18 years\n* Severely reduced preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 40 %\n* Significant cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Significant valvular heart disease.\n* Clinically evident pulmonary disease.\n* Bilaterally inserted venous catheters (jugular or subclavian vein)\n* History of radiotherapy or surgery of the neck region.\n* Inability to obtain interpretable ultrasound images due to a difficult acoustic window.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Demographic data, hemodynamic parameters as heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP),CVP and urine output have been registered.\n\nCardiac data derived from electrical cardiometry including: CO ,cardiac index( CI), stroke volume variation( SVV) and thoracic fluid content were also recorded.\n\nIJVDI by sonogram was assessed","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Alexandria university","city":"Alexandria","country":"Egypt","geoPoint":{"lat":31.21564,"lon":29.95527}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29075482","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Aronson S, Nisbet P, Bunke M.
