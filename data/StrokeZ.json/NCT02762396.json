Standardized questionnaires will be used to collect information about education and work before stroke and the situation after 3 months and one year. The frequency and reasons why patients did not come back to their education situation or their job they did before the stroke are collected. We expect that it is still possible within a year from stroke onset, to specify the sort of problem related to stroke or unrelated to stroke. This may get more unspecific, the longer the time gets from stroke onset to follow-up.
