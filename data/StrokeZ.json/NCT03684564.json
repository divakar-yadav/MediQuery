Warfarin tends to have a variable 'blood thinning' effect in patients with APS, necessitating frequent (usually weekly) INR blood tests to monitor the effect of the warfarin, which is inconvenient for patients.\n\nThe RISAPS trial will compare higher intensity (higher dose) rivaroxaban versus higher intensity warfarin (current standard of care treatment) for 24 months, in APS patients, with or without lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus; SLE), requiring higher intensity anticoagulation after experiencing a stroke, a 'mini stroke' (also known as a transient ischaemic attack) or other ischaemic brain damage (caused by blood clots in the brain arteries or smaller blood vessels). When compared with warfarin, a dvantages of rivaroxaban include, fixed dose prescribing and no need for monitoring of anticoagulant effect.\n\nFurthermore, rivaroxaban has fewer drug-food interactions, and significantly fewer drug-drug interactions than warfarin. If rivaroxaban is no worse than warfarin for anticoagulation of APS patients with stroke or other ischaemic brain manifestations, it could become the standard of care for the treatment of APS patients, with or without lupus, who have experienced stroke or other ischaemic brain manifestations and improve patients' quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Antiphospholipid Syndrome","Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Brain Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants enrolled in RISAPS will be randomly allocated 1:1 to receive either oral rivaroxaban 15mg twice daily or oral warfarin (standard of care in the RISAPS trial) to maintain a target INR of 3.5 (range 3.0-4.0) for 24 months.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rivaroxaban (Treatment Arm)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Rivaroxaban"]},{"label":"Warfarin (Control Arm)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rivaroxaban","description":"Oral tablet 15 mg twice daily for 24 months","armGroupLabels":["Rivaroxaban (Treatment Arm)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin","description":"Oral anticoagulant given as standard of care in the RISAPS trial to maintain a target INR of 3.5 (range 3.0-4.0) for 24 months","armGroupLabels":["Warfarin (Control Arm)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To compare the efficacy of high-intensity oral rivaroxaban (15mg twice daily) vs high-intensity warfarin, target INR 3.5 (range 3.0-4.0), in patients with APS with or without SLE who have had a stroke or other ischaemic brain manifestations.","description":"The comparison of efficacy will be based on the rate of change in brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on MRI, a surrogate marker of ischaemic damage, between baseline and 24 months follow up.","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"A) Efficacy - Neuroradiological markers","description":"i) Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy as a measure of microstructural white matter damage derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ii) Changes in total brain volume, white matter volume and grey matter volume on T1 weighted volumetric images iii) Brain infarcts\n\n1. cortical or subcortical\n2. assessment of volume iv) Cerebral venous occlusions","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Clinical","description":"(i) Vascular events\n\n1.
