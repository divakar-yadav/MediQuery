Combined brain and nerve stimulation can strengthen the neural pathways that control hand function. In this study, we will deliver combined brain and nerve stimulation during specific time windows that increase activation of neural pathways underlying hand function.

This synchronous arrival is postulated to cause long-term potentiation via spike timing-dependent plasticity, which then improves corticospinal transmission and hand function. In this study, paired corticomotoneuronal stimulation (PCMS) will be applied during specific brain states that reflect increased recruitment of motoneurons via the corticospinal tract. This increased recruitment is expected to enhance the beneficial effects of PCMS on human hand function after stroke.","armGroupLabels":["PCMS during brain states reflecting strong corticospinal transmission","PCMS during random brain states"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximum hand force output","description":"This will be measured using maximum voluntary contractions of the stroke-affected first dorsal interosseous hand muscle during pinching actions.","timeFrame":"up to 1 hour after intervention"},{"measure":"Maximum hand muscle activation","description":"This will be measured using electromyography recordings of the stroke-affected first dorsal interosseous muscle during maximum voluntary contractions during pinching actions","timeFrame":"up to 1 hour after intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Amplitude of motor evoked potentials","description":"This will be measured as the peak-to-peak amplitude of motor-evoked potentials recorded from the stroke-affected first dorsal interosseous muscle","timeFrame":"up to 1 hour after intervention"},{"measure":"Time to complete the 9-hole peg test","description":"This will be measured as the time needed to complete the task using the stroke-affected hand.","timeFrame":"up to 1 hour after intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of stroke \\> 6 months ago\n* Presence of residual upper extremity hemiparesis\n* Willingness to participate\n* Ability to provide informed consent\n* Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score \\< 66\n* Mini Mental State Exam score \\> 24\n* Discernible and reliable motor-evoked potential (MEP) elicited following single-pulse TMS to the lesioned hemisphere\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of neurological disease other than stroke\n* Presence of contraindications to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), including: history of adverse reactions to TMS or PNS metal in head, eyes, neck, chest/trunk, or arms, including but not limited to shrapnel, surgical clips, fragments from metalworking, fragments from welding, implanted device, history of frequent and severe headaches or migraines, immediate family history of seizure or epilepsy, personal history of seizure or epilepsy, current, suspected, or planned pregnancy, current or recent (within the last 3 months) use of medications acting on the central nervous system other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including but not limited to antipsychotic drugs, benzodiazepines, prescription stimulants.\n* Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score â‰¥ 66 (66 is the maximum on this scale)\n* Mini Mental State Exam score \\<= 24\n* No discernible and reliable MEP elicited following single-pulse TMS to the lesioned hemisphere","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of Texas at Austin","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Austin","state":"Texas","zip":"78712","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Sara Hussain","role":"CONTACT","phone":"512-232-2686","email":"sara.hussain@austin.utexas.edu"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":30.26715,"lon":-97.74306}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"Individual participant data may be shared using an open-access data repository.
