In the active rTMS group, 10 sessions of intact hemispheric upper extremity motor area (M1) were targeted and inhibitor rTMS was applied with a frequency of 1 Hz consisting of 1200 pulses for 20 minutes. In the active cTBS group, 10 sessions of intact hemispheric upper extremity motor area (M1) were targeted and cTBS was administered for a total of 600 pulses consisting of 3 burst stimulations of 50 Hz repeated every 200 milliseconds for 40 seconds. Sham cTBS was applied in the same protocol but using sham coil. Within 30 minutes after TMS sessions, all patients underwent 10 sessions of joint range of motion, stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination exercises, hand rehabilitation and daily living activities under the guidance of a physiotherapist, regardless of which group they were in. Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Activity Log-28 (MAL-28) and Brunnstrom upper extremity and hand motor recovery stage were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow up at 4 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation","Functional Recovery","Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active rTMS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"chronic ischemic stroke patients receiving active low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy and physical therapy","interventionNames":["Device: Active Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy"]},{"label":"Active cTBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"chronic ischemic stroke patients receiving active continuous theta burst stimulation therapy and physical therapy","interventionNames":["Device: Active Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation Therapy"]},{"label":"Sham cTBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"chronic ischemic stroke patients receiving sham continuous theta burst stimulation therapy and physical therapy","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Active Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy","description":"10 sessions of intact hemispheric upper extremity motor area (M1) were targeted and inhibitor rTMS was applied with a frequency of 1 Hz consisting of 1200 pulses for 20 minutes.
