About 1/3 patients can obtain good prognosis through intravenous thrombolysis. Good prognosis can be gotten from about 50 percent of patients with big artery disease by mechanical embolization. However, only a small proportion of the population can be treated with restoration perfusion in the time window. The main purpose of antiplatelet therapy is to prevent the recurrence and progression of stroke, and stroke unit is a kind of management mode. How to improve the neurological function of patients has been a hot and difficult problem in clinical practice.\n\nA large number of basic and clinical studies have proved that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has protective effect on ischemic stroke. Hahn et al showed that RIC could play a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in MCAO model. Other studies have also confirmed that preconditioning RIC has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia in animal models. One open label study by Hougaard et al shows that RIC can improve the NIHSS score in acute ischemic stroke patients. One recent study found that 300 consecutive days RIC therapy for the patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis significantly reduced the recurrence rate of stroke, improved the mRS score and recovered the blood flow in the lesion site. Furthermore, several studies have also shown that RIC can not only improve the neurological function of patients with cerebral infarction after intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombolysis, but also protect the secondary brain injury after carotid stenting. These results suggest that RIC has a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke and deserves further study.\n\nBased on the above discussion, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of RIC in the treatment of acute moderate ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1800,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Guideline-based therapy+RIC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RIC is given twice a day with 200mmHg pressure.","interventionNames":["Device: Remote Ischemic Conditioning treatment"]},{"label":"Guideline-based therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Guideline-based therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Remote Ischemic Conditioning treatment","description":"Remote Ischemic Conditioning is given twice a day with 200mmHg pressure.","armGroupLabels":["Guideline-based therapy+RIC"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Guideline-based therapy","description":"Guideline-based therapy","armGroupLabels":["Guideline-based therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-1）","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of mRS (0-2）","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of early neurological deterioration","description":"more than 4 NIHSS score increase compared with baseline","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of stroke associated pneumonia","timeFrame":"12±2 days"},{"measure":"occurrence of stroke or other vascular events","timeFrame":"90±7 days"},{"measure":"proportion of death of any cause","timeFrame":"90±7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
