However, in most of the thrombolyzing hospitals worldwide MR imaging is not available. We hypothesize that pragmatic non-contrast CT (NCCT)-based WUS/SUO thrombolysis may be feasible and safe.\n\nMethods: TRUST-CT is an international multicenter registry-based study. WUS/SUO patients undergoing NCCT-based thrombolysis with NIHSS ≥ 4 and initial ASPECTS ≥ 7 are included and compared to propensity score matched non-thrombolyzed WUS/SUO controls. Primary endpoint is symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); secondary endpoints include 24-hour NIHSS change of ≥ 4 and modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":117,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"sICH","description":"symptomatic ICH according to ECASS3","timeFrame":"72hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS 90 days","description":"mRS 90 days","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion:\n\n1.
