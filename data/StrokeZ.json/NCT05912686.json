The investigators will undertake a multi-center, prospective, parallel-controlled, open-label, superiority randomized controlled study based on past research on intense lipid-lowering intervention trials. Patients undergoing post-thrombectomy will be divided into two groups: the test group and the control group. After surgery, the test group will be given a high dose of atorvastatin (80mg/day), followed by a standard dose (20mg/day). The control group will continue to receive the standard dose of atorvastatin (20mg/day). The investigators will compare the high-resolution vascular wall MRI characteristics (vascular wall enhancement, lumen stenosis rate, and so on) within 3-5 days of the operation, as well as the composite incidence of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracranial hemorrhage 1 month postoperatively, and the modified Rankin Score at 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mechanical Thrombectomy","Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Single (Outcomes Assessor)"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":162,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"high-dose arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The test group will undergo high-dose atorvastatin treatment (80mg/day) for the first 3 days after the mechanical embolectomy, transitioning to a standard dose (20mg/day) of atorvastatin thereafter.","interventionNames":["Drug: Atorvastatin 80mg"]},{"label":"standard-dose arm","type":"OTHER","description":"a standard dose (20mg/day) of atorvastatin after the mechanical embolectomy","interventionNames":["Drug: Atorvastatin 20mg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atorvastatin 80mg","description":"The test group will undergo high-dose atorvastatin treatment (80mg/day) for the first 3 days after the procedure, transitioning to a standard dose (20mg/day) of atorvastatin thereafter.","armGroupLabels":["high-dose arm"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atorvastatin 20mg","description":"The control group will receive a consistent standard dose (20mg/day) of atorvastatin.","armGroupLabels":["standard-dose arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebral vascular wall damage","description":"Incidence of T1 hyperintensity and T1 shortening within the arterial wall in HR-VWI","timeFrame":"within 5-7 days after MT"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Target vessel stenosis rate","description":"The stenosis rate of target blood vessel artery 5-7 days after MT surgery.","timeFrame":"Within 5-7 days after MT"},{"measure":"Perioperative complications","description":"Cumulative incidence rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, TIA or ischemic stroke within 30 days after MT surgery.","timeFrame":"Within 30 days after MT"},{"measure":"Neurological function evaluation","description":"Proportion of patients with good prognosis 3 months after MT surgery.","timeFrame":"Within 90 days after MT"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
