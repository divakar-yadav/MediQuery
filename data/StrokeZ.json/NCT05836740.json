In addition, we will explore the effect of Minocycline versus placebo on indicators of venous neuroinflammation and thrombo-inflammation at different time points in patients with moderate to severe acute ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate the effect of Minocycline in improving the level of mRS score to 0-1 in patients with moderate to severe acute ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset.\n\nThe trial was divided into three phases: screening/baseline period, treatment period, and follow-up period.
