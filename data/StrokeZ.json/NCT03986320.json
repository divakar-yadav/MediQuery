Gait is one of the most important activities of daily living affected in this patient population. Recent technological developments in passively powered dermoskeleton can create powerful adjunctive tools for rehabilitation and potentially accelerate functional recovery. Here, the investigators present the development and evaluation of a lower limb dermoskeleton, namely Keeogo™ (B-Temia), for use in rehabilitation institutions to assist individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke who are able to stand and initiate a step in performing ambulatory functions.\n\nKeeogo™ Dermoskeleton is a low-profile, assistive exoskeleton (or 'dermoskeleton') that orthotically fits to the lower limbs. Keeogo™ is worn on the user's lower body using a belt and contact areas attached around the thighs and calves."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Stroke","Hemiparesis","Cerebral Vascular Accident"],"keywords":["Keeogo™","Dermoskeleton","Powered dermoskeleton","Lower limb dermoskeleton","Assistive exoskeleton","Orthotic dermoskeleton"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Device: Keeogo™ Dermoskeleton This device is intended for use in rehabilitation institutions to assist individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke who are able to stand and initiate a step in performing ambulatory functions.","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Sites will enroll participants in order of recruitment.
