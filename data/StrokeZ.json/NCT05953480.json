In addition, hospitalization during the Follow-up Period is not anticipated, and the participant appears likely to be able to complete the study. Medically stable is defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy for 3 months following enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any disease or neurological disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the study\n* A severe decrease in consciousness level (defined as NIHSS item 1a score 3: Not alert, responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects, or totally unresponsive, flaccid, and areflexic)\n* Disability corresponding to a mRS score of ≥ 2 before the onset of stroke\n* A history of stroke (excluding transient ischemic attack), history of or current intracranial hemorrhage, or head trauma that caused neurological effects within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent\n* Participants with an ischemic stroke in cerebellum and/or brain stem as the main infarction site\n* Diagnosis of a current transient ischemic attack\n* Unable to undergo either CT or MRI\n* Considered by the investigator to be inappropriate to participate due to a history or complication of serious cardiovascular disease within 1 month of screening (for example, history of acute myocardial infarction, current acute myocardial infarction, uncontrollable heart failure, infective endocarditis requiring treatment, or acute aortic dissection, or requiring or likely to require hospitalization for severe arrhythmia during the study)\n* Blood glucose level \\< 50 or \\> 400 milligrams/deciliter after glycemic control\n* Systolic blood pressure ≥ 220 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mmHg after antihypertensive treatment\n* Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or clinically significant drug or other severe allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in the study\n* Use of prohibited concomitant medications or therapies listed in the protocol for the treatment of current AIS\n* Participants who have previously received redasemtide\n*
