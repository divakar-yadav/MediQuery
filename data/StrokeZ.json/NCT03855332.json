However, there is limited evidence for how small vessel disease develops and no specific treatment. One potential explanation is that greater pulsations in blood pressure are transmitted to the brain through stiff blood vessels, resulting in increased pressure hitting the brain each time the heart beats and reduced blood flow between heart beats.\n\nSildenafil is used to open up blood vessels (a vasodilator) in patients with erectile difficulties or poor blood supply to the lungs. This trial will test sildenafil (50mg, thrice daily) against placebo and a similar drug (cilostazol 100mg, twice daily) in 75 patients with previous stroke or mini-stroke and small vessel disease, given in random order to every participant for 3 weeks each. It will primarily assess changes in pulsations of blood flow to the brain on each tablet, measured with an ultrasound scanner (transcranial ultrasound). To understand why any changes occur, we will also measure the stiffness of arteries, the blood pressure at the heart and how much blood vessels in the brain open up when participants breathe air with added carbon dioxide (6%), using ultrasound in all participants and on MRI brain scans in 30 patients.\n\nThis study will test whether a vasodilator used in other conditions with a good safety profile can reduce pulsations in blood flow to the brain, to assess whether it is a good candidate drug to reduce the progression of small vessel disease in future clinical trials. This would be the first effective treatment for a condition associated with a very high burden of disability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Small Vessel Cerebrovascular Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, crossover design","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"All participants will undergo three phases in random order:\n\nThe placebo phase will include overencapsulated placebo, matched to overencapsulated active agents, 2 tablets 3 times daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Sildenafil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"25mg three times daily, overencapsulated tablet, increased after 1 week to 50mg three times daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Sildenafil"]},{"label":"Cilostazol","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"50mg bd, overencapsulated tablet (with midday placebo), increased after 1 week to 100mg bd (with midday placebo)","interventionNames":["Drug: Cilostazol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Sildenafil","description":"See above","armGroupLabels":["Sildenafil"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cilostazol","description":"See above","armGroupLabels":["Cilostazol"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Overencapsulated placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Middle cerebral arterial pulsatility index","description":"Difference in Gosling's pulsatility index after three weeks treatment with sildenafil versus placebo, in 75 patients","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage increase in MCA velocity on 6% CO2 vs medical air","description":"1.
