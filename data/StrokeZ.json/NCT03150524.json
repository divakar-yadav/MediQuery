Neuroimaging (CT, Magnetic Resonance (MR), or 4 vessel angiogram) will be obtained along with a baseline transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD). They will subsequently be randomized to receive nimodipine (every 4 hours) or extended release verapamil (twice daily). Mean cerebral blood flow velocities will be followed for reduction or normalization on daily TCD and medication dosing adjusted appropriately. Patients will be followed 90 days post-discharge at which time they will undergo repeat neuroimaging to confirm resolution of vascular abnormalities and repeat evaluation. To determine effectiveness, the investigators will evaluate both short-term (surrogate) in-hospital outcomes and long-term outcomes. Reduction of TCD velocities and headache severity will serve as our short-term surrogate outcomes; however, need for additional medications, blood pressure, new/recurrent stroke/Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) will also be evaluated along with modified Rankin score (mRS) on discharge, length of stay, and discharge disposition. At 90 days, the investigators will also assess headache control along with mRS.. Adverse events and their relation to the treatment arms will be assessed, and adherence to the medications will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction
