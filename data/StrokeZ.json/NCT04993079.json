A secondary purpose is to assess the clinical performance, defined as the feasibility of measuring clot electrophysiological parameters in vivo during EVT procedures.","detailedDescription":"Clotild® is a neurovascular guidewire equipped with the Sensome proprietary impedance sensor. The latter allows the measurement of the electrophysiological characteristics of the surrounding tissues. Clotild® could categorize the thrombus occluding the cerebral blood vessel, and support the neurointerventionist during mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and the performance of the device. The electrophysiological measurements will be used to update Clotild®'s database and thus improve the prediction accuracy of the model in providing physicians with insights for mechanical thrombectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Clotild®","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects presenting an acute ischemic stroke due to M1 or middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation occlusion, eligible for Endovascular Thrombectomy (EVT) based on neuro-interventionist and/or neurologist investigators' opinion will be eligible.
