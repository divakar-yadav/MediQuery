The aim of this study was to assess for the first time whether TEE has a negative influence on swallowing in acute stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Dysphagia is common in patients with acute stroke and deteriorates the overall outcome (1). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a routine examination in the diagnostic workup of stroke etiology. In cardiac surgery it is known as cause of postoperative dysphagia (2).\n\nUsing flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) T.E.D.R.A.S., as a prospective, blinded, randomized and controlled study, includes patients in two groups in order to test the influence of TEE on swallowing in acute stroke: an intervention group and a control group. FEES is performed for analysis of swallowing in the intervention group (1) one day before TEE, (2) 2-4 hours after TEE, (3) 24 hours after TEE. In the control group FEES is performed on three consecutive days with TEE taking place any time after the last FEES. Validated scores assess dysphagia severity in both groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Dysphagia","Swallowing Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TEE FEES","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)","Diagnostic Test: Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"FEES","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)","Diagnostic Test: Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)","description":"Ultrasound of heart chambers via esophagus","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Intervention group"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing","description":"Endoscopical swallowing study","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Secretion severity","description":"Change in presence and severity of dysphagia examined via FEES and scored by Murray´s Secretions Severity Rating Scale Minimum value: 0 Maximum value: 3 Higher scores mean worse outcome","timeFrame":"Intervention group: One day before TEE;
