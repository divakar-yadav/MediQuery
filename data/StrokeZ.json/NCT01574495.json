One promising form of robotic training that leverages the power of neuro-plasticity is error augmentation. In this paradigm the computer singles out and magnifies a stroke survivor's movement errors from a desired trajectory, thus forcing the subjects to strengthen their control. Using the VRROOM, a state-of-the-art system which uses haptics (robotic forces) and graphics (visual display) interfaces, a subject's desired trajectory can be determined and the movement errors can be amplified in real-time with dramatic results. This project evaluates a practical approach of error augmentation, using therapist-driven trajectories. The investigators intend to determine clinical efficacy of several types of therapist-assisted error augmentation on retraining the nervous system in functional activities. The investigators will test two experimental treatments in a crossover design. The investigators hypothesize that combined haptic and visual error augmentation will lead to the best functional recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","error augmentation","arm recovery","massed practice"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Error Augmentation-Control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Error Augmentation"]},{"label":"Control-Error Augmentation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Error Augmentation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Error Augmentation","description":"error augmentation for arm motor recovery in individuals with stroke","armGroupLabels":["Control-Error Augmentation","Error Augmentation-Control"],"otherNames":["Error Augmentation-Control","Control-Error Augmentation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Arm motor recovery scores on the Fugl-Meyer","description":"Change from baseline in arm motor recovery as measured by Fugl-Meyer","timeFrame":"Change from baseline in Fugl-Meyer to 11 weeks (with assessment periods occurring at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, and 11 weeks for ARM 1;
