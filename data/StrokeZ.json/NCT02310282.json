Patients with small vessel stroke tend have a better prognosis than those with large artery disease. Further, patients with small artery infarction (lacunar stroke) have shown to respond well to treatment with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA), but are poor candidates for endovascular recanalization. Conversely, IV rt-PA may be less effective at restoring perfusion of large artery occlusion, a stroke subtype that may benefit from intra-arterial thrombolysis or embolectomy. Similarly, patients with large intracerebral hemorrhage or cerebellar hemorrhage may require neurosurgical interventions, such as intracranial pressure monitoring, ventricular drainage, surgical evacuation, or hemicraniectomy.\n\nThe purpose of TeleCLASS is to evaluate the discriminatory value of the Unassisted TeleStroke Scale (UTSS) obtained through in-hospital telemedicine for differentiation between patients with lacunar stroke and those with other acute stroke syndromes (nonLACS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Telemedicine","Emergency
