One hundred and twenty patients with hemiplegia as a consequence of an ischaemic stroke will take part in the study. Selection criteria included to be older than 65 years, with two months of evolution after the stroke and with the left paretic side. In addition, they had to have a positive diagnosis of COVID-19. Positive cases will be confirmed by PCR. Due to the local sanitary regulations, all patients may require home confinement during 1 month without possibility to continue their rehabilitation program.\n\nPhysiological interventions started 20 days after the first negative PCR test.\n\nParticipants will be randomize in three different intervention groups, conventional therapy (n=40), carried out in the Hospital, biofeedback therapy (n=40), also conducted in the Hospital, and Telephyisiotherapy (TP) plus physical activity (n=40). The intervention period will last for three months, and participants will be re-evaluated 30 days later to confirm treatment effectiveness.\n\nMeasurements\n\nElectromyographic activity and hand strength The mean electromyographic (EMG) activity will be determined with the Neurotrans Myoplus 2 Pro System (Verity Medical Ltd, UK), the same instrument used to carry out the intervention. The isometric strength (Nw) of the hand will be assessed with a hand-held digital dynamometer (Smedley digital hand dynamometer, RMS Ltd., UK).\n\nFunctional tests In the present work, the Fugl-Meyer will be used to determine the functional status of patients with stroke. The patients with better functionality had superior scores. In addition, the ability of the patients to perform basic daily living activities was determined through the Barthel index. Considering the advanced age of the participants, three extra-scales will be determined: the FRAIL scale, the short physical performance battery (SPPB) and the Strength, assistance in walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs and falls (SARC-F) scale will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia","Muscle Spasticity"],"keywords":["hemiplegia","stroke","telephyisiotherapy","older adults"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups of patients with post-stroke hemiplegia will be treated only with conventional physiotherapy (CONTROL) or with physiotherapy plus telecare (INTERVENTION).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Two groups of patients with post-stroke hemiplegia will be treated only with conventional physiotherapy or with physiotherapy plus telecare.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Conventional phyisiotherapy + telecare","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Physiotherapy + telephysiotherapty"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional physiotherapy","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Physiotherapy + telephysiotherapty"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Physiotherapy + telephysiotherapty","description":"Patients assigned to the telephyisiotherapy (TP) group will carry out a half-hour session of conventional therapy, plus a 1-hour session of physical exercise, which will be carried out through the administration of tutorial videos, telephone instructions or by email.","armGroupLabels":["Control","Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in muscle activity","description":"Main outcome will be changes in electromyogrpahic activity.
