Anxiety and depression will demotivate the patients' will to undergo rehabilitation program, which would delay their functional recovery. The influence of acupressure over the auricle on the HRV, anxiousness and depressive mood have yet to be verified. The investigators aimed to study the effect on auricular acupressure treatment between the different trending of HRV, anxiety and depression and their correlations.\n\nThis is a randomized control study, consisted of 70 patients with post-stroke depressive mood, from both CGH and Xizhi Cathay hospital in Taiwan. HRV analysis is performed on the first 24 hours, and on a weekly basis for a total of 6 weeks. The included depressed patients were defined by the \"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\" and weekly will be undertaken by the patients. A \"Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire\" pre-test and after-test will be undertaken by the patients. Experimental group will receive acupressure treatment by the second week, trice daily, 3\\~5minutes each session for a course of four weeks. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0, using generalized estimating equation, GEE.\n\nThe study hypothesized that the auricular acupressure treatment would improve post-stroke depression. Therefore, participants would be more willing to receive rehabilitation program. Our study would also help to provide future references on related studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Depression","Auricular Acupressure"],"keywords":["stroke","heart rate variability","autonomic nerve","auricular acupressure","depression","anxiety"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental group will receive acupressure treatment by the second week, trice daily, 3\\~5minutes each session for a course of four weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: auricular acupressure"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Experimental group will receive routine care for a course of four weeks."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"auricular acupressure","description":"Auricular therapy, as defined by Oleson, refers to \"a healthcare modality by stimulating the external surface of the ear to alleviate pathological conditions in other parts of the body\"Experimental group will receive acupressure treatment by the second week, trice daily, 3\\~5minutes each session for a course of four weeks","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire","description":"The Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire(TDQ), which is a 4-point scale with 18 items, is a culturally specific depression self-rating instrument for effective screening of depression in Taiwan and has satisfactory reliability and validity.

The original test authors defined three ranges for both of the scales: 0-13 (non-cases), 14-18 (doubtful cases), and 19-54(cases).

Seven of the items indicate anxiety and the remaining seven items indicate depression. Each item had been answered by the patient on a four point (0-3) response category so the possible scores ranged from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression.\n\nThe original test authors defined three ranges for both of the scales: 0-7 (non-cases), 8-10 (doubtful cases), and 11-21(cases).
