This disease is the third leading cause of death after ischemic heart disease and cancer. Stroke is also the leading cause of disability in adults. It is known that stroke individuals have not only limb restriction, but also respiratory capacity and exercise capacity. It has been shown in the literature that upper extremity functions are directly related to respiratory capacity. Although it is known that upper extremity training has positive effects on respiratory capacity in stroke individuals, more studies are needed to examine the effects of upper extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation on respiratory capacity. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of upper extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation applied in addition to conventional treatment on respiratory parameters, dyspnea, and functional capacity.","detailedDescription":"One of the most common complications in stroke patients is pulmonary aspiration and pneumonia, which are associated with respiratory functions being affected. Fluoroscopic examinations of stroke patients showed decreased movement in the diaphragm as well as in other muscles on the affected side. The combination of a decrease in respiratory parameters, weakness in respiratory muscles, and a decrease in diaphragmatic activity can cause dyspnea in individuals even that require minimal effort. The low level of physical activity is accompanied by a decrease in respiratory functions, and the participation of individuals in society decreases. The purpose of stroke rehabilitation is to reduce the complications caused by stroke and to increase the individual's psychological, social, physical, and professional level of independence and functionality to the highest level. Nowadays, stroke rehabilitation can be shaped by a variety of methods. In clinics, robotic rehabilitation is commonly used for stroke patients with the development of the technology. In the literature, studies show the effect of robotic rehabilitation on respiratory parameters, also robot-assisted walking training provides significant improvement in some respiratory parameters and increases aerobic capacity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of upper extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation applied in addition to conventional treatment on respiratory parameters, dyspnea, and functional capacity in individuals with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["robot-assisted training","respiratory parameters"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessor will be blind to group allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to conventional treatment, an upper extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation program will be applied for 45 minutes a day, two days a week.","interventionNames":["Other: Robot-assisted rehabilitation","Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group will be included in a conventional rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robot-assisted rehabilitation","description":"In addition to conventional treatment, an upper extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation program.
