Current clinical practice is generally to accept high blood pressure in the acute phase of stroke, to avoid reduction of cerebral blood perfusion. This practice has a well-founded theoretical basis, but is not supported by evidence from clinical trials. The newly published study ACCESS (Stroke 2003;34:1699) showed a clear beneficial effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan in the acute phase of stroke, but the trial was seriously underpowered.\n\nThe Scandinavian Candesartan Acute Stroke Trial (SCAST) is designed to provide reliable data on the effects of candesartan in a wide variety of patients with acute stroke (target recruitment 2,500). Patients presenting with acute stroke (\\<30 hours) and systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg will be randomly assigned to candesartan 4 to 16 mg once daily or matching placebo for 7 days, followed by candesartan treatment for 6 months for patients who are hypertensive at the end of the treatment period (at clinician's discretion). Follow-up will be performed double-blind at 30 days, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe trial is co-ordinated from Ullevaal University Hospital in Oslo, Norway. Over 100 centres from Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium have agreed to participate. Financial contributors: The Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, AstraZeneca, and Ullevaal University Hospital (Oslo). AstraZeneca will supply drugs and placebo for the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute stroke","Elevated blood pressure","Blood pressure lowering treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Candesartan Cilexetil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Candesartan Cilexetil","interventionNames":["Drug: Candesartan Cilexetil"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Candesartan Cilexetil","description":"4 mg on day 1; 8 mg on day 2; 16 mg on days 3-7","armGroupLabels":["Candesartan Cilexetil"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"4 mg on day 1; 8 mg on day 2; 16 mg on days 3-7","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death or major disability (defined by the modified Rankin scale) at 6 months","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"The composite event \"vascular\" death, myocardial infarction, or stroke during the first 6 months","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Scandinavian Stroke Scale score at 7 days","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Barthel Index score at 6 months","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"EuroQol score at 6 months","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Mini-Mental State score at 6 months","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Death (all-cause death and \"vascular\" death)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Recurrent stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or unspecified)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Combination of the above events","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Symptomatic hypotension","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Renal failure","timeFrame":"7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical stroke syndrome with limb paresis, not likely to represent a transient ischaemic attack or non-stroke pathology (e.g. cerebral tumour)\n* Systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg\n* Trial treatment possible within 30 hrs of symptom onset.
