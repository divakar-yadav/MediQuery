Both groups conduct 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session will consist a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and axial mobility exercises. After this, both groups will perform more 30 minutes of balance training using eight Wii Fit games which stimulate motor and cognitive functions.\n\nThe main outcome measures will be: the lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE); Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Postural Balance","Motor Function","Gait","Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy","Physiotherapist"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single blinded (outcomes assessor)","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No Physiotherapeutic Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Virtual reality training without physiotherapeutic intervention","interventionNames":["Other: No Physiotherapeutic Intervention"]},{"label":"Physiotherapeutic Intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Virtual reality training with physiotherapeutic intervention","interventionNames":["Other: Physiotherapeutic Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No Physiotherapeutic Intervention","description":"Experimental group will perform a balance training program in a virtual environment (using a gaming system with balance board device - eight games of Nintendo Wii Fit®, for 14 sessions) without verbal/manual physiotherapeutic intervention.\n\nInitially, instructions about the rules and strategies of how to play the game and control the avatar will be provided.\n\nThen the patient will be invited to start the game, and in the two attempts of the training no manual or verbal assistance will be provided.

It includes 36 items that evaluate performance of 6 balance systems: biomechanical constraints, stability limits/verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation, and stability in gait.","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE)","description":"FMA-LE is a subscale measuring lower limb motor recovery. It examines movement and coordination of the hip, knee, and ankle in the supine, sitting, and standing positions. Each item is scored on a 3-point scale (0, cannot perform; 1, partially performs; 2, performs fully). The score range is 0 to 34, with higher scores indicating better lower limb motor performance","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months"},{"measure":"6-minute walk test","description":"The 6MWT is a practical simple test. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). The 6MWT has been used as a measure of functional status of patients.","timeFrame":"Up to three months"},{"measure":"Limits of Stability","description":"The Limits of Stability subtest quantifies the maximum distance a person can intentionally displace their center of pressure (COP) from start position of midline COP centered over the base of support to eight targets. Location and movement of the COP was indicated by a cursor display projected on a screen in front of the subject. As targets were highlighted, the subject was to move the COP cursor quickly and accurately as possible towards a target located on the Limits of Stability perimeter and hold position as close to the target as possible. The parameters include COP movement velocity and directional control (% to target).","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months"},{"measure":"Rhythmic Weight Shift","description":"The Rhythmic Weight Shift quantifies the subject's active weight shift ability by moving the COP cursor to match velocity and direction of a moving visual target in the medial- lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions at three different velocities.","timeFrame":"Up to three months"},{"measure":"Stroke Speciﬁc quality of life scale","description":"Stroke Quality of Life Scale is a self-report assessment that includes 12 stroke subscales with 49 items. The Stroke Speciﬁc Quality of Life Scale attempts to capture the domains of stroke QOL that are insufficiently assessed with generic QOL measures. The 12 subscales, which are unidimensional, are Energy, Family Role, Language, Mobility, Mood, Personality, Self-Care, Social Roles, Thinking, Upper Extremity Function, Vision, and Work-Productivity. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale. Domain scores are the averages of the item scores, and the total score is the average of the domain scores. All summary scores therefore range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate better function.","timeFrame":"Up to three months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* hemiparetic status resulting from a single stroke at least 6 months earlier;\n* the ability to walk 10 m independently with or without an assistive device;\n* a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of ≥ 20;\n* the absence of a musculoskeletal condition that could potentially affect the ability to stand or walk safely;\n* the absence of serious visual impairment or a hearing disorder;\n* muscle strength ≥ 3 in lower limbs;\n* ability to understand and follow simple instructions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe dementia or aphasia;\n* hemispatial neglect, ataxia or any other cerebellar symptom;\n* inability to stand without minimal assist;\n* uncontrollable medical complications\n* participation in other studies or rehabilitation programs","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Maria Elisa P Piemonte, PT, PhD","affiliation":"University of São Paulo","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Mariana A Lourenço, PT,Ms Student","affiliation":"University of São Paulo","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Tatiana P Oliveira, PT,PhD Student","affiliation":"University of São Paulo","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Camila S Miranda, PT, MS","affiliation":"University of São Paulo","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Physiotherapy, Communication Science & Disorders, Occupational Therapy, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo","city":"Sao Paulo","state":"SP","zip":"05360-160","country":"Brazil","geoPoint":{"lat":-23.5475,"lon":-46.63611}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17903971","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Adamson J, Beswick A, Ebrahim S.
