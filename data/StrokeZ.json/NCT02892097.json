This study is designed to determine the effects of tDCS + RTP on the excitability in the brain, attention to the affected side, and arm movement ability.","detailedDescription":"Unilateral neglect (neglect) is common after stroke and is characterized by an inattention to one side of the body or environment. There is growing evidence that disconnections to fronto-parietal neural networks in the lesioned hemisphere not only cause neglect, but also cause these same networks to be hyperexcited in the non-lesioned hemisphere. Individuals with neglect typically experience motor impairments also since the regions of the brain that control attention also control movement.\n\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) when paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP) has the potential to modulate cortical activity (fronto-parietal networks) and facilitate motor and attentional recovery for individuals with neglect since tDCS can modulate the excitability of targeted cortical regions. tDCS is a form on non-invasive brain stimulation and RTP is the gold standard post-stroke motor recovery intervention.\n\nIt is particularly important investigators examine the effect of RTP + tDCS on cortical modulation in order to understand the underlying mechanism of the intervention and determine whether RTP+ tDCS (parietal or primary motor cortex \\[M1\\]) promotes greater neural modulation than RTP alone. Traditionally, electrodes are placed on M1 to facilitate motor recovery and on the parietal lobe to facilitate attentional recovery, however this intervention is designed to target each of these impairments (motor, attention) and enhance cortical modulation of fronto-parietal networks. Therefore, investigators must also determine the optimal electrode montage and placement for pairing tDCS with RTP for individuals with neglect.\n\nThe purpose of the proposed pilot project is to examine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP) on modulation of fronto-parietal network connectivity (measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation \\[TMS\\]), motor impairment (measured with kinematic assessment), and attentional impairment (measured with Behavioral Inattention Test) among individuals with unilateral neglect and hemiparesis post stroke. This three day cross-over design study will examine the optimal electrode placement and montage using 3 conditions: (1) tDCS to parietal lobe + RTP (2) tDCS to primary motor cortex + RTP (3) sham tDCS + RTP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemispatial Neglect"],"keywords":["tDCS","neglect","paresis","transcranial direct current stimulation","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Parietal tDCS plus RTP","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Single session of bilateral parietal tDCS (2.0 mA for 30 minutes) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP).","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Behavioral: Repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)"]},{"label":"Primary motor cortex tDCS plus RTP","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Single session of bilateral primary motor cortex tDCS (2.0 mA for 30 minutes) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Behavioral: Repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS plus RTP","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Single session of sham tDCS (for 30 minutes) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)","interventionNames":["Device: sham tDCS","Behavioral: Repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"tDCS is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation.
