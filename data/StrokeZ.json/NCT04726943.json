The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous leak closure with radiofrequency energy applications.","detailedDescription":"Therapies locally targeting the LAA via occlusion, exclusion, or excision have emerged as an alternative and effective approach for stroke prophylaxis in AF patients, especially those with OAC contra-indications. Despite mounting evidence of their safety and efficacy in comparison with standard oral therapy, device-related thrombus and incomplete LAA closure resulting in residual, significant leak may occur, potentially hindering an effective stroke prevention. Radiofrequency energy has been adopted in several settings (e.g., vascular, orthopedic, aesthetic surgery) to achieve thermal-induced tissue retraction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Left Atrial Appendage Thrombosis","Stroke, Ischemic","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["stroke","atrial fibrillation","left atrial appendage","prevention","leak","radiofrequency"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RF Energy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RF delivery targeting the atrial side of a significant residual leak in patients with acute and chronic evidence of incomplete percutaneous LAA occlusion","interventionNames":["Procedure: Radiofrequency Energy Applications"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Radiofrequency Energy Applications","description":"RF energy applications to the atrial edge of a leak resulting from incomplete LAA occlusion","armGroupLabels":["RF Energy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Procedural Success","description":"Complete LAA occlusion or presence of a mild/minimal peri-device leak on FU TEE","timeFrame":"1-3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Peri-Procedural Success","description":"Complete LAA occlusion or presence of mild/minimal (1-2 mm) residual leak assessed via multiplane color Doppler imaging on TEE/ICE at the end of the procedure","timeFrame":"Peri-Procedural"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
