The objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate whether combination of pioglitazone and a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, compared with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, reduces recurrent stroke in diabetic patients with recent ischemic stroke.\n\nMethods and analysis: The trial is a randomized, parallel-group study conducted at 7 hospitals in Taiwan. Inclusion criteria are adult patients with a history of ischemic stroke within 3 months, diabetes mellitus with Hba1C \\> 7%, taking metformin currently or previously, and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Eligible patients who sign the informed consent forms will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either combination of pioglitazone and an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin or canagliflozin) vs. a DPP4 inhibitor. Primary outcome is change in HbA1C between 6 months and baseline in active vs comparator groups. Additional biomarker outcomes are change in hs-CRP insulin resistance, B type natriuretic peptide, and urine albumin creatinine ratio between 6 months and baseline.\n\nEthics and dissemination Study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi Branch, Taiwan (201702353A3, 201802340A3 and 201902176A3). All participants will be required to sign and date an informed consent form. Study findings will be disseminated via a peer-reviewed journal."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus","Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","diabetes mellitus","sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitor","pioglitazone"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"metformin+pioglitazone+an SGLT2 inhibitor","interventionNames":["Drug: Metformin plus Pioglitazone plus an SGLT2 inhibitor"]},{"label":"Control arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"metformin + DPP4 inhibitors","interventionNames":["Drug: Metformin plus Pioglitazone plus an SGLT2 inhibitor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Metformin plus Pioglitazone plus an SGLT2 inhibitor","description":"Patients assigned to active group will stop their prior oral antidiabetic drugs and receive combination of metformin, pioglitazone, and an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin or canagliflozin) and dose will be adjusted by their physicians.","armGroupLabels":["Active arm","Control arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"HbA1C","description":"blood test to evaluate glycemic control","timeFrame":"6 months from baseline in active vs control arms"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"UACR","description":"to evaluate microalbuminuria","timeFrame":"6 months from randomization in active vs control arms"},{"measure":"hs-CRP","description":"to evaluate hs-CRP in active vs control arms","timeFrame":"6 months from randomization"},{"measure":"NT-proBNP","description":"to evaluate NT-proBNP in active vs control arms","timeFrame":"6 months from randomization"},{"measure":"insulin resistance","description":"Insulin resistance will be evaluated by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)","timeFrame":"6 months from randomization"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
