Normally older people have a stroke, but also a significant number of younger people between 18 and 55 years. Usually, these can only be explained for a minority by the classical risk factors such as diabetes, overweight and high blood pressure. New studies indicate that in about 1 - 2 % of the younger stroke patients the etiology can be an undiagnosed genetic disease, e.g. Fabry disease. Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder known to cause vasculopathy. The purpose of this study is to determine in a large number of young stroke patients, how many strokes were caused by Fabry disease and what risk factors might be able to predict this disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke, Acute","Cerebral Stroke"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Cerebrovascular Accident, Acute","Fabry Disease","Fabry´s Disease","Anderson-Fabry Disease","CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","Stroke, Acute","Cerebral Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Fabry diagnostic will be done centrally: blood samples will be stored for analysis of a-galactosidase in blood, Gb3 as well as lyso-Gb3.
