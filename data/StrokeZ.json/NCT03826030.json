The stimulation technique is called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The treatment uses direct currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain affected by stroke. The adjunctive rehabilitation therapy is called \"modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy\" (mCIMT). During this therapy the subject will wear a mitt on the hand of the arm that was not affected by a stroke and force to use the weak arm. The study will test 3 different doses of brain stimulation in combination with mCIMT to find out the most promising one."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Motor Activity","Upper Extremity Paralysis"],"keywords":["stroke","stroke recovery","brain stimulation","transcranial direct current stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":129,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sham tDCS + mCIMT","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham tDCS (Transcranial direct current stimulation) administers no dose or zero milliampere stimulation through the tDCS device, during Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT)","interventionNames":["Device: Sham","Behavioral: mCIMT"]},{"label":"2 mA tDCS + mCIMT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"2 mA tDCS (Transcranial direct current stimulation) administers low dose or 2 milliampere stimulation through the tDCS device, during Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT)","interventionNames":["Device: Low dose tDCS","Behavioral: mCIMT"]},{"label":"4 mA + mCIMT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"4 mA tDCS (Transcranial direct current stimulation) administers high dose or 4 milliampere stimulation through the tDCS device, during Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT)","interventionNames":["Device: High dose tDCS","Behavioral: mCIMT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham","description":"sham group receives no active current stimulation except 15 seconds of current ramp up in the beginning and 15 seconds of current ramp up in the end of the 30-minute session to create a scalp perception to blind the subject.","armGroupLabels":["Sham tDCS + mCIMT"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low dose tDCS","description":"The low dose tDCS group receives direct current stimulation at 2 mA for 30 minutes per session","armGroupLabels":["2 mA tDCS + mCIMT"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High dose tDCS","description":"The high dose tDCS group receives direct current stimulation at 4 mA for 30 minutes per session","armGroupLabels":["4 mA + mCIMT"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"mCIMT","description":"All three tDCS groups receive constraint-induced movement therapy as the adjunctive behavioral therapy for 2 hours per session","armGroupLabels":["2 mA tDCS + mCIMT","4 mA + mCIMT","Sham tDCS + mCIMT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Change of Motor Impairment as Assessed by Fugl-Meyer Upper-Extremity (FM-UE) scale","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Upper-Extremity (FM-UE) scale is a measure of motor impairment.
