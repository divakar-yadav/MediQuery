Nevertheless, much remained uncertain about the implementation of scientific evidence of EVT into real-world benefits. For instance, healthcare policies that influence critical time-matrices, endovascular thrombectomy techniques that may enhance success rate or prevent complications, or advanced imaging techniques that allow precise prognosis or expansion of treatment populations, should be evaluated. On the other hand, capturing LVO patients who were not able to undergo EVT may reveal the gap between clinical trials and real-world practice in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn this multicenter prospective collaboration across the Asian-Pacific, the investigators aim to evaluate the determinants of effective EVT in the real-world setting.","detailedDescription":"In this multicenter, prospective, longitudinal study, the investigators aim to evaluate the determinants of effective EVT in the real-world setting.\n\nThe investigators shall recruit patient who are over 18 years of age, with ischemic stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO), defined as occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), M1 or M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), or basilar artery (BA).\n\nDetailed study procedures are as follows:\n\n1. As the EVT center of the New Territory East Cluster (NTEC), all patients who undergo EVT triage in the NTEC, i.e. patients with suspected LVO, would be assessed by neuro-interventionists from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH). Eligibility screening for recruitment under the ENDURE-APAC registry will be carried out simultaneously.\n2. The investigators shall obtain informed consent either from patient or next-of-kin. Informed consent will be obtained from his/her legal guardian or next-of-kin for those incompetent subjects who are willing to participate in the study. Subjects will be reconsented when competent.\n3. After the informed consent, a study identity number will be assigned to each participant. The investigators shall obtain the following data:\n\n   1. Demographic data such as age, gender, date of birth, smoking and drinking habit, pre-morbid functional status (by modified Rankin Scale (mRS)).\n   2. Co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, previous strokes, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, etc.\n   3. Concurrent medications including anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, heparin, warfarin), antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, cilostazol), lipid-lowering agents (simvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, ezetimibe, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, erenumab), antihypertensive (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, nitrates, etc.), cytochrome P450 or P-glycoprotein inhibitors (amiodarone, dronedarone, phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, rifampicin, cyclosporin, etc.), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or cyclo-oxygenase2 inhibitors (indomethacin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib, etorixocib), glucose lowering drugs (metformin, gliclazide, glimepiride, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, insulin, exenatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide).\n   4. Radiological findings, treatment outcomes and complications (see 2.3.2 and 2.3.4.) will be documented.\n   5. Baseline hemoglobin, white blood cell, platelet count, creatinine, sodium, potassium, alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride level, prothrombin time, activated thromboplastin time, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c will be documented."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Stroke","Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Ischemic","Brain Diseases","Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Physical, histology, biochemical or protein expressions of the thrombi obtained from thrombectomy procedures may contain information regarding the etiology of stroke and relevant disease pathology.
