All patients will receive one-third starvation fluid as crystalloid during first hour of surgery . Night prior to and on the day of surgery carbo load will be given to all patients according to the protocol.Monitoring included 5 lead ECG SPO2,ETCO2, Invasive Blood Pressure (IBP - Radial),CVP(site IJV),core Temperature .\n\nStandard General anaesthesia with oral Endotracheal tube and Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation will be given to all patients.Patients will be allotted randomly to either Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) /SVV - Stroke Volume Variation or Conventional Central Venous Pressure - CVP guided fluid Therapy Group.\n\nDuring the surgery - Heart rate , Mean arterial Blood Pressure , Urine output , Blood loss , Seum lactate levels will be noted.\n\nFor SVV Group - SVV , Stroke Volume Index (SVI) , Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) ,Cardiac Index (CI) values will be noted every 30 minutes- the goal is to maintain SVV value \\>11 and to give colloid bolus 200ml whenever SVV values rise above11.Pre and post bolus SVV, SV, SVI and SVRI shall be recorded.\n\nFor CVP Group - Goal is to maintain CVP values between 8-12 cmsH20 and for decrease in value \\< 8 colloid bolus of 200ml will be given and change in CVP value will be noted.\n\nPatients in both the groups will receive Noradrenaline infusion if MAP \\<70 mmHg with optimal fluid transfusion .Target for transfusing Packed red blood cells will be value of haematocrit \\< 24 Postoperative HR, MAP, I/O-charting, Serum Creatinine, Serum Lactate, bowel sounds, Inotrope requirement, Visual Analogue Score, Ryles Tube Feeds, Epidural analgesia ,Length of stay (hours in SICU) and any postoperative complications shall be noted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid Loss","Enhanced Recovery"],"keywords":["Goal Directed Fluid Therapy","Stroke volume variation","Enhanced recovery after surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients in Conventional Group will be given intraoperative fluids guided by CVP Values .\n\nPatients in GDFT Group will be given fluids guided by SVV values.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participant will be masked about allotment of interventional group either CVP or SVV .","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intraoperative Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) guided by Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"When SVV values will increase above 11 colloid bolus 200ml will be administered. postbolus change in values of SVV , SV , SVI and CI shall be noted.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Goal directed Fluid Therapy"]},{"label":"Intraoperative Conventional Fluid Therapy (CFT) guided by Central Venous Pressure (CVP) .","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"When CVP values will decrease below 8 cmsH20 colloid bolus 200ml will be administered .Postbolus change in values shall be noted .","interventionNames":["Procedure: Conventional Fluid Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Goal directed Fluid Therapy","description":"Patients will receive fluid during surgery with goal of maintaining SVV below 11","armGroupLabels":["Intraoperative Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) guided by Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Conventional Fluid Therapy","description":"Patients will receive fluid during surgery with goal of maintaining CVP between 8-12 cms H20","armGroupLabels":["Intraoperative Conventional Fluid Therapy (CFT) guided by Central Venous Pressure (CVP) ."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Duration of ICU stay","description":"Time of shifting of patients in both group to the ward in hours.","timeFrame":"upto 5 days ."},{"measure":"Postoperative serum Lactate levels mmol/L","description":"Serum lactate levels will be measured in the SICU","timeFrame":"upto 48 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serum Creatinine levels mg/dL.","description":"Serum Creatinine levels will be measured in the SICU .","timeFrame":"Upto 48 hours."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Elective major open gastrointestinal Oncosurgeries .\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient refusal.\n* Robotic surgery.\n* Laparoscopic surgery.\n* Arrythmias.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Anita Kulkarni, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+91 9891064785","email":"anitackulkarni@gmail.com"},{"name":"Shagun Bhatia, DNB","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+91 9891769779","email":"drshagun_2010@rediffmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Anita Kulkarni, MD","affiliation":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre , Delhi , India","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Anita Kulkarni","status":"RECRUITING","city":"New Delhi","state":"Please Select","zip":"110078","country":"India","contacts":[{"name":"Anita Kulkarni, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+91 9891064785","email":"anitackulkarni@gmail.com"},{"name":"Shagun Bhatia, DNB","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+91 9891769779","email":"drshagun_2010@rediffmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":28.63576,"lon":77.22445}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29369117","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Chong MA, Wang Y, Berbenetz NM, McConachie I.
