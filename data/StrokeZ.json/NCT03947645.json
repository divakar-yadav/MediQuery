All patients will take part in two blocks of high-intense motor training with concurrent neuromuscular stimulation of the paretic upper extremity. In a randomized, cross-over block design, patients will receive transcranial stimulation of either the ipsi- or contralesional hemisphere.\n\nThe primary outcome measure is the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FM-UE), acquired at baseline, after the intervention period, and at 3 months follow-up.
