However, doctors do not know whether minocycline will work in stroke patients. Its use in stroke patients is experimental. There is a lot of information from experimental stroke studies in animals that minocycline lessens the damage from a stroke and the animals recover better. Since minocycline is generally a very safe drug in humans and does not have a lot of side effects, investigators at Georgia Health Sciences University (formerly the Medical College of Georgia) believe that it might be a safe and effective drug to improve the outcome in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["stroke","ischemic","neuroprotection","minocycline","tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)","biomarkers","pharmacokinetics","antiapoptotic","anti-inflammatory","treatment","matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)","thrombolysis","Minocycline to Improve Neurologic Outcome in Stroke (MINOS)","cerebrovascular stroke","cerebrovascular accident","cerebral stroke","cerebrovascular accident (CVA)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Minocycline","description":"Dose level 1 = 3mg/kg intravenous (IV) initial dose, followed by 1.5mg/kg every 12 hours times 5 more doses.\n\nDose level 2 = 4.5mg/kg intravenous (IV) initial dose, followed by 2.25mg/kg every 12 hours times 5 more doses.\n\nDose level 3 = 6 mg/kg intravenous (IV) initial dose, followed by 3 mg/kg every 12 hours times 5 more doses.\n\nDose level 4 = 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) initial dose, followed by 5 mg/kg every 12 hours times 5 more doses","otherNames":["Minomycin","Minocycline hydrochloride","Minocycline hydrochloride injection","Minomycin Intravenous (for drip use)","Minomycin Intravenous","MINO"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximally Tolerated Dose of IV Minocycline","description":"Investigators closely monitored each subject for evidence of minocycline intolerance.
