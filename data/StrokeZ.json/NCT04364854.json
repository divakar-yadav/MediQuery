One of the most debilitating types of aphasia is non-fluent aphasia. Non-fluent aphasia is defined by significantly reduced speech production, with the speaker producing only a few words or even less. Speech entrainment therapy (SET) is a treatment that has been shown to increase fluency in people with non-fluent aphasia. The study looks to define the best dose of SET that leads to sustained improvements in spontaneous speech production.\n\nParticipants who are eligible will undergo baseline language testing, an MRI, and will be randomized into one of 4 treatment groups: SET for 3 weeks, SET for 4.5 weeks, SET for 6 weeks, and no treatment (control group)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Aphasia Non Fluent","Stroke"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Speech Language Pathology","Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 3 weeks","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 3 weeks"]},{"label":"SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 4.5 weeks","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 4.5 weeks"]},{"label":"SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 6 weeks","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 6 weeks"]},{"label":"No Therapy 6 weeks","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: No Therapy 6 Weeks"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 3 weeks","description":"3 weeks of SET which consists of practicing fluent speech in real time with an audio-visual computer program","armGroupLabels":["SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 3 weeks"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 4.5 weeks","description":"4.5 weeks of SET which consists of practicing fluent speech in real time with an audio-visual computer program","armGroupLabels":["SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 4.5 weeks"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 6 weeks","description":"6 weeks of SET which consists of practicing fluent speech in real time with an audio-visual computer program","armGroupLabels":["SET (Speech Entrainment Therapy) 6 weeks"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"No Therapy 6 Weeks","description":"Participants will not be getting any SET for 6 weeks","armGroupLabels":["No Therapy 6 weeks"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Verbs Per Minute (VPM) in Speech Sample","description":"VPM will be assessed through procedural storytelling and narrative story telling tasks - with four items in each category.
