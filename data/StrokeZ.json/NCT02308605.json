The investigators propose a simple blood test of substances (the purines) that result from cellular metabolism and are produced in excess when brain cells are starved of oxygen and glucose (as occurs during a stroke).","detailedDescription":"In this study, the investigators propose to use newly developed biosensor technology (SMARTCap) to directly address whether purines are indicators of real strokes, and can distinguish strokes from other conditions with similar symptoms, more rapidly."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["SMARTCap"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":217,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Suspected stroke patients and subset","description":"Blood samples taken on admission and at 24 hours, MRI scan between 24 and 48 hours\n\nSubset: Blood samples repeated once per hour for six hours","interventionNames":["Device: SMARTCap"]},{"label":"Control participants (relatives)","description":"To donate blood on two occasions, 24 hours apart, to draw comparison with stroke patients","interventionNames":["Device: SMARTCap"]},{"label":"Feeding control participants","description":"To donate a baseline blood sample, eat a simple purine rich meal (meat sandwich), then donate 4 more blood samples at 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes following the meal","interventionNames":["Device: SMARTCap"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SMARTCap","description":"The Sarissa Biomedical SMARTCap biosensor array.
