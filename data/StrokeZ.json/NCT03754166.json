This mechanism of \"learned non-use\" would be due to a cognitive process decreasing the use of the AA and could partly explain that 75% of patients maintain an upper limb deficit at 3-6 month post-stroke.\n\nIn order to combat this phenomenon, a bottom up method (sensorimotor action on the deficit) of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been developed and consists in immobilizing the unaffected arm to force the use of the AA.\n\nThis technique has proved its effectiveness in the chronic phase and has also recently been proven to improve motor performance in the acute phase. Transposing progress on ADL, however, remains difficult because CIMT does not contain adequate behavioral strategies.\n\nTo help the patient mobilize these strategies, coupling of CIMT with a top-down method (conscious action on motor skills) has been successfully tested as an intervention of an occupational therapist with the patient at least 1h / day. This intervention remains not compatible with the investigators care organization because the caregiver can not spend that amount of time with each patient.\n\nInvestigators therefore propose to associate CIMT with another top down technique: visual-spatial cueing (use of panels and/or visual messages to encourage the conscious use of the AA) and investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment on learning transfer to ADL.\n\nThe objective of our study will be to test the feasibility of setting up such an intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Constraint-induced movement therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient's unaffected arm is restrained, by a glove including thumb, during activities of daily life (bathing, grooming, dressing and feeding = approx. 4h/day).\n\nVisual spatial cueing is displayed in the bedroom and the bathroom.","interventionNames":["Other: Constraint-induced movement therapy"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual care of the neurovascular unit. = No constraint, no cueing, and same physiotherapy intervention as experimental arm."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Constraint-induced movement therapy","description":"Patient's unaffected arm is restrained, by a glove including thumb, during activities of daily life (bathing, grooming, dressing and feeding = approx. 4h/day).\n\nVisual spatial cueing is displayed in the bedroom and the bathroom.","armGroupLabels":["Constraint-induced movement therapy"],"otherNames":["Visual-spatial cueing : top down"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of tasks realized per protocol between the two arms","description":"Variances to a predetermined checklist","timeFrame":"Day 15"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Arm motor function","description":"Action Research Arm Test","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 15 and Month 3"},{"measure":"Pain evolution","description":"Use of Visual analogue scale to determine the degree of pain on a scale from 0 to 10 (0: meaning no pain, 10 being maximal tolerable pain)","timeFrame":"Day 0, Day 7, Day 15 and Month 3"},{"measure":"Anxiety and Depression evolution","description":"Use of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
