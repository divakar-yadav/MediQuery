Prevalence of basilar artery occlusion are not known. Although basilar artery occlusion has been reported in 2 per 1000 autopsy cases, basilar artery thrombosis may, in stroke registries, explain as many as 27% of ischemic strokes occurring in the posterior circulation.Various treatments were tried in groups of patients with vertebrobasilar territory infarction but evidence based was not cleared previous studies. Therefore, we conduct this study to evaluate the eficacy and safety of endovascular treatment in basilar artery occlusion stroke patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Basilar Artery Occlusion"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Basilar Artery Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":109,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Thromboectomy and rTPA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"use thromboectomy and rtpa for patient with basilar artery occlusion stroke in 24 hour","interventionNames":["Procedure: Thromboectomy"]},{"label":"rTPA( recombinant tissue plasminogen activator )","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"use rtpa for patient with basilar artery occlusion stroke in 24 hour"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Thromboectomy","description":"Thromboectomy in Basilar Artery Occlusion patients","armGroupLabels":["Thromboectomy and rTPA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS in patients wtih Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke after 24hour admission","description":"NIHSS in patients wtih Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke after 24hour admission","timeFrame":"24 hours from admission"},{"measure":"Survival rate in patients with Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke","description":"Survival rate in patients with Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke","timeFrame":"3 months from admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS in patients with Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke","description":"mRS in patients with Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke","timeFrame":"3 months from admission"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients admit to 115 hospital in 24h of Basilar Artery Occlusion Stroke\n* NIHSS \\> 4 points\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients refuse to participate in studies\n* Patients with contraindication of either rTPA or thromboectomy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"DUNG U Tran Nguyen","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0902610832","email":"uyendungtrannguyen@gmail.com"},{"name":"THANG H Nguyen, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"033962478"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"TUAN D Tran, MD","affiliation":"UMP university","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4155","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","asFound":"Basilar Artery Occlusion","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13539","name":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13538","name":"Plasminogen","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
