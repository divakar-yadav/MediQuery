Nevertheless, the minority of anesthesiologists use continous dynamic parameters like pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation and other to manage fluid status. There's a fast acting biomarker that can help anesthesiologist to diagnose and manage the volemic status and possibly guide the infusion therapy better.\n\nPro-ANP is a biomarker that reacts on atria strain and can be used in volemic status assessment in cardiac surgery patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid Overload","Fluid Loss","Volume Overload","Cardiac Disease","Cardiac Output, Low","Cardiac Output, High"],"keywords":["fluid responsiveness","fluid status","cardiac surgery","volemic status","pro-ANP","hemodynamic monitoring","functional test","teboul test","stroke volume variation","cardiac output"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cardiac surgery patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
