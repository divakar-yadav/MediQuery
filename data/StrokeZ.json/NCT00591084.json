Ginsenoside-Rd, a purified component from total saponins of Panax notoginseng, has a molecular formula of C48H82O18•3H2O with a molecular weight of 1001.2. Ginsenoside-Rd has been shown to inhibit receptor-operated Ca2+ influx through receptor-and-store-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCC) , attenuate oxidative stress in stroke, reduce the size of the cerebral infarction and preserve brain functioning in animal models of acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["randomized trial","ischemic stroke","Ginsenoside-Rd"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":199,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ginsenoside-Rd 10mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"both a ginsenoside-Rd injection (10mg/1ml/each) and a specific dilution (10%, 1ml trimethylene glycol) were respectively diluted by a specific dilution (10%, 9 ml trimethylene glycol) and then mixed.","interventionNames":["Drug: ginsenoside-Rd 10 mg"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"2 specific dilutions (10%, 1ml trimethylene glycol) were respectively diluted by 2 specific dilutions (10%, 9 ml trimethylene glycol) and then mixed.","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]},{"label":"ginsenoside-Rd 20mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 ginsenoside-Rd injections (10mg/1ml/each) were respectively diluted by 2 specific dilutions (10%, 9 ml trimethylene glycol) and then mixed","interventionNames":["Drug: ginsenoside-Rd 20mg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ginsenoside-Rd 10 mg","description":"infusion ginsenoside-Rd 10 mg (group A)once a day and continued for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["ginsenoside-Rd 10mg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"placebo","description":"infusion placebo (group B)once a day and continued for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"ginsenoside-Rd 20mg","description":"infusion of ginsenoside-Rd 20mg (group C) once a day and continued for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["ginsenoside-Rd 20mg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS scores","timeFrame":"15±1 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS scores","timeFrame":"8 days"},{"measure":"the Barthel index","timeFrame":"8 days"},{"measure":"the Barthel index","timeFrame":"15 days"},{"measure":"the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"15 days"},{"measure":"the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* between 18 to 75 years\n* the first episode\n* from onset to admission within 72 hours\n* NIHSS scores:5\\~22\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* had other intracranial pathologies (e.g., tumor, infection)\n* had a neurologic or psychiatric disease\n* had a coexisting condition that limited their life expectancy\n* had significant drug or alcohol misuse\n* had high-grade carotid artery stenosis for which surgery was planned\n* were pregnant or nursing\n* participated in a clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within the past 3 months\n* were unlikely to be available for follow-up","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Gang Zhao, MD","affiliation":"the Department of Neurology , Xijing Hospital;","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Xuedong Liu, MD","affiliation":"the Department of Neurology, Xijing Hospital;","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"the Department of Neurology , Xijing Hospital","city":"Xi'an","state":"Shaanxi","zip":"710032","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":34.25833,"lon":108.92861}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19236467","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Liu X, Xia J, Wang L, Song Y, Yang J, Yan Y, Ren H, Zhao G.
