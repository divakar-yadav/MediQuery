However, the functional impairment is not totally irreversible. Several mechanisms may involved in both the cortical and motor function recovery after onset of stroke, and most of them are related to changes of cortical perfusion and metabolism.\n\nMotor function recovery after stroke (especially middle cerebral artery territory lesion) frequently follow stereotypic pattern (brunnström stage).\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the relationship between motor cortex oxygenation/metabolism and motor function recovery after stroke. To seek if there is similar stereotypic pattern of motor cortex oxygenation/metabolism change during the recover stage after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Participants receive evaluations (1/week for 3 months period) of\n\n* motor function (Include: MMSE, brunnström stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance, Box and Block Test of Manual Dexterity, Functional Independence Measure)\n* cortical perfusion detection during performing limb movements (using NIRS)\n\nThen use path analysis to investigate the relationship between motor cortex oxygenation/metabolism and motor function recovery after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["cortical activation","motor function","activity of daily living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Functional Electric Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"perform arm cranking with functional electrical stimulation","interventionNames":["Procedure: Functional Electric Stimulation"]},{"label":"traditional rehabilitation program","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Receive traditional rehabilitation programs","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation programs"]},{"label":"Health","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"with no motor function impairment"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Functional Electric Stimulation","description":"apply to the hemiplegia affected limbs, helping movement","armGroupLabels":["Functional Electric Stimulation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation programs","description":"include occupational therapy and physical therapy","armGroupLabels":["traditional rehabilitation program"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cortical activation","description":"Using Near-infrared spectroscopy to measure cortical activation changes weekly for 3 months","timeFrame":"weekly changes within 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"motor function","description":"assess motor function every week for 3 months","timeFrame":"weekly changes within 3 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Activity of daily living function","description":"assess Activity of daily living function weekly for 3 months","timeFrame":"weekly changes within 3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke(unilateral, onset within 7 days, without previous stroke history)\n* Vital sign stable\n* Upper extremity motor function impairment(brunnström stage I\\~III)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* with pacemakers\n* Seizure history\n* Serious dysrhythmias\n* Poor cognition function(MMSE\\<13)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Zheng-Yu Hoe","affiliation":"Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital","city":"Kaohsiung","zip":"81362","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":22.61626,"lon":120.31333}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
