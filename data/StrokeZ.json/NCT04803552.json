This easy and comfortable pre-screening (Sleepiz One) should reduce the barrier for ward physicians to request a sleep study. The method could help to overcome the bottleneck of resource-intense procedures. It is simple to carry out and does not disturb the sleep of the patients.\n\nThe scoring is done according to the AASM Manual Version 2.6. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis will be informed about therapy options by a sleep physician and receive a recommendation for further therapy in the discharge letter from the rehabilitation clinic.\n\nThe goal of the study is then to evaluate if a non-contact method, the Sleepiz One, presents an opportunity for a fast and easy pre-screening during rehabilitation. Therefore, the precision of binary classification of subjects based on their sleep apnea severity (AHI \\>= 15) made by Sleepiz One will be compared to PG data manually scored by expert sleep scorers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Apnea","Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","sleep apnea","contactless","screening"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":67,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Contactless sleep apnea screening vs respiratory polygraphy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Overnight sleep study with Sleepiz One and a respiratory polygraphy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Overnight sleep study with Sleepiz One and a respiratory polygraphy","description":"Participants will undergo a screening night with Sleepiz One. and with a cardiorespiratory polygraphy device (Miniscreen, Heinen-Löwenstein).\n\nMeasurements (Miniscreen, Heinen-Löwenstein)\n\n* Thoracic respiratory effort: respiration frequency (BR), respiration curve\n* Airflow: respiration frequency (BR), respiration curve\n* Body movement: body position\n* Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)\n* Pulse\n\nMeasurements (Sleepiz One):\n\n• Movement originating from breathing and heart contractions","armGroupLabels":["Contactless sleep apnea screening vs respiratory polygraphy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Binary classification of the apnea severity","description":"Precision of binary classification of subjects based on their sleep apnea severity (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \\>= 15) made by Sleepiz One, compared to PG data manually scored by expert sleep scorers","timeFrame":"1 night"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\>18years\n* Ability and consent to undergo electrophysiological routine assessment\n* Informed Consent as documented by signature\n* In-patients of RehaClinic Bad Zurzach\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous enrolment into the current study,\n* Enrolment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees and other dependent persons\n* Cardiac pacemaker or another implanted electrical device\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems, psychological disorders, dementia, delirium etc. of the participant","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jens Acker, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+41 56 269 60 20","email":"j.acker@ksm.ch"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jens Acker, Dr.","affiliation":"KSM Bad Zurzach","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"KSM Bad Zurzach","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Bad Zurzach","state":"Aargau","zip":"5330","country":"Switzerland","contacts":[{"name":"Jens Acker","role":"CONTACT","email":"jens.acker@zurzachcare.ch"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":47.58764,"lon":8.29365}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001049","term":"Apnea"},{"id":"D000012891","term":"Sleep Apnea Syndromes"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000012120","term":"Respiration Disorders"},{"id":"D000012140","term":"Respiratory Tract Diseases"},{"id":"D000012818","term":"Signs and Symptoms, Respiratory"},{"id":"D000020919","term":"Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic"},{"id":"D000020920","term":"Dyssomnias"},{"id":"D000012893","term":"Sleep Wake Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4051","name":"Apnea","asFound":"Apnea","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15384","name":"Sleep Apnea Syndromes","asFound":"Sleep Apnea","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14647","name":"Respiration Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14667","name":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15313","name":"Signs and Symptoms, Respiratory","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21932","name":"Parasomnias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22344","name":"Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22345","name":"Dyssomnias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15386","name":"Sleep Wake Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
