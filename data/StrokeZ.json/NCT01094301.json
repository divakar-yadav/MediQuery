The SPR System is an investigational device that is being studied for the relief of post-stroke shoulder pain. The SPR System uses electrical stimulation and includes a Trial Stage (where a temporary system is used to see if the subject may benefit from this type of therapy) and may include an Implant Stage (where a small device is implanted under the skin in the chest). The SPR System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the shoulder where the subject feels pain. This research study will evaluate the effect of electrical stimulation on shoulder pain.\n\nIndividuals who are over the age of 21, who had a stroke at least six months ago, who experience shoulder pain, and have tried other therapies for their shoulder pain, may be eligible to participate in the first stage of the SPR System. Subjects meeting the specified success criteria at the conclusion of the SPR Trial Stage who experience a return of pain within 6 months of completion of the Trial Stage may be eligible for the second stage (SPR Implant Stage). This research study lasts a little over 3 years and may include 17 visits to the study doctor and at least 8 telephone calls from study staff."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Shoulder Pain"],"keywords":["electrical stimulation","neurostimulation","neuromodulation","shoulder pain","post-stroke shoulder pain","hemiplegic shoulder pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The SPR System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The SPR System is an investigational two-staged device which delivers stimulation to the shoulder.
