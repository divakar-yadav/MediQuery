Assess patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) amongst stroke survivors and their caregivers in the MedStar Health system longitudinally.\n\n   i. Utilize a community advisory board (CAB) of stroke survivors and their caregivers to identify the patient-centered outcome(s) that they determine to be most important and valuable to assess based on their lived experiences.\n\n   ii. Collect the chosen PCOs at multiple time points using an electronic survey tool (e.g. Qualtrics, Tonic or RedCap)\n2. Evaluate the impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) and experiences of discrimination on the chosen PCOs.\n3. Examine whether there are differences in long-term PCOs amongst stroke survivors from different racial and ethnic groups.\n\n2.2 Hypothesis: We hypothesize that stroke survivors that come from historically marginalized populations, specifically African American and Latinos, will have lower patient-centered outcome scores overall as compared to their Caucasian counterparts. In addition, we hypothesize that the difference PCO scores between Caucasian and African American and Latino populations will be due in part to experienced discrimination and not SDoH alone.\n\n."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Survivor","description":"Survivor of acute ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage in the last 6 weeks"},{"label":"Caregiver","description":"Primary caregiver of stroke survivor"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient-Centered Outcome Measures","description":"Assess patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) amongst stroke survivors and their caregivers in the MedStar Health System longitudinally.\n\nStroke Impact Scale and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index","timeFrame":"5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Social Determinants of Health","description":"Evaluate the impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on the chosen PCOs.","timeFrame":"5 years"},{"measure":"Discrimination","description":"Evaluate the impact of patient-reported experiences of discrimination on the chosen PCOs.","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Stroke Survivor:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n≥ 18 years old Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) or Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) patients that have been cared for in the MedStar Healthcare system AIS of ICH in the last six weeks Ability to communicate in English, Spanish, Amharic, Mandarin Chinese or French (most common languages in the greater Washington, DC area)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Unable to complete required forms Life expectancy less than 6 months\n\nCaregiver Inclusion Criteria Age ≥ 18 Self-identify as primary caregiver for the stroke survivor Ability to communicate in English, Spanish, Amharic, Mandarin Chinese, French\n\nExclusion Criteria Unable to complete study survey forms Life expectancy less than 6 months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke Survivors from the MedStar Health System and their Caregivers.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
