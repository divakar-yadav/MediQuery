One treatment involves errorless naming treatment and the other employs verbal plus gestural facilitation of word retrieval. Participants will receive one of the two treatments over several months. Before and after treatment the investigators will administer several tests and conversational samples to examine changes associated with the treatments. The investigators hypothesize that, whereas both treatments will lead to improvements in words rehearsed in therapy, communication outcomes in conversation will be broader for the verbal plus gestural protocol.","detailedDescription":"In this study the investigators are examining the effectiveness of two different speech therapy protocols for word retrieval impairments experienced by individuals with stroke-induced aphasia.
