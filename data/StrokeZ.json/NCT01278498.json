Drug safety, depression and related symptoms will be evaluated and the following 12-week visit will be performed. In the 13th week after the drug administration, the study drug will be reduced to 10mg every other day for one week, and the schedule of drug administration will be completed.\n\nAt the 14th week, all subjects will be instructed not to take the study drug for assessing maintenance effect. At the 24th week, subjects will have follow-up visits to assess poststroke depression and related symptoms.\n\nIf a subject discontinues the study before termination for severe depression, aggressive intervention will be initiated at the 4th week, and the 12-week visit will be performed unless the subject disagrees. If investigators judge the patients have severe depression at the 12-week visit, they should be treated. All the patients who need to treat depression will be followed until 12th week."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression"],"keywords":["Escitalopram","Depression","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":444,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"escitalopram","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"prevention of poststroke depression in patients with acute stroke.","interventionNames":["Drug: Escitalopram"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"prevention of poststroke depression in patients with acute stroke.","interventionNames":["Drug: sugar pill"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Escitalopram","description":"first week:5mg 2nd week\\~12 week:10mg","armGroupLabels":["escitalopram"],"otherNames":["lexacure"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"sugar pill","description":"first week:5mg 2nd week\\~12 weeks:10mg","armGroupLabels":["placebo"],"otherNames":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Occurrence rate of depression","description":"Occurrence rate of depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale score ≥16)","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevention of depression","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Prevention of emotional incontinence","timeFrame":"3, 6 months"},{"measure":"Prevention of anger proneness","timeFrame":"3, 6 months"},{"measure":"Recovery of neurologic dysfunction","timeFrame":"3, 6 months"},{"measure":"Improvement of cognitive function","timeFrame":"3, 6 months"},{"measure":"Improvement of quality of life","timeFrame":"3, 6 months"},{"measure":"Improvement of caregiver burden","timeFrame":"3, 6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults older than 20 years\n* Patients with acute stroke (ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage) confirmed by neuroimaging within 21 days after stroke onset\n* Patients with hemorrhagic transformation of infarcted tissue will not be included, but if investigators judge the risk of bleeding is small (i.e., reduced amount of blood in follow-up neuroimaging) those patients can be enrolled.\n* Patients with MRS ≥ 2 on screening\n* Patients without definite history of depression\n* Patients who fulfill the following criteria in the K-MADRS test:\n\nThe combined score of the 9th question (pessimistic thoughts) and the 10th question (suicidal idea) ≤ 7 The score of the 10th question \\< 6\n\n* Patients without serious communication problem\n* Patients who agree to participate in this trial\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with MRS 0 or 1 on screening\n* Patients who have definite history of depression or have taken antidepressants\n* Patients who have been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder or other psychiatric disorders\n* Patients with severe dementia or aphasia.
