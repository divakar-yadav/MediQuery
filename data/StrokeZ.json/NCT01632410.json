Control consist similar in description healthy subjects, will be examined once. Each test includes 24 hours Holter surveillance and an examine that include general check that reflects the autonomic reaction to different manipulation.\n\nThe examination description:\n\nA. Prior to the examination subjects will be asked to fill the mRS, NIHSS forms.\n\nB. Subjects will receive an examination that includes\n\n* General neurological examination (strength, deep and superficial sensation, cognitive test and pain level.) C. Holter will be place for 24 hours. And autonomic examination test will be conducted\n* Grip Test: emphases the sympathetic system.\n* Breathing Test: emphases the parasympathetic system. D. Manipulation to examine the two sub systems. Each manipulation lasts1 minute."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["autonomic nerve system","post stroke","focus of study: to describe the autonomic nerve system function post stroke","autonomic nervous system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group 1","description":"Post hemispheral ischemic stroke cognitively intact.
