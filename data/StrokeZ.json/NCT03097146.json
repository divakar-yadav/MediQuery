The investigators believe this aftercare could be better coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres. In this study, the investigators postulate that a similar coordinated approach to care can be extended to the phase after in-patient rehabilitation has ended (i.e. \"long-term management\" as opposed to \"early supported discharge\") for disabled patients with stroke living in the community."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Aftercare","Comprehensive Care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"comprehensive multidisciplinary stroke care","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: comprehensive multidisciplinary stroke care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"comprehensive multidisciplinary stroke care","description":"Patients will be treated in the pathological domain.
