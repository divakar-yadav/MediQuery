Different needling techniques, including Botulinum Toxin A are proposed for management of spasticity; however results are conflicting. The presence of spasticity in the upper extremity implies several impairments for daily life activities. No study has investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature of the shoulder region in patients who had suffered a stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the inclusion of deep dry needling into a rehabilitation program over the musculature of the shoulder region, pressure pain hyperalgesia and range of motion in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving dry needling into the spastic shoulder musculature would exhibit greater improvements in spasticity, pressure sensitivity and range of motion than those who will not receive the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["dry needling","spasticity","pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental intervention will consist of 3 sessions, one per week, of 45min of physical therapy including mobilizations of the scapular region, manual therapies targeted to decrease muscle tone, neuromodulatory techniques for spasticity and proprioceptive exercises for the upper extremity.
