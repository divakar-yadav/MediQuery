Subjects: Thirty-three patients post chronic stroke were recruited of the study.\n\nIntervention: Patients who first participated in the MT intervention performed a single session of MT, whereas in the control intervention a single session composed of the same exercises was performed, but without the mirror. After a month washout, the patients switched groups.\n\nMain measure: The primary outcome measure was motor control. The secondary outcome measure was manual dexterity and UE spasticity.\n\nThe data will be expressed as mean and 95% confidence interval (continuous variable) and absolute frequency (categorical variables). To compare the outcomes of the different experimental sessions and at the different moments (pre and post session), the Generalized Estimating Equations with post hoc LSD (Least Significant Difference) methods will be used. For all analysis the significance level was set at α = 0.05 and statistical software SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Mac, version 22.0, IBM, USA) will be used.\n\nKey words: Stroke, mirror therapy, upper extremity, kinematic analysis"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror Therapy Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Mirror Therapy"]},{"label":"Control Intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Control Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mirror Therapy","description":"The healthy UE will be positioned in front of the mirror and the paretic UE behind it, enabling the patient to observe the movements of the healthy limb through the mirror, interpreting that image as the affected limb.
