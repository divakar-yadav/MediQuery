While the most common, such as atherosclerosis are widely studied, others are less well known, such as arterial dissections or cerebral angiopathies. What's more, most studies are limited to a few years' follow-up and the longer-term evolution of patients is less well assessed. Patient follow-up data available in routine practice and specific enrollment through the headache emergencies of the Lariboisière neurovascular intensive care unit (USINV) could provide a particularly rich resource."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients treated for acute cerebrovascular pathology cerebrovascular disease","interventionNames":["Other: follow-up"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"follow-up","description":"Long term follow-up","armGroupLabels":["Patients treated for acute cerebrovascular pathology cerebrovascular disease"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of a vascular event","description":"Vascular event is defined as : myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, recurrence of cerebrovascular disease, systemic embolism, congestive heart disease, vascular or non-vascular death during patient follow-up.","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of a vascular event","description":"Vascular event is defined as : myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, recurrence of cerebrovascular disease, systemic embolism, congestive heart disease, vascular or non-vascular death during patient follow-up.","timeFrame":"Up to 10 years"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin score","description":"The modified Rankin score is a 6 point disability scale varying between 0 to 5.
