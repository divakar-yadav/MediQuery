Research suggests that using an auditory cue, such as a regular beat or pulse, as part of rehabilitation can improve walking. It is also recommended that early rehabilitation following stroke delivers the bestoutcome for patients.\n\nStudy aim:To determine whether the use of auditory cueing in early stroke rehabilitation is feasible during a balance and gait therapy programme.\n\nStudy participants: Adults following acute stroke with walking problems. Participants must be able to sit unsupported and stand with assistance of 1 or 2 people. They will be recruited from the acute stroke unit at North Tyneside General Hospital 2 days to 4 weeks following stroke. A total of 12 participants will be recruited.\n\nStudy setting: Acute stroke unit - North Tyneside General Hospital and participants homes if they are discharged within the study period.\n\nIntervention:Participants will receive auditory rhythmical cueing intervention targeting balance and gait for 30 minutes x5 / week for 3 weeks within the physiotherapy gym on the stroke unit or at home if discharged within the intervention period. The 30 minutes will consist of balance exercises and walking practice using auditory cueing with a metronome.\n\nMeasures:1. What the participants and the therapists think of the intervention will be assessed by questionnaires. The questionnaires contain open and closed questions and have been developed specifically for this study.\n\n2.The stroke survivors trunk control, balance and walking will be assessed before and after the intervention.\n\nStudy Duration: 12 months\n\nFuture Plans: This study will be used to inform a larger study testing if the intervention works and how much it costs"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Weeks","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Auditory rhythmical cueing","description":"Auditory rhythmical cueing intervention targeting balance and gait for 30 minutes x5 per week for 3 weeks."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Participant questionnaire","description":"To seek views of patients on the intervention programme","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Therapist questionnaire","description":"To seek views from therapists on the intervention programme","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulatory category","description":"Functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability - score 0-5","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Trunk Impairment Scale","description":"measures trunk control - Score 0-23","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Trunk ControlTest","description":"To assess motor impairment - Score 0-100","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults (\\> 18 years) following acute stroke (any subtype) with residual mobility problems\n* Within 2 days - 4 weeks post-stroke.\n* Be able to sit unsupported and stand with assistance of 1 or 2 people\n* Able to provide informed consent to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unable to follow the intervention due to cognitive or language impairment.\n* Other medical problems affecting walking and balance (e.g. Parkinson's Disease, severe osteoarthritis and cardiopulmonary conditions).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adults within 2 days to 3 weeks following acute stroke with residual mobility problems.
