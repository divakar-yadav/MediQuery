FINGER is a robot that measures finger movements and allows users to play computer games using those movements.","detailedDescription":"Robotic devices can be used to retrain movement after stroke. However, it is unclear how best to assist in movement. Providing physical assistance may improve the flow of proprioceptive information to the nervous system, which may help a person relearn to move a limb. On the other hand, assisting movement with a robot may cause a person to \"slack\", not trying as hard during therapy. This study will test the effect of different levels of assistance on recovery of finger function during robot-assisted therapy after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FINGER I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects participate in 3 weeks of exercising with the experimental device: FINGER robot with first setting at a minimum of 3 days per week, 1 hour per day with the exercise program","interventionNames":["Device: FINGER I","Device: FINGER II"]},{"label":"FINGER II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects participate in 3 weeks of exercising with the experimental device: FINGER robot with a second setting at a minimum of 3 days per week, 1 hour per day with the exercise program","interventionNames":["Device: FINGER I","Device: FINGER II"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"FINGER I","description":"FINGER is a robot that measures finger movements and allows patients to play computer game using those movements.
