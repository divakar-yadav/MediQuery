The block randomization will be designed so that an even number of patients with left and right sided hemiparesis will have been included in each group at the end of the study.\n\nConventional training (including gait practice) will be performed according to current best practice (approximately 30-60 min per day, 5 days per week) and may include stepping, weight shifting, over ground walking as well as the use of a treadmill with/without body weight support (BWS).\n\nHAL training will be performed 4 days a week for 4 weeks (i.e. 16 sessions) with the single-leg version of HAL, primarily by use of the voluntary HAL-mode (CVC mode), on a treadmill with BWS. The therapist(s) educated in the HAL method will optimize the HAL settings for each individual during each session, in order to obtain a symmetrical gait pattern as close to normal gait as possible.\n\nOutcomes The primary outcome will be changes in the FAC-score during the intervention. FAC assesses activity in terms of independence in walking on a six-grade-ordinal-scale ranging from non-functional walking to independent walking outside. During the intervention assessments with the FAC will be performed weekly by the patients' physiotherapist responsible for conventional rehabilitation. This therapist will otherwise not be involved in the study.\n\nSecondary outcomes include aspects of body functions assessed by use of the NIH Stroke Scale, Albert's test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment(FMA-LE) and the Modified Ashworth Scale for the lower extremities.\n\nActivities and Participation will be assessed by use of Functional Ambulation Categories, 2 minutes walk test in self-preferred speed, Berg Balance Scale, Barthel Index and EQ5D.\n\nPatients' perception of training will be assessed by a study specific questionnaire.\n\nAdverse events (such as irritated skin, pain, falls) will be documented continuously in the study protocol according to a specific study form.\n\nAssessments will be performed 1) before and 2) after the intervention with 3) a follow up at 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ambulation Difficulty","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)"]},{"label":"Conventional gait training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)","description":"Intensive gait training with Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is performed, 1 session/day, 4 days/week during 4 weeks.
