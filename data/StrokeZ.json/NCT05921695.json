The main question it aims to answer is whether limiting the amount of normal saline infusion during emergency department can lower the incidence of acute kidney injury and mortality in patients with heat stroke.\n\nParticipants will receive a free normal saline infusion during the emergency department according to the study design, or a restricted normal saline infusion while using sodium lactate Ringer's instead.\n\nResearchers will compare the normal saline infusion group and sodium lactate Ringer's group to see if limiting the amount of normal saline infusion during emergency department can lower the incidence of acute kidney injury and mortality in patients with heat stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heat Stroke"],"keywords":["heat stroke","normal saline","acute kidney injury","mortality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":190,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normal Saline infusion group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"During the emergency department, the normal saline infusion was not restricted.","interventionNames":["Drug: Normal Saline infusion and Ringer lactate infusion"]},{"label":"Ringer lactate infusion group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Use ringer lactate or other balanced crystallographic solution instead of normal saline.
