The long-term goal of this work is to restore volitional lower limb motor control and gait following stroke. In our prior work, we demonstrated that it was feasible to provide a clinically operated, combined treatment of body weight supported treadmill training alone (BWSTT) + functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) using intramuscular (IM) electrodes (FNS-IM).\n\nSpecific Aims and Hypothesis The purpose or Specific Aim of the study is to test the feasibility and gait training potential of combining the Lokomat and FNS-IM for stroke survivors. Given the feasibility of our clinically operated combination of BWSTT + FNS-IM, we propose to test the feasibility of the combination of Lokomat + FNS-IM.\n\nHypothesis I. It is feasible to utilize a clinically operated combination of Lokomat + functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) with intramuscular (IM) electrodes (FNS-IM).\n\nTreatment Procedures. The subjects will be treated for three months, four sessions/week (for a total of 48 treatment visits). A given session will be 1 hrs, with the time divided into thirds as follows: 1) hr coordination exercise; 2) hr over ground gait training; and 3) hr Lokomat gait training. FNS-IM will be used in all three aspects of the protocol, unless the subject is capable of volitionally executing a given movement or gait component. Population. The subjects will be chronic stroke survivors (\\>6 months after the stroke)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["cerebrovascular accident","electrical stimulation","gait training","motor learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke","interventionNames":["Device: Gait Robot","Device: Functional Neuromuscular stimulation with intramuscular electrodes"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Gait Robot","description":"gait training with the use of a gait robot","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Functional Neuromuscular stimulation with intramuscular electrodes","description":"gait training with use of functional electrical stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Observational Gait Components: Observational Comparison of Gait Components for: Gait Robot-alone Condition, FES-alone Condition, and Combined Gait Robot and FES.","description":"Observational Gait components during stance and swing phase, for pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle for each of the six participants was observed during the following conditions: Gait Robot-alone, FES-alone, and combined Gait Robot and FES.","timeFrame":"visit 48, following treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Greater than or equal to 6 months after stroke\n* 21 years or older\n* Ability to follow 2 step commands\n* Inability to move leg normally\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pacemaker\n* Progressive medical condition (i.e. Parkinsons Disease)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Janis Daly, PhD MS","affiliation":"VA Medical Center, Cleveland","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"VA Medical Center, Cleveland","city":"Cleveland","state":"Ohio","zip":"44106","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.4995,"lon":-81.69541}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"19165689","type":"RESULT","citation":"McCabe JP, Dohring ME, Marsolais EB, Rogers J, Burdsall R, Roenigk K, Pundik S, Daly JJ.
