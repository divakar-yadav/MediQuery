In order to provide a safe and effective TCM treatment plan for patients with dysphagia after stroke, reduce the disability rate after stroke and improve the quality of life of patients.","detailedDescription":"This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. A total of 60 inpatients with post-stroke dysphagia in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University from April 2022 to December 2023 will be selected, and the patients will be assigned to the experimental group and the control group with 30 cases in each group according to the random number table. The control group will be given basic treatment and swallowing rehabilitation therapy, while the experimental group will be given Liu-Zi-Jue Exercise on the basis of the control group. Both groups are going to treat for 4 weeks and follow up for 60 days. Standardized Swallowing Assessment, Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Study, Volume Viscosity Swallow Test, Penetration-aspiration scale, Water Swallow Test, Modified Barthel Index will be used to evaluate the swallowing function and living ability of patients, and to evaluate the clinical effect of Liu-Zi-Jue Exercise training on patients with dysphagia after stroke. Efficacy, clear its treatment advantages, in order to optimize the cost-effective and standardized rehabilitation program for dysphagia during stroke recovery, improve patients' swallowing function, improve their activities of daily living, and minimize the waste of health resources."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["stroke","dysphagia","rehabilitation","Liu-Zi-Jue Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"basic treatment+ swallowing rehabilitation treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Swallowing function training mainly includes indirect training, direct training, and compensatory techniques, once a day for 20 minutes each time.
