However, until now the guideline has recommended the continuation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy in patients who are at risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score, even though they have sinus rhythm following catheter ablation. The aims of this retrospective study is to assess the rate of stroke/SE during follow-up period after AF ablation and identify the independent risk factors for stroke/SE in patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3198,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke group","description":"Patients who experienced stroke or systemic embolic event following catheter ablation for AF."},{"label":"Control group","description":"Patients who did not experienced stroke or systemic embolic event following catheter ablation for AF."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of stroke or systemic embolism after AF ablation","description":"Risk factors for stroke or systemic embolism after AF ablation","timeFrame":"From the time of catheter ablation until the date of the last visit or the date of event.(Retrospective period of up to 20 years)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Study population was extracted from a consortium of registry of AF ablation by three University Hospitals (Korea univ Guro, Korea univ Anam and Seoul National University) from 1998 to 2016.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Korea University Anam Hospital","city":"Seoul","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}},{"facility":"Korea University Guro Hospital","city":"Seoul","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}},{"facility":"Seoul National University Hospital","city":"Seoul","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31502330","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Ahn J, Shin SY, Shim J, Kim YH, Han SJ, Choi EK, Oh S, Shin JY, Choe JC, Park JS, Lee HW, Oh JH, Choi JH, Lee HC, Cha KS, Hong TJ, Lip GYH, Lim HE.
