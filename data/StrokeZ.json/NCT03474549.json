Patients who are ineligible for IV t-PA or who fail IV t-PA therapy are candidates for treatment.\n\nThe objective of the TIGER Study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Tigertriever device in restoring blood flow in the neurovasculature by removing thrombus in patients experiencing ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion (LVO). This study is designed to support substantial equivalence to approved and marketed products such as the Solitaire or Trevo Retriever."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Mechanical thrombectomy,","Brain","Brain clot","Brain infarction","Cerebral ischemia","Neurovascular intervention","Revascularization","Reperfusion","Stent retriever","Tigertriever","Stroke","Rapid Medical"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tigertriever revascularization device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Mechanical thrombectomy with Tigertriever","interventionNames":["Device: Tigertriever revascularization device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Tigertriever revascularization device","description":"Mechanical Thrombectomy","armGroupLabels":["Tigertriever revascularization device"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Successful reperfusion, defined as mTICI Score ≥ 2b","description":"Effectiveness (Successful reperfusion)","timeFrame":"Day 0 (end of procedure)"},{"measure":"All-cause mortality","description":"Safety (All-cause mortality)","timeFrame":"90 days post treatment"},{"measure":"Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) defined as any parenchymal hematoma type 2, remote intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage that is the predominant cause of ≥4 point NIHSS deterioration at 24 hours","description":"Safety (Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)) defined as any parenchymal hematoma type 2, remote intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage that is the predominant cause of ≥4 point NIHSS deterioration at 24 hours.","timeFrame":"24 hours post procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤2","description":"modified Ranking Scale is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.
