Results from the two doctors will be compared to see how similar they are. This research will help us understand if heart ultrasounds can be used to see how well the heart pumps blood and if similar results are obtained from different doctors.\n\nThe doctors will use ultrasound of the heart to measure E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS). EPSS is the distance between two parts of the heart, the mitral valve and the ventricular septum. EPSS is measured in millimeters (mm). EPSS can estimate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as a measure of how well the heart pumps blood."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Volume","Cardiovascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The doctor's doing the ultrasounds will be blinded to each other's measurements and to the patient's past medical history","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy Volunteer","type":"OTHER","description":"Healthy volunteers over the age of 18 who consent to two ultrasounds.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Ultrasound"]},{"label":"ED patient with planned heart echocardiogram","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in emergency department (ED) who have a heart echocardiogram scheduled as part of their routine clinical care","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Ultrasound"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Ultrasound","description":"Participants will have ultrasounds of the heart by two different emergency medicine doctors.","armGroupLabels":["ED patient with planned heart echocardiogram","Healthy Volunteer"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean change in millimeters between E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) measurements of the heart by two physicians","description":"Two physicians will use the same ultrasound device to measure the E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) on the same patients.
