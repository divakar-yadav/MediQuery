In order to achieve accurate risk stratification and effective treatments, developing new diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies is indispensable. Chinese registry of NICE is a national multi-center prospective study aimed to explore the epidemiology, new biomarkers, risk factors and prognostic models.","detailedDescription":"The pathophysiology of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke is a continuous progression. TIA and minor stroke exhibit the common substantial risk factors for early stroke recurrence and epidemiological characteristic. Since TIA and minor stroke may leave impermanent or mild neurological deficit, they are termed as non-disabling ischemic cerebrovascular disease (NICE).\n\nThe results of the China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance (CCDRFS) 2010 showed that the age-standardized prevalence of TIA is 2.27%. Estimated 23.9 million people may have experienced a TIA in China. The TIA knowing-rate is approximately 3.08% in Chinese adults, only 5.02% received treatment and 4.07% received guideline recommended therapy. The Second China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-II) indicated that minor stroke accounted for 42.23% of all the hospitalized patients of ischemic stroke, which is much higher than that showed in CNSR-I (2007-2008). Thus, it is imperative to develop new strategies to improve the diagnosis, risk prediction and appropriate management of NICE.\n\nNICE is an attractive researching area globally. According to the large quantities of NICE patients in China and the low standardized therapeutic rate, the awareness of NICE is largely insufficient. The purpose of the present study is to establish a multi-center national prospective database of NICE, including clinical information and biological samples library and, to further explore the epidemiology, new biomarkers, risk factors, and prognostic models."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transient Ischemic Attack","Minor Stroke"],"keywords":["transient Ischemic Attack","minor
