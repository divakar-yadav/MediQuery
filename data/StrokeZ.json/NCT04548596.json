In this study, the investigators will primarily use the monitor mode of the Transcranial Doppler (TCD, non-invasive FDA approved device) to record cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals from the Middle Cerebral Artery and Internal Carotid Artery. TCD data and intracranial pressure (ICP) data will be collected in the following four scenarios. Each recording is up to 60 minutes in length.\n\nMultimodality high-resolution physiological signals will be collected from brain injured patients: traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, liver failure, and ischemic stroke. This is not a hypothesis-driven study but rather a signal database development project with a goal to collect multimodality brain monitoring data to support development and validation of algorithms that will be useful for future brain monitoring devices. In particular, the collected data will be used to support:\n\nDevelopment and validation of noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) algorithms.\n\nDevelopment and validation of continuous monitoring of neurovascular coupling state for brain injury patients\n\nDevelopment and validation of noninvasive approaches of detecting elevated ICP state.\n\nDevelopment and validation of approaches to determine most likely causes of ICP elevation.\n\nDevelopment and validation of approaches to detect acute cerebral hemodynamic response to various neurovascular procedures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Liver Failure","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":432,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transcranial Doppler","description":"In this study, the investigators will primarily use the monitor mode of the Transcranial Doppler (TCD, non-invasive FDA approved device) to record cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals from the Middle Cerebral Artery and Internal Carotid Artery.
