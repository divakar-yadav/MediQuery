Innovative and interactive technologies, such as Internet-delivered CBT-I (iCBT-T), have therefore been incorporated into CBT-I, which was identified to have similar effects to that of traditional CBT-I.\n\nIn the proposed trial, screened stroke caregivers will be recruited from community centres, rehabilitation centres, and tertiary hospitals in HK. The intervention group will receive CBTI-based EMI through instant messaging applications( e.g., WhatsApp) as personalised and real-time psychological support led by nurses for 12 weeks. The control group will only receive stroke education messages and chat-based psychological support without the CBT-I content. The primary outcomes are Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. Secondary outcomes will include sleep quality, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, caregiver's burden, and quality of life. A post-trial qualitative study will be conducted to understand the participants' experience of and compliance with the EMI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Insomnia","Depressive Symptoms","Caregiver Burnout","Psychological Distress","Mobile Phone Use"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":138,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving CBT-I based EMI messages.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: iCBTI-based EMI"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Receiving stroke education messages."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"iCBTI-based EMI","description":"Including brief iCBT-I for sleep support, stroke care education, and nurse-led real-time chat-based support messages, which were delivered according to participants' preferences (e.g., time and frequency).","armGroupLabels":["Intervention Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI)","description":"An eight-item rating scale that was developed to screen for insomnia disorder based on DSM-5 criteria.
