The purpose of this study is to study the proteomic profile of patients with ischemic brain injury and compare it to control subjects without ischemic brain injury, subjects with other chronic neurologic diseases or systemic vascular diseases, and pre- and post- therapy which may be associated with, or predictive of, therapeutic outcome.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that there is a unique set of proteins expressed in serum and urine in patients with ischemic brain injury that may provide a more complete understanding of ischemic brain injury pathophysiology.\n\nUltimately, this study may provide information of direct relevance to the medical care of a large proportion of patients with ischemic brain injury and other neurologic diseases in the future. And proteomic proteomic profile may provide important information about the roles of specific biomarkers. Perhaps the prevention of ischemic injury related complications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Brain Injury","Stroke","Healthy Individual","Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)","Neurovascular Injury"],"keywords":["Patient Foramen Ovale","PFO","Stroke","Ischemic Brain Injury","Neurovascular Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":750,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical Outcome and Biomarker Outcome"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Case Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
