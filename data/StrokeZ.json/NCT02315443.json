The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of nerinetide in reducing functional dependence, reducing mortality rate, reducing worsening of stroke, improving neurological outcome and improving activities of daily living.\n\nThe leading safety objectives are to determine the effect of administering a target dose of 2.60 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) IV infusion of nerinetide within three hours of symptom onset by paramedics in the field on serious adverse events and 90-day mortality.\n\nThis trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study initiated prehospital in the ambulance. It is being conducted using Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in Canada. Subjects with suspected acute stroke will be identified in the field by trained paramedics using the approved stroke protocol in use by the local EMS system, and further screened for eligibility and approval by an on-call trial physician. The paramedics will administer the study drug. Upon arrival at the emergency department, subjects will receive standard-of-care.\n\nAn Independent Data Monitoring Committee will perform safety reviews of the clinical data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Cerebral Ischemia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemia","Prehospital","NA-1","Modified Rankin Scale","Haemorrhagic stroke","Transient ischemic attack","Nerinetide"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":532,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nerinetide (NA-1)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2.60 mg/kg of nerinetide (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) administered as a single 10 minute IV infusion using an ambulatory infusion pump early after stroke symptom onset.","interventionNames":["Drug: Nerinetide (NA-1)"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo administered as a single 10 minute IV infusion using an ambulatory infusion pump early after stroke symptom onset.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nerinetide (NA-1)","armGroupLabels":["Nerinetide (NA-1)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scale","description":"The percentage of responders, using a sliding dichotomy on the mRS","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS shift analysis","description":"Shift to reduced functional dependence analyzed across the whole distribution of scores on the mRS","timeFrame":"90 Days or the last rating"},{"measure":"Mortality rate","description":"A reduction in mortality as defined by event rate (proportion, expressed as a percentage)","timeFrame":"90 Days"},{"measure":"Worsening of stroke rate","description":"A reduction in proportion of participants with worsening of stroke.
