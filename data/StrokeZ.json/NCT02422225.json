Real experimental groups were divided into three types; Anode-Anode dual stimulation group, Anode-Cathode dual stimulation group, Single stimulation group. 20-minutes session of the stimulation were applied 5 times a weeks for 2 weeks at pharyngeal motor cortex of affected or non-affected site. The patients were evaluated at baseline, immediately and 2 weeks after tDCS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Eldith DC-STIMULATOR group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention:\n\n20-minutes of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) application 5 days a week for 2 weeks (30 applications for each 3 groups: total 90 applications)","interventionNames":["Device: Eldith DC-STIMULATOR"]},{"label":"sham-Eldith DC-STIMULATOR group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention: 20-minutes of sham-tDCS application 5 days a week for 2 weeks (total 30 applications)","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Eldith DC-STIMULATOR"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Eldith DC-STIMULATOR","description":"Transcranical direct current stimulator (Neuroconn GmbH, Ilmenau, Germany) approved by Conformity European as safe treatment device for stroke patients\n\ntDCS intervention\\]\n\n* Intensity: 1.5mA for 20min Device: Neuroconn GmbH, Ilmenau, Germany\n* Stimulation site \\<Experimental group\\>\n\n  * Anode-Anode dual stimulation group Anode: affected pharyngeal motor cortex / Cathode: affected supraorbit Anode: non-affected pharyngeal motor cortex / Cathode: non-affected supraorbit\n  * Anode-Cathode dual stimulation group Anode: affected pharyngeal motor cortex Cathode: non-affected pharyngeal motor cortex\n  * Single stimulation group Anode: affected pharyngeal motor cortex Cathode: non-affected supraorbit \\<Control group\\> Sham stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Eldith DC-STIMULATOR group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham Eldith DC-STIMULATOR","armGroupLabels":["sham-Eldith DC-STIMULATOR group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale(DOSS) from video fluoroscopic swallowing study(VFSS)","timeFrame":"up to 60 sec"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"American Speech-LanguageHearing Association(ASHA)-Norms","description":"Change in swallowing function","timeFrame":"up to 2 weeks after tDCS"},{"measure":"Korean Version of Modified Barthel Index(K-MBI)","description":"Change in activity of daily living","timeFrame":"up to 2 weeks after tDCS"},{"measure":"Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale(DOSS) from video fluoroscopic swallowing","description":"Change in swallowing function","timeFrame":"2 weeks after tDCS"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Subjects who have diagnosed as primary stroke by physician's physical exam or radiologic diagnosis\n* Subjects who have cortical or subcortical brain lesion\n* Subjects who was diagnosed as stroke within 6 months\n* Subjects ages from 18years to 80years old\n* Subjects who have less than 5 points of DOSS score due to swallowing difficulty from CNS injury\n* Subjects who is possible to receive swallowing function intervention 5 days a week\n* Subjects who understand the purpose of the study and acquired the consent of the patient or caregiver\n* Subjects who had no effect from brain stimulation or electrical stimulation therapy\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Subjects who have pre-existing and active major neurological disease\n* Subjects who have pre-existing and active major psychiatric disease, such as major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or dementia\n* Subjects who have brain lesion except cortex or subcortex area\n* Subjects who have any metal component after brain surgery, low threshold to pain, history of seizure\n* Subjects who is estimated as not appropriate for the study by the investigators","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yong-Il Shin, Ph.D.","affiliation":"Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Yangsan","zip":"626-770","country":"Korea, Republic of","contacts":[{"name":"Yong Il Shin, MD.PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82-55-360-2872","phoneExt":"82-55-360-2872","email":"rmshin01@gmail.com"},{"name":"Yong Il Shin, MD.PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":35.34199,"lon":129.03358}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20407308","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Lequerica AH, Kortte K.
