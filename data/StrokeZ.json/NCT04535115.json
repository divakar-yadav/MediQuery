All patients will benefit from the 2 ventilation strategies then a fluid administration, called \" fluid challenge \", will be performed to discriminate the true responders and others. The order of the ventilation strategies will be determined by randomization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid Challenge","Hemodynamic Monitoring"],"keywords":["Tidal Volume Challenge","Lung Recruitment Maneuver","Pulse Pression Varia-tion","Stroke Volume Variation.","Fluid Responsiveness."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Starting LRM (Lung Recruitment Maneuver)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Starting LRM (Lung Recruitment Maneuver)"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Starting VtC (Tidal Volume Challenge)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Starting VtC (Tidal Volume Challenge)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Starting LRM (Lung Recruitment Maneuver)","description":"The LRM is performed first for 30 seconds (an insufflation pressure of 30 cmH2O for 30 seconds is applied).
