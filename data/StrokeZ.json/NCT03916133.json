The investigators will examine the specific vessel distribution of patients with steno-occlusive disease, treated with a surgical extracranial-intracranial bypass and assess the cerebral perfusion during test occlusion upon a neurovascular treatment and in intracranial tumor patients referred for potential pre-operative embolization.\n\nThis study encompasses three scientific objectives:\n\n1. What is the selective contribution of an individual bypass artery to the brain perfusion?\n2. Is a selective intra-arterial angiographic perfusion examination useful in the decision-making of performing pre-operative embolization of intracranial tumors?\n3. What is the usefulness of performing additive 6s PBV images compared to classical 2D angiography and/or clinical neurological evaluation in case of test occlusion in the evaluation of possible mother vessel occlusion in treatment of complex neurovascular diseases?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Intracranial Aneurysm","Intracranial Arterial Diseases","Cerebral Hypoxia","Intracranial Vascular Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":127,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"OTHER","description":"Included patients will undergo angiographic FDCT perfusion imaging.The study will be embedded in the standard procedure of pre-operative diagnostics and angiographic control after EC-IC bypass treatment of steno-occlusive disease and during pre-embolization mapping and embolization procedure.
