Upper limb spasticity can interfere with joint movement and its severity can range from mild to severe. Common causes of spasticity include cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and stroke. This study will assess how safe and effective ABBV-950 is in treating upper limb spasticity in adult post-stroke participants. Adverse events and change in symptoms will be assessed.\n\nABBV-950 in an investigational drug being developed for treating spasticity. This study is conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, participants are assigned to receive different doses of ABBV-950 or placebo. There is 1 in 4 chance that participants will be assigned to receive placebo. In Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned to receive BOTOX, ABBV-950, or placebo. There is 1 in 5 chance for participants to receive placebo. Approximately 297 adult post-stroke participants with upper limb spasticity will be enrolled at approximately 50 sites in the United States.\n\nIn Part 1, participants will receive intramuscular (IM) injections of ABBV-950 or placebo on Day 1. In Part 2, participants will receive IM injections of BOTOX, ABBV-950, or placebo on Day 1. All participants will be followed for 24 weeks.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to the standard of care. Participants will attend regular clinic visits during the study. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Limb Spasticity"],"keywords":["Spasticity","Upper Limb Spasticity","Stroke","ABBV-950","Botulinum toxin type A"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":297,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Part 1: ABBV-950 Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-Dose A on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 1: Placebo for ABBV-950 Dose A","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo for ABBV-950 on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo for ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 1: ABBV-950 Dose B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-950 Dose B on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 1: Placebo for ABBV-950 Dose B","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo for ABBV-950 on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo for ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 1: ABBV-950 Dose C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-950 Dose C on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 1: Placebo for ABBV-950 Dose C","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo for ABBV-950 on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo for ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 2: BOTOX Dose A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive BOTOX Dose A on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: BOTOX"]},{"label":"Part 2: ABBV-950 Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-950 Dose A on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 2: ABBV-950 Dose B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-950 Dose B on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 2: ABBV-950 Dose C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-950 Dose C on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Biological: ABBV-950"]},{"label":"Part 2: Placebo for ABBV-950","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo for ABBV-950 on Day 1.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo for ABBV-950"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"ABBV-950","description":"Intramuscular (IM) Injection","armGroupLabels":["Part 1: ABBV-950 Dose A","Part 1: ABBV-950 Dose B","Part 1: ABBV-950 Dose C","Part 2: ABBV-950 Dose A","Part 2: ABBV-950 Dose B","Part 2: ABBV-950 Dose C"],"otherNames":["Botulinum toxin type A"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"BOTOX","description":"Intramuscular (IM) Injection","armGroupLabels":["Part 2: BOTOX Dose A"],"otherNames":["OnabotulinumtoxinA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo for ABBV-950","description":"Intramuscular (IM) Injection","armGroupLabels":["Part 1: Placebo for ABBV-950 Dose A","Part 1: Placebo for ABBV-950 Dose B","Part 1: Placebo for ABBV-950 Dose C","Part 2: Placebo for ABBV-950"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Wrist Modified Ashworth Scale-Bohannon (MAS-B)","description":"MAS-B measures muscle tone based on grading the resistance encountered in a specific muscle group by means of passively moving a limb through its range of motion at a study-specified velocity.
