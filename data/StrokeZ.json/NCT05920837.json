Investigating the relationship between the functions of the upper extremity muscles and viscoelastic properties is important in understanding the rehabilitation of individuals with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Upper extremity functions of individuals will be measured and correlated with viscoelastic properties of upper extremity muscles. The box and block test will be used for the function test. The viscoelastic properties of the muscles will be measured with the myotonPRO device. Deltoideus, Triceps, Biceps, Brachioradialis and Extansor digitorum longus were evaluated with myotonPRO. The tonus, stiffness and elasticity of muscles were recorded. Assessments will applied bilaterally and average recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stiffness of Right Hand, Not Elsewhere Classified","Muscle Tone Abnormalities","Functional; Bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"Sample of stroke patients","interventionNames":["Device: MyotonPRO","Other: Box and Block Test"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MyotonPRO","description":"Muscles' viscoelastic properties assess with myotonPRO.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke"],"otherNames":["Viscoelastic properties"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Box and Block Test","description":"Upper extremity's functionality assess with Box and Block Test.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke"],"otherNames":["Functionality Test"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stiffness","description":"stiffness (N/m) is a biomechanical feature of the muscle that characterizes its resistance to a contraction or an external force.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of one month"},{"measure":"Elasticity","description":"The elasticity is measured as a logarithmic decrement (log) of the natural oscillations in the tissue.

The BBT consists of displacing a maximum number of small blocks, one-by-one, from the compartment located on the tested side to the other using the same hand (taking care to pass over the separation).
