It can affect sensory and motor functions which are closely entangled. Among them, upper limb function is often strongly impaired. In this study the investigators are interested in the eventuality to improve motor recovery by the mean of stimulating the proprioception.\n\nProprioception can be stimulated by tendinous vibrations in order to act on the neuromuscular system through the vibratory tonic reflex and by movement illusion.\n\nStimulation by tendinous vibrations, applied to the musculotendinous endings, has been already proposed in post stroke rehabilitation, but only at late stages.\n\nThus the aim of our study is to observe the effects of repeated tendon vibrations, applied in the early post stroke phase, the effect being measured on the excitability of the motor cortex by the Motor Evoked Potentials and on the motor recovery (motor control and activities).\n\nPatients: 30 patients recruited after a first ever stroke whatever the cause and the site; age \\>18; stroke delay\\< 60 days; the maximum duration of participation for each patient is 3 months.\n\nProtocol:\n\nThis rehabilitation protocol will be added to the usual rehabilitation program during inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nParticipants are randomized into two groups: experimental group and placebo group.\n\nThe experimental group benefits from upper limb tendon vibration sessions produced by small electromechanical vibrators on the elbow and the wrist. Frequency of the vibration is 80 Hz, two 15-minutes sessions per day scheduled for 10 days over a period of two weeks (2 x 5 days). During the sessions, the participant wearing opaque glasses, in a seating position, is asked to move if possible his/her arm in the opposite direction of the perceived movement.\n\nThe placebo group receives apparently the same treatment but with \"sham\" vibration.\n\nAssessment:\n\nMotor recovery will be assessed:\n\n* At the brain level by the efficiency of the primary motor pathway, measured by Motor Evoked Potentials recorded at the contralateral hand (main outcome criteria after 30 days from inclusion).\n* At the limb level by the motor control effectiveness measured by the Fugl Meyer scale, the Tardieu scale, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), the Box and Blocks Test (BBT) and the range of upper limb exploration with the ArmeoSpring, Hocoma brand.\n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n\n* To assess any impact on nerve fibers density on the main motor pathway by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\n* To test the feasibility of such a rehabilitation protocol in a Physical Rehabilitation Medicine department\n\nFour consultations are planned:\n\nD0 (day 0): (before starting stimulation): Motor skills assessments, Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nD15 (day 15): (as soon as stimulation ends): Motor skills assessments. D30 (day 30): Motor skills assessments and Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) D90 (day 90): Motor skills assessments, Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke/Brain Attack","Upper Extremity Paresis"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","proprioception"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"pilot, prospective, biomedical, randomized, controlled study with intent-to-treat analysis of a stroke subjects cohort","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group (EG)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An Experimental Group (EG) of post-stroke subjects having vibration stimulation sessions in addition to traditional rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Upper limb repeated multi-site tendon vibrations"]},{"label":"Control Group (CG)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"A Control Group (WG) of post-stroke subjects having placebo/sham vibration sessions (same vibrators used but without the eccentric mass), in addition to traditional rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Upper limb repeated multi-site tendon vibrations"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Upper limb repeated multi-site tendon vibrations","description":"Upper limb tendon vibration protocol will be added to the usual rehabilitation protocol performed during hospitalization","armGroupLabels":["Control Group (CG)","Experimental group (EG)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor recovery assessment at the brain level by the efficiency of the primary motor pathway measured by Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) recorded at the contralateral hand","description":"Assessment of Motor recovery at the brain level by the efficiency of the primary motor pathway, measured by Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) recorded at the contralateral hand:\n\nMagnetic stimulation is provided on the motor cortex involved by the stroke.
