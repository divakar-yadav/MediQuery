Thus, continuous examination of effective treatment interventions for lower extremity functions after stroke is a necessity. Localized muscle vibration (LMV) is one of the treatment interventions that incorporate sensory stimulation to improve motor cortical excitability. This study aimed to investigate the influences of 10-minutes lower extremity LMV application along with conventional physical therapy (CPT) on activities of daily living (ADL) and motor recovery on the hemiparetic lower extremity post-stroke.\n\nMethods: A sample of 37 patients with stroke (8 females) was randomly allocated to either conventional physical therapy (CPT) control group (n=18) or conventional physical therapy and localized muscle vibration (CPT+LMV) experimental group (n=19). All patients received 3 sessions per week of CPT for 8 weeks. The CPT+LMV experimental group received 10-minute LMV at the end of each CPT session. The outcome measures used were the Barthel Index (BI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and goniometry for Range of Motion (ROM) assessment.","detailedDescription":"All patients in both experimental and control groups received CPT protocol consisted of 30 minutes of manual resistance exercise (3 sets/10 repetitions each for knee extensors and flexors) and 30 minutes of treadmill training, short breaks (1-5 minutes) were allowed, depending on the patient tolerance. The training was conducted for 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The patients in CPT+LMV experimental group received localized muscle vibration at the end of each CPT session. The LMV was applied for 10 minutes perpendicularly along quadriceps muscle fibers. The frequency set at 30 Hz, amplitude of 2 mm."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional physical therapy intervention plus localized muscle vibration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"physical therapy intervention plus localized muscle vibration","interventionNames":["Device: Localized muscle vibration","Other: Conventional physiotherapy intervention"]},{"label":"Conventional physical therapy intervention","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"physical therapy intervention","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physiotherapy intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Localized muscle vibration","description":"All patients in both experimental and control groups received CPT protocol consisted of 30 minutes of manual resistance exercise (3 sets/10 repetitions each for knee extensors and flexors) and 30 minutes of treadmill training, short breaks (1-5 minutes) were allowed, depending on the patient tolerance.

Measure of functional disability. The BI consisting of 10 common activities of daily living (ADL) activities, administered through direct observation. These are assessed for independence/ dependence and scored via an arbitrary weighting system (originally applied to reflect nursing care and social acceptability). Eight of the ten items represent activities related to personal care; the remaining 2 are related to mobility.

This scale consists of 14 items requiring patients to maintain their positions or complete tasks of varying levels of difficulty. All items are related to everyday life tasks. A score of zero represents an inability of the patient to complete the task and a score of 4 represents the ability of the patient to complete the task independently. The total scores range from 0 - 56. A total score of less than 45 indicates a balance impairment.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline balance at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Goniometry","description":"Range of motion assessed by goniometry; is the measurement of angles, particularly those formed by joints.
