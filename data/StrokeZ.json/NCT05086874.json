The researchers plan to include 10,000 cases of ischemic stroke patients using butylphthalide and 10,000 cases of ischemic stroke patients using Urinary Kallidinogenase. The main purpose is to analyze the effectiveness and safety of butylphthalide and establish the drug risk assessment management plan.","detailedDescription":"Ischemic stroke is a type of syndrome in which blood supply to the brain is impaired due to various reasons, leading to local brain tissue ischemia, hypoxic necrosis, and corresponding neurological deficits. It has a high incidence, high morbidity and disability. Features of high recurrence rate.\n\nButylphthalide can improve the damage of central nervous system in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and can promote the improvement of patients with neurological deficits. Regarding butylphthalide in the treatment of ischemic stroke, there is still a lack of big data research based on the efficacy and safety of the real world.\n\nTherefore, it is planned to include 10,000 patients who used butylphthalide or Urinary Kallidinogenase in five hospitals from 2019 to 2021, and record the basic information of the patients, medication status and related test results. The data was cleaned, sorted and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of butylphthalide in the treatment of ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Nervous System Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"],"keywords":["butylphthalide","Ischemic Strokes","Real world research"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exposed group","description":"A group of patients with ischemic stroke, treated with butylphthalide","interventionNames":["Other: butylphthalide"]},{"label":"Non-exposed group","description":"A group of patients with ischemic stroke, treated with Urinary Kallidinogenase"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"butylphthalide","description":"Observational only and no predesigned interventions in this study","armGroupLabels":["Exposed group"],"otherNames":["observational only ,no intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of adverse events","description":"The probability of unanticipated and adverse medical events after the patient receives medication, but it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment","timeFrame":"90days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS","description":"NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) to assess the degree of neurological deficit in stroke patients.
