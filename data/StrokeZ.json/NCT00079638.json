Statins are a class of medication that is often prescribed to patients who need to lower their cholesterol levels.","detailedDescription":"Name of Drugs: Niaspan (niacin extended-release tablets), Lipitor® (atorvastatin), Zocor® (simvastatin), Zetia™ (ezetimibe), and Crestor® (rosuvastatin)\n\nStudy Treatment: Four open-label parallel treatment groups for 12 weeks of observation\n\n* Niaspan and atorvastatin combination treatment titrated to 2000 mg and 40 mg, respectively;\n* combination treatment of simvastatin titrated to 40 mg and ezetimibe maintained at 10 mg;\n* rosuvastatin monotherapy treatment titrated to 40 mg; and\n* Niaspan and rosuvastatin combination treatment titrated to 1000 mg and 20 mg, respectively.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the relative efficacy of first-line therapy using the combination of Niaspan and atorvastatin versus the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe versus rosuvastatin monotherapy versus the combination of Niaspan and rosuvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia.\n\nPopulation:\n\n* Male or female patients 21 years of age or older\n* Patients who are eligible for treatment based upon National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) recommendations at the end of the Qualification period;\n* All patients must have mean triglycerides (TG) ≤ 300 mg/dL.\n\nDesign: A Phase IV, 12-week, randomized, multi-center, open-label, four-arm, parallel-group study evaluating the efficacy of Niaspan and statin therapy versus other lipid-modifying therapies preceded by a four-week washout of any previous lipid-lowering therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dyslipidemia","Coronary Heart Disease","Atherosclerosis","Stroke","Diabetes"],"keywords":["Niaspan","Niacin","Statin","Cholesterol","Triglycerides","Lipid-Modifying Therapies","Dyslipidemia","Coronary Heart Disease","Atherosclerosis","Stroke","VA-HIT","Niacin Statin Combination Threrapy","High Density Lipoprotein","Low Density Lipoprotein","Hypertension","Diabetes","Adult Treatment Panel III"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Niacin"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atorvastatin"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Simvastatin"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ezetimibe"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rosuvastatin"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean percent change in LDL-C from Baseline to Week 12"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAll of the following criteria must be answered \"Yes\":\n\n1.
