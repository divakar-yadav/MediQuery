About four stroke events occur per day in Luxembourg alone, and about 30% of these patients are affected by recurrent stroke within the following five years. Thus, new methods of primary and secondary prevention are needed to better control lifestyle-related risk factors.\n\nThe development and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle (smoking cessation, healthy nutrition, moderate physical exercises etc.) is a major objective concerning the primary and secondary prevention of cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases. CAPSYS is a computer-based lifestyle coaching system developed by researchers from the Public Research Centre (CRP) Henri Tudor in Luxembourg in collaboration with neurologists from the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL), which aims at supporting patients in performing appropriate behavior changes in order to minimize their individual risk factors. Patients can access CAPSYS by dialing a local-rate telephone number and answer to a set of previously known questions concerning their current nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure, smoking etc. In an interactive voice response approach, questions are issued by the system in natural language using text-to-speech, and the patient can provide the required values using the phone keypad. Based on the gathered values for each patient, the system automatically generates personalized verbal feedback at runtime and presents it to the patient during the phone dialog. Depending on the individual development of the patient's risk factors, the system feedback can contain advice for improvement, praise for healthy behavior and motivation to pursue a certain goal.\n\nThe user acceptance and effectiveness of the CAPSYS system is evaluated in a six-month randomized controlled study with participants recruited at CHL's neurology department."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Diseases","Stroke","Cardiovascular Diseases","CVD Risk Factors"],"keywords":["Lifestyle coaching","Phone-based system","CVD prevention","Patient-centered decision support"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":94,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard care (SC)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Standard care"]},{"label":"Interventional care (IC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: CAPSYS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Standard care","description":"Participants receive only the usual care including blood analyses, blood pressure controls and individual advice on healthy lifestyle during the outpatient treatment given by the neurologist, by the general practitioner and by other physicians.","armGroupLabels":["Standard care (SC)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"CAPSYS","description":"In addition to the usual care, patients are asked to call the CAPSYS system twice a week.","armGroupLabels":["Interventional care (IC)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Systolic Blood Pressure","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in HDL Level","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in LDL Level","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Triglyceride Level","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in HbA1c Level","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Glycaemia Level","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in BMI Value","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fruits and Vegetables Consumption","description":"Self-reported weekly portions of fruits and vegetables consumption\n\n(During the recruiting interview, participants were instructed in estimating the size of a portion of fruits or vegetables and they were provided an information booklet on this topic.)","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Whole Grain Food Consumption","description":"Self-reported weekly portions of whole grain food consumption\n\n(During the recruiting interview, participants were instructed in estimating the size of a portion of whole grain food and they were provided an information booklet on this topic.)","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Sweets Consumption","description":"Self-reported weekly portions of sweets consumption\n\n(During the recruiting interview, participants were instructed in estimating the size of a portion of sweets and they were provided an information booklet on this topic.)","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Duration of Physical Activity","description":"Self-reported weekly duration of physical activity of medium or high intensity","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Quality of Life","description":"The QoL was measured using the standardised EQ-5D-5L instrument provided by the EuroQol Group.\n\nIn this context, the health value was specified by the participants on a subjective scale ranging from 0 (\"The worst health you can imagine\") to 100 (\"The best health you can imagine\").","timeFrame":"baseline and 6 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Usability: SUS Score","description":"The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (SUS).\n\nSUS scores were not collected in the SC group because the SC participants were not using CAPSYS and hence were not able to assess its usability.\n\nThe System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a \"quick and dirty\", reliable tool for measuring the usability.
