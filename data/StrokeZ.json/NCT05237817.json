However, part of AIs in patients is associated with Stroke . The investigators aimed to investigate the risk for disability and death in the large group of stroke patients with AIs.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo measure the association between stroke and levels of autonomous cortisol secretion in patients with AIs.\n\nDesign:\n\nPart 1, Retrospective cohort study.\n\nFrom April 1, 2021, to September 30, 2021, cohort patients with stroke were recruited in this study. The investigators assess the standardised incidence rate of AIs in all patients. Meanwhile, detail information about stroke disease、patient and AIs characteristics were record.\n\nPart 2, Prospective cohort study.\n\nFrom Mar 1, 2022, to Feb 29, 2024, cohort patients with stroke plane to recruit in this study. All patient receive the plasma cortisol level after a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test. The investigators assess the standardised incidence rate of AIs in all patients.
