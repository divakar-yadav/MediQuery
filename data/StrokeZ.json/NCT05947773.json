The treatment is started in a subacute state and completed in the hospital. The essence of robot-assisted treatments is faster recovery and better learning to walk. The group will do a special walking exercise with a robot. The walking group does the same training, only without robotic assistance. The control group will receive physiotherapy treatments financed by the state.
