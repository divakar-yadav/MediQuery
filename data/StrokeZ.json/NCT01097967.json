The long-term effect (6-24-month) of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) on clinical vascular outcome, cardiovascular parameters, evolution of surrogate of atherosclerosis heart rate variability and endothelial function after ACE is observed over 24 months. A preventive effect of CPAP therapy on cerebro-vascular events in patients with moderate-severe obstructive SDB without sleepiness after ictus or transient ischaemic attack will be evaluated.","detailedDescription":"Sleep disordered breathing is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is frequent in patients with acute cerebrovascular events. In this study the investigators observe the association between sleep disordered breathing, hypertension, stroke and the evolution of blood markers for atherosclerosis as well as the efficacy of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment in patients with acute or subacute cerebrovascular events.\n\nSleep disordered breathing is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is frequent in patients with acute cerebrovascular events. In this study the investigators observe the association between sleep disordered breathing, hypertension, stroke and the evolution of blood markers for atherosclerosis as well as the efficacy of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment in patients with acute or subacute cerebrovascular events.\n\nThe SAS CARE 1 study is planned to verify whether or not sleep disordered breathing has a detrimental 3 months effect on cardiovascular functions and markers after acute cerebrovascular events. The SAS CARE 2 study is designed to address whether or not the treatment of sleep disordered breathing with CPAP reduces the combined rate of mortality, stroke, cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction/revascularisation/instable angina/ hospitalisation for heart insufficiency) over a 24 months period in patients after acute cerebrovascular events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["TIA","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Sleep disordered breathing","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","Sleep apnoea","Markers of atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":246,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CPAP in sleepy patients with SDB","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"SDB defined as AHI \\>=20 Sleepy defined as Epworth Sleepiness Score \\>=10","interventionNames":["Other: CPAP"]},{"label":"no CPAP in non sleepy patients with SDB","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"SDB defined as AHI \\>=20 Sleepy defined as Epworth Sleepiness Score \\>=10"},{"label":"CPAP in non sleepy patients with SDB","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"SDB defined as AHI \\>=20 Sleepy defined as Epworth Sleepiness Score \\>=10","interventionNames":["Other: CPAP"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"CPAP","armGroupLabels":["CPAP in non sleepy patients with SDB","CPAP in sleepy patients with SDB"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Occurence of new vascular events or death in stroke survivors (myocardial infarction, stroke, death) assessed by telephone or reported","description":"New vascular events will be assessed by regular telephone interviews at 6,12 and 24 months after stroke","timeFrame":"24 monts after stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"CPAP-Compliance measured by hours of usage","description":"Compliance is monitored for the use of the CPAP by the pulmonary specialist at the patients' routine visits 2-3, 4-6 weeks, 3-6 months, 12 and 24 months after randomisation.
