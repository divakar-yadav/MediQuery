Imaging evaluation of hemodynamic status and antegrade flow were assessed. Patients were followed up to record radiological and clinical outcome. The study recruited patients from 11 centers located in 10 provinces or province-level municipalities across the northeast to the southeast of China mainland.","detailedDescription":"Patients:\n\nPatients with cerebral ischemia sympton of onset in 24 hours were included. Baseline materials, NIH stroke scale score, modified Rankin Scale at admission, stroke causes, time from sympton onset to enrollment were recorded.\n\nImaging scan were conducted at admission, within 7 days after admission.\n\nImaging protocols:\n\nMRI scan protocols: T2 weighted image, T1 weighted image, Diffusion weighted image(DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR), Perfusion weighted image(PWI), arterial spin labeling(ASL) , susceptibility-weighted imaging(SWI).\n\nContrast agent:\n\nOmniscan 2ml/kg, Inject rate：3ml/s\n\nDigital subtraction angiography(DSA) protocols:\n\nSelective angiography and imaging phase from arterial phase to late venous phase.\n\nImaging evaluation:\n\nAntegrade flow assessment from ASL Cerebral blood flow(CBF) map. Collateral flow assessment from ASL CBF map, ASL subtraction CBF map, PWI postprocessing map, FLAIR hyperintensity vascular sign.\n\nInitial infarct volume measurement form DWI. Final infarct volume measurement from FLAIR. DWI-ASPECTS. Stroke lesions pattern assessment identified on DWI. DSA antegrade and collateral grade using modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction(TICI) scale and The American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (ASITN) collateral grading system.\n\nTreatment:\n\nIntravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA), endovascular therapy and conventional treatment including neuro protection, ante-platelet and statin.\n\nFollow up:\n\nwithin Seven days and a month after imaging follow up and clinical stroke event and modified Rankin Scale(mRS) record in 1 year.\n\nNote:\n\nThe original trial from 2015 to 2018 recruited patients with acute and subacute ischemic stroke, and the trial plan was changed to recruit patients with acute cerebral ischemia sympton of onset within 24 h.The study has been upgraded from a single-center study to a multi-center study since 2018."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Arterial Spin Labeling","Ischemic stroke","Collateral Circulation","Perfusion imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":961,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke","description":"Ischemic stroke patients with sympton onset in 24 hours and no contradiction to MRI scan","interventionNames":["Other: MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"MRI","description":"MRI perfusion imaging, including contrast bolus perfusion imaging and arterial spin labeling.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Score","description":"Modified Rankin Score of patients with acute stroke after 3 months will be followed up for neurological outcome assessment. mRS \\< 2 is defined as favorable","timeFrame":"Three months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Final infarct volume","description":"Final infarct volume will be measured and infarct volume growth will be calculated.","timeFrame":"Seven days to 1 month"},{"measure":"Stroke event","description":"The patients will be monitored whether they recured ischemic stroke event including transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke confirmed by neurologist and diffusion-weighted image MRI.","timeFrame":"within 1 year"},{"measure":"mortality","description":"The patient will be monitored for death by telephone follow-up for neurological outcome assessment","timeFrame":"within 1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age≥18\n* Cerebral ischemic sympton with onset in 24 hours\n* pre mRS\\<2\n* All MR examination performed according to study protocol\n* Signed informed consent obtained from the patient or patient's legally authorized representative\n* Having complete medical history and clinical follow up\n* Imaging data can be processed\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Intracranial hemorrhage\n* Pregnancy and other contraindication to MRI scan\n* Informed consent not obtained\n* Pre-existing medical, neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological, functional, or imaging evaluations\n* Known allergy to iodine previously refractory to pretreatment medications\n* Renal Failure (serum creatinine \\> 2.0 or Glomerular Filtration Rate \\[GFR\\] \\< 30)\n* History of sever kidney disease as an adult, including tumor or transplant surgery, or family history of kidney failure\n* Severe cardiac insufficiency","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Ischemic stroke patients with sympton onset in 24 hours","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Xin Lou, M.D.,Ph.D.","affiliation":"Chinese PLA General Hospital","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chinese PLA General Hospital","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100853","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35877061","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Lyu J, Xiao S, Meng Z, Wu X, Chen W, Wang G, Niu Q, Li X, Bian Y, Han D, Guo W, Yang S, Bian X, Duan Q, Lan Y, Wang L, Zhang T, Duan C, Chen L, Tian C, Pan Y, Zhou X, Lou X; MR-STARS Investigators.
