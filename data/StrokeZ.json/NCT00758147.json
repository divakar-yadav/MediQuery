Regaining function requires learning through repetitive movements and activities of daily living(ADLs).\n\nThe aim of the study in this application is to test the usability of the system in specialized rehabilitation hospital settings. In this first stage of development, after developing and testing the system together with expert physiotherapists, we will examine the system for usability (is it \"user friendly\"), comfort level, and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nThe system consists of an ordinary PC computer, specially written software, and a commercially available force feedback joystick. (Force feedback joysticks, are usually used for gaming; they contain miniature motors that allow the joystick to either help or resist the movements of the person using it). Patients who are unable to grasp the joystick will use a specially built arm rest that is attached to an ordinary office chair without wheels. Patients rest their forearm on the arm rest and thus can manipulate the joystick by means of movement of the shoulder and elbow joints instead of by movements of the wrist, since wrist movements are often difficult for brain damaged individuals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["force feedback joystick","stroke","haptics","kinematics","rehabilitation","robotics","Force feedback joystick in stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Exercise with force feedback joystick","description":"System consists of a commercially available force feedback joystick, and specially written software.
