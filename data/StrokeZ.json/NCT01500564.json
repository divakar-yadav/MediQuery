However these improvements are usually short-lived, lasting less than one hour before the patient's performance returns to baseline. In these studies, tDCS is typically applied with the goal of adaptively enhancing functional activation of pathologically under-active tissue or suppressing pathologically over-active tissue. Interestingly, a small body of evidence is now emerging to indicate that tDCS can improve learning/memory functions in healthy controls. The goal of this study is to test if the application of tDCS could enhance learning and/or memory for physiotherapy rehabilitation, which may in turn lead to correspondingly greater motor improvement. Patients at a subacute stage (1 to 6 month post stroke) will attend for 10 consecutive daily sessions of tDCS.\n\nThis research has important implications; previous studies suggest that such an approach has the potential to facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke and establish tDCS as a clinically viable rehabilitative tool. Recovery of motor skills may take many months to acquire and therefore strategies that have the potential to enhance acquisition of skill are of practical and scientific interest."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sham tDCS and motor training: sham comparator","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive sham tDCS over the primary motor cortex of the ipsilesional hemisphere during 20 minutes of motor training (10 consecutive sessions Monday-Friday during two weeks).\n\nIntervention: placebo tDCS Other: Motor Training","interventionNames":["Device: Sham tDCS"]},{"label":"Anodal tDCS and motor training: experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex of the ipsilesional hemisphere.
