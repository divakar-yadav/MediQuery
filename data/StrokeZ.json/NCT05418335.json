Restricting the activities of daily living of stroke patients impairs patients' ability to pay attention to oral hygiene. Facial paresis and tongue weakness due to stroke may cause a decrease in the control of dental prostheses and the removal of food residues in the oral cavity. Food residues and saliva contaminated with bacteria as a result of poor oral hygiene can result in pneumonia when aspirated due to oropharyngeal dysphagia. In the literature, it has been shown that there are significant relationships between periodontal health and vitamin D and calcium intake, and that dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D can improve periodontal health, increase bone mineral density in the mandible, and inhibit alveolar bone resorption. In line with all these data, our hypothesis in this study is to investigate the relationship between oral health and vitamin D levels in stroke patients in rehabilitation units.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a common, serious and restrictive global health problem. In most countries, stroke is among the second or third most common cause of death and is one of the main causes of acquired disability in adults. Although the first attack is usually not fatal in stroke patients, it can often have long-term consequences for patients and their families. Although notable advances have been made in the medical management of stroke, treatment for most stroke patients is based on care and rehabilitation. Motor, perceptual, and cognitive impairments after stroke can have adverse effects on daily functions, reducing health-related quality of life. Restricting the activities of daily living of stroke patients impairs patients' ability to pay attention to oral hygiene. Facial paresis and tongue weakness due to stroke may cause a decrease in the control of dental prostheses and the removal of food residues in the oral cavity. Food residues and saliva contaminated with bacteria as a result of poor oral hygiene can result in pneumonia when aspirated due to oropharyngeal dysphagia.In addition, reduced tongue pressure fails to push the food bolus into the pharynx. Decreased lip strength causes saliva to flow during chewing. Hyposalivation causes a lack of lubrication in the oral mucosa. Abnormal oral sensory function, rapid and improper swallowing of food causes choking and aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia. Incompatible orofacial function leads to low chewing efficiency, limited food selection, and malnutrition. In addition, the risk of poor periodontal health is associated with stroke recurrence and more severe stroke. Third, severe periodontitis, which leads to decreased bite force and increased tooth mobility during chewing, impairs chewing and food intake, affecting oral health conditions.Vitamin D plays a critical role in mediating calcium absorption and regulating musculoskeletal health.There are reports of the benefit of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in the treatment of periodontal disease. Some previous studies reported that calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduced tooth loss and alveolar bone resorption, but could not reach a clear conclusion because of the heterogeneous composition of the study groups or because it did not directly measure periodontal disease status. More recent studies have shown that there are significant associations between periodontal health and the intake of vitamin D and calcium, and that dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D can improve periodontal health, increase bone mineral density in the mandible, and inhibit alveolar bone resorption. In line with all these data, our hypothesis in this study is to investigate the relationship between oral health and vitamin D levels in stroke patients in rehabilitation units."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Oral Disease","D Vitamin Deficiency"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke group","description":"stroke history at least 3 months ago","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical examination, functional status evaluation"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"Healthy control","interventionNames":["Other: Clinical examination, functional status evaluation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Clinical examination, functional status evaluation","description":"Barthel Index, Oral Health Impact Profile 14, Beck Depression Inventory, Stroke Impact Scale 3, Plaque Index, Calculus Index, Periodontal Disease Index, Simplified Oral Hygiene Index assesment, DMFT Index","armGroupLabels":["Control group","stroke group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Barthel Index","description":"It is a simple, understandable index that includes all the parameters of daily living activities.
