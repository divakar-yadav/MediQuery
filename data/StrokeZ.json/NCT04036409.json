Besides being a highly prevalent condition, it is also a risk factor for several major cardiovascular events including stroke (which consists of the second leading cause of death in developing countries) and coronary artery disease, and is also related to cognitive decline. The OPTIMAL Stroke trial consists of a two-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a lower target systolic blood pressure (SBP) as compared to the currently recommended target for stroke patients will reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Blood Pressure","Cognitive Impairment","Vascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4369,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intensive Control of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized into the Intensive Blood Pressure arm will have a goal of SBP \\<120 mm Hg.","interventionNames":["Drug: Intensive Control of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)"]},{"label":"Standard Control of Systolic Blood Pressure","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants randomized into the Standard arm will have a goal of SBP \\<140 mm Hg","interventionNames":["Drug: Standard control of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Intensive Control of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)","description":"Participants in the Intensive arm have a goal of SBP \\<120 mm Hg.
