However, the impact of overweight or obesity on clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke is uncertain. The proposition of obesity paradox in stroke patients makes secondary prevention ambiguous for patients with ischemic stroke and overweight or obesity. Body mass index (BMI) or abdominal visceral fat area was used to measure obesity in previous studies. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a unique visceral fat, which has higher expression of proinflammatory genes than subcutaneous fat and abdominal visceral fat. And inflammation is closely related to the prognosis of ischemic stroke. In this study, the investigators assume EAT volume or attenuation evaluated by chest computed tomography (CT) scan might affect the prognosis of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients with the first acute ischemic stroke will be stratified into tertile groups based on EAT volume or attenuation. The primary endpoint measure is the proportion of patients with a favorable recovery of nerve function deficiency assessed by Modified Rankin Scale （mRS≤2） at 90 days after the onset of symptoms. Secondary endpoints include the following: the percentage of functional recovery measured by the Barthel Index (BI) at day 90 after stroke onset, the propotion of clinical improvement (with an improvement of ≥ 4 points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score or the resolution of the neurologic deficit) or neurological deterioration (with a decline by ≥ 4 points in the total National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score) at day 7 after stroke onset, incidence of hemorrhagic transformation and mortality within 7 days of symptom onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Epicardial adipose tissue","Obesity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lowest tertile","description":"Participants with lowest tertile of EAT volume or attenuation among all eligible participants.","interventionNames":["Other: Epicardial adipose tissue volume and attenuation"]},{"label":"Intermediate tertile","description":"Participants with intermediate tertile of EAT volume or attenuation among all eligible participants.","interventionNames":["Other: Epicardial adipose tissue volume and attenuation"]},{"label":"Highest tertile","description":"Participants with highest tertile of EAT volume or attenuation among all eligible participants.","interventionNames":["Other: Epicardial adipose tissue volume and attenuation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Epicardial adipose tissue volume and attenuation","description":"Epicardial adipose tissue volume and attenuation assessed by CT are the exposure factors in this study.","armGroupLabels":["Highest tertile","Intermediate tertile","Lowest tertile"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale (mRS)","description":"Assess patients' prognosis by the score of modified Rankin Scale.
