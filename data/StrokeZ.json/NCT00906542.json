In previous studies, a number of clinical (e.g., dysphagia, severe neurological impairment, mechanical ventilation), radiological (e.g., large infarctions in the territory of middle cerebral artery, insular infarction) and biochemical (e.g., increased serum levels of C-reactive protein, decreased levels of CD4+ T-lymphocytes) findings have been reported as risk factors of stroke-related chest infection. The present study (PRECAST) aims to identify a small set out of these previously described risk factors that can predict stroke-related pneumonia with high sensitivity and specificity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Pneumonia"],"keywords":["acute stroke","ischemic stroke","pneumonia","chest infection","brain lesion","lesion topology","dysphagia","sympathetic activation","immunosuppression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":530,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute ischemic stroke patients","description":"Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to the neurological intensive care unit or stroke unit within 24 hours after stroke onset in whom ischemic brain lesion was clearly assessed on CT and/or MRI"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"diagnosis of chest infection within 7 days after stroke","timeFrame":"days 1-7 after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute ischemic stroke\n* admission to the neurological intensive care unit or stroke unit within 24 hours after stroke onset\n* clearly assessed brain lesion location\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* previous large (non-lacunar) stroke\n* chest infection present already on hospital admission\n* mechanical ventilation already on day 1 or 2 after hospital admission\n* treatment with immunosuppressive drugs","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to the neurological intensive care unit or stroke unit within 24 hours after stroke onset","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Uwe Walter, MD","affiliation":"University of Rostock, Germany","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Rostock, Department of Neurology","city":"Rostock","zip":"D-18147","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":54.0887,"lon":12.14049}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"12939340","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Prass K, Meisel C, Hoflich C, Braun J, Halle E, Wolf T, Ruscher K, Victorov IV, Priller J, Dirnagl U, Volk HD, Meisel A.
