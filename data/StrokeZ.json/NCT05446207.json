In this study, we are going to find the effects of task oriented training with or without music therapy.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a neurological condition, which can promote disability and increase the susceptibility to secondary complications along the patient's life. Stroke issue incorporates motor dysfunction, Cognition, daily activity and sensory weaknesses. Music Therapy appears to affect physiological phenomena such as blood pressure, heartbeat, respiration, and mydriasis as well as emotional aspects such as mood and feelings. Task-oriented training is aimed at improving the control strategy by solving difficulties through various measures.\n\nIn general, a variety of techniques, including Bobath approach, Roods approach, Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques, motor relearning program, functional approaches, stretching exercises, therapeutic massage, constrain induced movement therapy, range of motion exercises, myofascial release, and strengthening exercises have been in practice for recovery of the affected limb functional mobility in patients with stroke. This study will evaluate the effects of music therapy along with task oriented training on balance and functional independence in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Stroke, Music Therapy, Task-oriented training, Balance, Functional Independence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"It will be single blinded study in which the outcome assessor will be unaware of the treatment intervention.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive routine physiotherapy with task oriented training.
