To fulfill the requirements of a proper home exercise program in walking rehabilitation for stroke victims, investigators structured the task-oriented exercise program with minimal supervision. This exercise program is structured with challenging walking-related activities based on motor learning principle and Gentile's progression of the motor task. The strengthening and balance components, aerobic conditioning and walking adaptability are composed of an exercise program to optimize walking ability. There are sixty minutes last ten exercises in each three progression steps of this exercise program. For the training effect to occur, each step of exercise program is designed by increasing demand of intensity in the range from moderate to vigorous. To confirming progressive energy demand, the purpose of this study is to investigate the intensity demand of three steps task- oriented home exercise program on walking competency in individual post stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","walking competency","Task-oriented exercise program","Exercise intensity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"7 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Structured, Progressive, Task-oriented exercise program","description":"The intervention is walking related task-oriented exercise program with three progressive steps at moderate to high intensity.
