This is a prospective, multi-centre, single arm, post approval, observational study. The clinical study will be conducted at up to 35 sites in China. Approximately 343 subjects will be enrolled in this study.\n\nThe total study duration is expected to be approximately 7 years. The study population included patients who have non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and are contraindicated to long-term oral anticoagulant; or patients who experience stroke or other thromboembolic event despite taking warfarin.\n\nScheduled office visits occur at 45 days (+45 days), 6M (+/- 3 weeks) 12M (+/- 6 weeks) and 24 M(+/- 6 weeks) post procedure; Phone contact follow up visits occur at, 36 M (+/- 6 weeks), 48M (+/- 6 weeks) and 60 M (+/- 6 weeks) post procedures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF)"],"keywords":["Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)","Anticoagulant","Warfarin","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":91,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug","description":"Subjects who were implanted with AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug will be included in this arm.","interventionNames":["Device: AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug","description":"The AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug is a transcatheter, self-expanding device intended for use in preventing thrombus embolization from the left atrial appendage.
