ApTOLL is an aptamer able to antagonize TLR4 receptor and, therefore, to reduce the inflammatory response.","detailedDescription":"This Phase I clinical trial is divided in two parts: the first part (part A) is a single dose escalation study and the second (part B) is a multiple dose study. Both are performed in healthy volunteers.\n\n* First part: a single dose, i.v. administration (slow infusion), dose escalation with a maximum of 7 single dose levels, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution), in healthy subjects.\n* Second part: a multiple dose, i.v. administration (slow infusion), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution), in healthy subjects.\n\nThe main objectives of this study are:\n\n1. To evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ApTOLL in healthy volunteers, after single dose administration in fasting conditions, following an ascending dosing scheme.\n2. To evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ApTOLL in healthy volunteers, after multiple dose administration in fasting conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Healthy volunteers","ApTOLL"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ApTOLL single dose","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"ApTOLL is administered intravenously in a single ascending dose pattern in seven dose levels (0.7mg - 70mg).
