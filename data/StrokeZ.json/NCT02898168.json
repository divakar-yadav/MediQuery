It is considered significant effects on their Quality of Life(QOL).\n\nFurther methods of rehabilitation are required for convalescent patients to recover their function soon and better, due to a multitudes of recovery patient with troubles such as gait problem.\n\nThis trial is studying to investigate the effects of gait training with a functional electrical stimulation (FES) 'WalkAide\\[R\\](WA)' to improve the lower-limb function and ambulation in convalescent stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This study is targeting convalescent patients within 6 months after the onset of initial stroke (cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage) and also observing the foot drop during walking.\n\nSome study for the patients after the onset of stroke (over several months) are reported that a case of the efficacy by the treatment using the FES, and another case of using FES indicated the equal efficacy and the higher QOL compared to using ankle-foot orthosis(AFO).\n\nHowever, these are clinical research results overseas and there are not so many studies targeting only for convalescent stroke patients.\n\nFES which recover the lost function by paralysis using electrical stimulation is recommended as convalescent rehabilitation by Japanese Guidelines for the Management of Stroke 2015 etc..\n\nThe purpose of FES treatment is the electrical stimulation to peroneal nerve of patients with foot drop and equinus foot due to central nervous system damage and the objective efficacy is following:\n\n* To improve the walking by dorsiflexing the foot during swing phase\n* To prevention and suppression of disuse atrophy\n* To increase local blood flow\n* To re-educate muscle\n* To maintain or increase the range of joint motion"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Rehabilitation","WalkAide (WA)","Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":202,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"WA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: WA group"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"WA group","description":"Conventional rehabilitation therapy and gait training with WAIntervention with WA is scheduled 40min/day, five times a week, for 8 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["WA"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control","description":"Conventional rehabilitation therapy and gait training without WA.","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"maximum walking distance of 6 Minute Walk Test (bare feet)","description":"Measuring maximum walking distance of 6 Minute Walk Test at baseline and after 8-weeks intervention.
