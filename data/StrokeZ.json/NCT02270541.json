in-ambulance telemedicine during Paramedic Intervention Team transportation of patients with suspicion of acute stroke.\n\nThe implementation of expert stroke support in the pre-hospital arena using in-ambulance telemedicine is an innovative approach that opens up new perspectives and allows continuous guidance by a stroke specialist throughout the acute stroke care continuum."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Telemedicine","Prehospital","Emergency
