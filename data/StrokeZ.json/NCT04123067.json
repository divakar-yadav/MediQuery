The rationale for the proposed research is to develop an acute intervention that can improve neurological recovery and decrease mortality and morbidity in high-risk diabetic stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded stroke intervention study. Patients presenting with hyperglycemia (blood glucose level = or \\> than 150mg/dl) and acute stroke symptoms within 12h of onset will be randomized to either treatment with PGZ or placebo. Patients will receive oral drug vs placebo once daily for three consecutive days. Blood samples will be obtained at baseline and during the subsequent three days to collect various biomarkers of the stress-immune response following ischemic stroke. Clinical outcomes (NIH-SS and mRS) will be determined at 3 months. Secondary outcome measures are changes in the various blood biomarkers comparing both study groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Hyperglycemia","Diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pioglitazone treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"oral administration of 45mg Pioglitazone daily for three subsequent days, initiated within 12h of stroke symptom onset","interventionNames":["Drug: Pioglitazone 45 mg"]},{"label":"Placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Oral administration of placebo daily for three subsequent days, initiated within 12h of stroke symptom onset","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo oral tablet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pioglitazone 45 mg","description":"45mg Pioglitazone daily for three subsequent days, initiated within 12h of stroke symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["Pioglitazone treatment group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo oral tablet","description":"placebo daily for three subsequent days, initiated within 12h of stroke symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["Placebo group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Neurological Status","description":"NIH-Stroke scale (0-42) to assess neurological function with 0 being no deficits and 42 being the worst score","timeFrame":"90 days post stroke"},{"measure":"Degree of Disability or Dependence in the Daily Activities","description":"Measured using the modified Rankin Scale (0-6) to assess neurological function with a score of 0 for no neurological deficits and a maximum of 6 for an expired patient","timeFrame":"90 days post stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Concentration of Markers of Neutrophil Activation and Function","description":"measured in blood by flow cytometry","timeFrame":"24 hours, 48 hours, and 90 days post-stroke"},{"measure":"Concentration of Stress Response Markers Including Cortisol, Norepinephrine and Epinephrine","description":"measured in blood","timeFrame":"24 hours, 48 hours, and 90 days poststroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
