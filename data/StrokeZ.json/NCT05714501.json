Subject is eligible for thrombolytic therapy and thrombolytic therapy was administered without delay and per current practice guidelines.\n7. For strokes in the anterior circulation, the following imaging criteria should be met:\n\n   1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) criterion: volume of diffusion restriction visually assessed as ≤ 50 mL, or Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 6-10; OR\n   2.

Clinical symptoms of bilateral stroke or stroke in multiple territories.\n20. Known history of cerebral vasculitis.\n21. Evidence of active systemic infection (e.g. septicemia). Exceptions: common cold, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n22. Any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency.\n23. Evidence of current intracranial hemorrhage on imaging.\n24. Significant mass effect with midline shift.\n25. Known arterial condition in a proximal vessel that requires treatment or prevents access to the site of occlusion or safe recovery of the investigational device (for example, severe stenosis, complete occlusion in the cervical ICA, tandem occlusion).\n26. Suspicion or evidence of aortic dissection, septic embolus, or bacterial endocarditis.\n27. Evidence of dissection in the extracranial or intracranial cerebral arteries.\n28. Excessive arterial tortuosity that may preclude device placement as determined by CTA/Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and/or conventional angiography.\n29. Evidence of multiple vascular occlusions (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, anterior/posterior circulation, concurrent occlusions in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and MCA, other concurrent ipsilateral occlusions in the same or different territories).\n30.
