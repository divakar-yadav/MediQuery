Y-2 sublingual tablet is an innovative drug developed by Yantai yinuoyi Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd. with independent intellectual property rights. This product is a free radical scavenger and inflammatory protein expression inhibitor. It can clear hydroxyl free radical (COH), nitric oxide free radical (no) and peroxynitrite ion (onoa), and inhibit the expression of tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-a), interleukin IP (IL-1 (3), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and other inflammatory related proteins induced by cerebral ischemia. By clearing the excessive free radicals produced in the brain tissue during ischemia and reperfusion and inhibiting the secondary inflammatory reaction, we can reduce the damage of free radicals and inflammatory reaction to the brain tissue, block the pathological change process caused by cerebral ischemia from two ways, and play a synergistic therapeutic role in cerebral ischemia injury.","detailedDescription":"At present, the treatment of acute ischemic stroke includes intravenous thrombolysis, intravascular interventional therapy (including arterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, angioplasty and stent implantation), antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy, defibrasion therapy, volume expansion therapy, and neuroprotective therapy.
