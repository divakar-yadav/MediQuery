It is one of the complications that significantly affects the rehabilitation of patients.The suprascapular nerve takes up 70% of the sensation of the shoulder joint. For this reason, suprascapular nerve block treatment is applied in the treatment of hemiplegic shoulder pain.In patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain, suprascapular nerve block therapy can be performed under ultrasound guidance or using anatomical landmarks. However, there is no study in the literature comparing the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided and unguided suprascapular nerve block in the treatment of hemiplegic shoulder pain Patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain among the patients who received routine conservative rehabilitation treatment in the physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic with the diagnosis of post-stroke hemiplegia will be included in the study.\n\nHemiplegic patients aged 25-75 years, with shoulder pain lasting for 3 months and with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) value \\> 3 during passive shoulder joint movement will be included in the study.\n\nExclusion criteria from the study will be determined as mini mental test score \\< 24, uncontrolled diabetes, coagulopathy, botulinum toxin administration in the last six months, any injection from the shoulder region in the last six months, and hypersensitivity to injection agents.\n\nIt will be organized as a prospective randomized study. It is planned to include 50 patients in the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups in equal numbers, stratified by age and sex.\n\nPatients in group 1 will be applied with ultrasound-guided suprascapular nerve block.\n\nPatients in Group 2 will be applied with suprascapular nerve block using defined anatomical points without ultrasound guidance.\n\nInitially, demographic data, medical history, stroke etiology, duration of stroke, body mass index, hemiplegic side information of the patients will be obtained.\n\nPatients in both groups will be evaluated in terms of shoulder joint range of motion, Visual Analogue Scale, Brunnstrom Stages of Stroke Recovery, Barthel Index, Modified Ashworth Scale, The Beck Depression Inventory before the treatment, at the 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month after the injection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ultrasound-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ultrasound-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block","interventionNames":["Drug: Ultrasound-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block"]},{"label":"Anatomical Landmark-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anatomical Landmark-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block","interventionNames":["Drug: Anatomical Landmark-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ultrasound-guided Suprascapular Nerve Block","description":"For suprascapular nerve block, a solution consisting of 5 ml 2% lidocaine, 1 ml Betamethasone dipropionate + Betamethasone sodium phosphate (6.43 mg/ml + 2.63 mg/ml), 4 ml saline will be used.\n\nInjections will be applied to patients in a sitting position and arm by the side.
