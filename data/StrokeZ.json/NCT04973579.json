A study involving clinical data evaluation of truly simultaneous treatment outcomes in patients deemed to require carotid revascularization at the time of surgical cardiac intervention (single-stage, simultaneous treatment). An open-label study, without randomization - a single arm study.\n\nAcademic Registry - scientific activity of the Faculty of Medicine, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University and John Paul II Hospital.","detailedDescription":"The coexistence of symptomatic or unstable stroke-threatening carotid atherosclerotic stenosis with cardiac disease requiring urgent / fast-track cardiac surgery (such as advanced unstable or multivessel coronary artery disease, recent myocardial infarction or pulmonary edema, severely impaired myocardial contractility, and/or severe valvular disease requiring surgical treatment) represents a major medical and therapeutic/logistics challenge.\n\nAccording to current guidelines, in absence of prospective randomized evidence, the most appropriate management strategy for a given patient should be determined by a multispecialty team. In hemodynamically compromised patients sequential treatment (i.e., first carotid stenosis repair followed by surgery or first cardiac surgery followed by carotid stenosis treatment, either surgical or endovascular) is associated with a high risk of cardiac complications in case of first-stage carotid stenosis treatment and a high risk of neurological complications in case of the first-stage cardiac surgery.\n\nIn this challenging patient group, we have introduced single-stage, truly simultaneous procedure. The fundament of the strategy is to establish extracorporeal circulation back-up (\"CEC standby\") prior to the minimally invasive (endovascular) treatment of stroke-threatening carotid artery stenosis in the hybrid room under single anesthesia.\n\nFor CAS (proximal or distal protected), in case of suboptimal femoral access (or lack of femoral access), a direct access via carotid artery is used (transcervical or transcarotid revascularization), this is immediately followed by cardiac surgery.\n\nThe procedure, each time, follows recommendation of the Multispecialty Team (Heart Team + NeuroVascular Team) as the lowest-deemed risk management in patients with indications for both urgent both carotid revascularization and cardiac surgery. Both carotid and cardiac treatment are performed under single anesthesia with the feasibility of immediate extracorporeal circulation support during carotid revascularization in case of hemodynamic collapse.\n\nEligibility for treatment is based on the decision (recommendation) of a multidisciplinary Heart Team along with a NeuroVascular Team consisting of a cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, angiologist, neurologist, and vascular surgeon, with the concomitant use of routine pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological prevention - according to current guidelines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Stenosis","Coronary Artery Disease","Valvular Heart Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Pulmonary Edema With Heart Failure"],"keywords":["Carotid Stenosis","Coronary Artery Disease, Valvular Disease","Heart Failure, Pulmonary Edema","Single Anesthesia","Simultaneous Procedure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Simultaneous cardiac surgery and carotid stenting","description":"Patients with Heart Team and NeuroVascular Team recommendation to perform simutaneous (single anaesthesia) carotid artery stenting with MicroNet covered stent (CGuard) including proximal or distal neuroembolic protection and cardiac surgery (CABG or surgical valve replacement / repair procedure)","interventionNames":["Procedure: Simutaneous (single anaesthesia) carotid artery stenting with MicroNet covered stent (CGuard) and cardiac surgery (CABG or surgical valve replacement / repair procedure)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Simutaneous (single anaesthesia) carotid artery stenting with MicroNet covered stent (CGuard) and cardiac surgery (CABG or surgical valve replacement / repair procedure)","description":"The registry enrolls patients qualified for treatment with the methods evaluated in the registry, using routinely applicable procedures and devices.\n\nIn cardiac surgery -
