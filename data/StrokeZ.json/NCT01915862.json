Also, patients' medical history, previous medical treatment and cardiovascular risk factors are registered.\n\nFunctional outcome is assessed by the modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months. Also, stroke recurrence and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality will be assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","Blood pressure variability","Ambulatory arterial stiffness index","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring","Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":353,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS)","description":"Description (score)\n\n* No symptoms at all (0)\n* No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities (1)\n* Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance (2)\n* Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance (3)\n* Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance (4)\n* Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention(5)\n* Dead (6)","timeFrame":"Three months (90 days)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke\n* Admission within 24 after the onset of symptoms\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Transient ischemic attack\n* Intracerebral hemorrhage\n* Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n* Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis\n* Stroke mimics\n* Late admission (\\>24 hours after stroke onset)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All consecutive patients admitted to Departments of Medicine of three University Hospitals (Thessaloniki, Larissa, Ioannina) with the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Apostolos I.
