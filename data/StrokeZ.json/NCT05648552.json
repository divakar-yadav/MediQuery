Recently, many previous studies suggested exploring the functional reorganization of the motor function among post-stroke survivors is urgent to be solved in both clinical work and applied basic research. Investigating the structural connectivity (SC) of the brain could visualize the anatomical connections between different brain regions and exploring the functional connectivity (FC) could reveal the functional activity patterns of the human brain in resting- and task- states. Previous studies suggested that SC-FC coupling analysis may shed light on exploring biological markers for the assessment and treatment of motor deficits in post-stroke survivors. The current study aims to reveal the SC-FC coupling pattern and its relationship with motor function in post-stroke survivors with motor dysfunction by multimodal MRI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Motor Activity"],"keywords":["Stroke","Motor dysfunction","MRI","structural connectivity","functional connectivity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke group","description":"Chronic subcortical stroke participants with motor dysfunction"},{"label":"Healthy controls group","description":"Well-matched healthy controls"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Structural-functional Connectivity Coupling","description":"The coupling between structural connectivity and functional connectivity","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Assessing the motor function in post-stroke participants","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Chinese version of Modified Barthel Index","description":"Assessing the activities of daily living in post-stroke participants","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"},{"measure":"Broetz Hand Test","description":"Assessing the hemiplegic hand performance in post-stroke participants","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"},{"measure":"Placebo Questionnaire","description":"Self-evaluation of rehabilitation treatment in post-stroke participants","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"},{"measure":"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale","description":"Assessing the depression in post-stroke participants","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"},{"measure":"Chinese (Putonghua) Version of Oxford Cognitive Screen","description":"Assessing the cognition in post-stroke participants","timeFrame":"Within 1 week after enrollment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
