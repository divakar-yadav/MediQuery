The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance and safety of the MyoRegulator® device in active versus sham treated stroke patients with lower-limb spasticity after 5 consecutive days of treatment.","detailedDescription":"Spasticity prevalence after stroke is highly variable, ranging from 17% to 43% three months post-stroke. In the lower limbs, adduction and extension of the knee with equinovarus foot is the most observed pattern. Spasticity can lead to pain, ankylosis, and tendon retraction which may limit the potential success of rehabilitation. Spasticity can also affect quality-of-life and can be highly detrimental to daily activities such as walking.\n\nAn initial clinical trial of safety and feasibility suggested that five sessions of treatment with the MyoRegulator® device temporarily reduces spasticity and overall stiffness of the affected extremity with optimal reductions in spasticity occurring 2-3 weeks post stimulation intervention.\n\nMyoRegulator® is a non-invasive neuromodulation device using multi-site direct current stimulation for the treatment of spasticity. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance and safety of the MyoRegulator® device in active versus sham treated patients during and after 5 consecutive days of treatment sessions. Patients can take part in an optional 3-month follow-up.\n\nThe primary performance endpoint is defined as the reduction in ankle joint spasticity. The study will be considered to have a successful outcome if the actively treated subjects demonstrate a statistically greater reduction in spasticity, as measured by the Tardieu Scale, as compared to the sham treated subjects after five treatment sessions.\n\nThe primary safety endpoint is defined as the incidence of device-related serious adverse events. The safety of the device will be demonstrated if there are no incidents of serious adverse events caused or contributed to by the device treatment that are clinically unacceptable in light of the treatment benefits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Muscle Spasticity","Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke rehabilitation","spasticity","neuromodulation","trans-spinal direct current
