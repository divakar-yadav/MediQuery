This study will enroll 75 subacute stroke patients with unilateral motor dysfunction. Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of porcine brain peptide to improve motor recovery measured by the improvement ratio of Fugl-Meyer assessment ((score of FMA after 3 weeks - score of FMA at baseline) / score of FMA at baseline) in patients with subacute stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrolysin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":71,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study Group 1: 30ml Cerebrolysin","interventionNames":["Drug: porcine brain peptide (Cerebrolysin)"]},{"label":"Study Group 2","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Study Group 2: Placebo (0.9% NaCl)","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"porcine brain peptide (Cerebrolysin)","armGroupLabels":["Study Group 1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Study Group 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the improvement ratio of Fugl-Meyer assessment","description":"Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of porcine brain peptide to improve motor recovery measured by the improvement ratio of Fugl-Meyer assessment ((score of FMA after 3 weeks - score of FMA at baseline) / score of FMA at baseline) in patients with subacute stroke","timeFrame":"after 3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 1st cortical or subcortical unilateral infarction (supratentorial lesion)\n2.
