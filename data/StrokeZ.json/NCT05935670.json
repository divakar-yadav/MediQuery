No studies have examined how femoral blood flow responds to both passive leg movement, a measure of microvascular function, as well as active leg contractions, a measure of the hyperemic response to exercise. Leg muscles with a reduced blood flow response to movement could be associated with decreased neuromuscular function, such as leg strength and fatigue. Preliminary data showing a single bout of ischemic conditioning may improve vascular function and muscle activation in healthy adults and individuals post-stroke. Therefore, the investigators want to examine if ischemic conditioning will also improve the blood flow response to passive leg movements as well as during single leg active contractions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Vascular Diseases","Ischemic"],"keywords":["Ischemic Conditioning","Blood Flow","Peripheral Microvascular Function","Neuromuscular Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"The investigators will enroll and complete visits for 30 individuals within the study including individuals post-stroke (n = 10), their age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 10), and young healthy controls (CONyoung, n = 10).
