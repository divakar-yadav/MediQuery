In addition, researchers want to learn about the relative risk of ischemic stroke when such patients did not continue OAC treatment.","detailedDescription":"The primary objectives of the study are to determine the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients registered in the British primary care THIN database and to investigate the OAC exposure, OAC treatment patterns and the relative risk of having an ischemic stroke in relation to OAC treatment for a subgroup of patients, who were diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) prior to ischemic stroke.\n\nSecondary objectives are to determine the number of patients having NVAF diagnosed at the time of ischemic stroke and within 1 and 12 months after ischemic stroke; to describe cardiovascular risk factors for ischemic stroke and pharmacological treatments before and 12 months after ischemic stroke, and to estimate the case-fatality at 1 and 12 months after the occurrence of ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)","Oral anticoagulants (OAC)","Vitamin K antagonists
