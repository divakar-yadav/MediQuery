The patients will be randomized to receive either cilnidipine 10-20mg or losartan 50-100mg once daily for 4 weeks with a target systolic blood pressure of \\< 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of \\< 90mmHg. After 4-week treatment, all patients will receive follow-up SPECT and blood pressure evaluation. For the quantitative CBF analysis, SPECT will be performed with a single machine in one center.\n\nOutcome Measures: Primary outcome measure is the percentile change of global CBF on SPECT between pre- and post-treatments. Secondary outcome measures include the percentile change of regional CBF, the proportion of patients less than 8.6% decrease of global CBF, and the change of NIHSS score."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension","Stroke"],"keywords":["CHERISH","Ischemic
