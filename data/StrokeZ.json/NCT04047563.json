There are hidden stem cells in the brain, which becomes active following injury to the brain. Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal progenitor cells in the brain to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons and blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic activity and also increases cerebral blood flow when administered following ischemia. It was discovered that in rat model of ischemic stroke, sovateltide, significantly improved survival, reduces neurological and motor function deficit while effectively decreasing infarct volume, edema and oxidative stress. The convincing results of preclinical efficacy studies of Sovateltide in ischemic stroke and its safety affirmation from phase I and phase II clinical studies encouraged us to investigate its efficacy in human patients of ischemic stroke. In the present prospective, multicentric, randomized, double-blind, parallel, saline-controlled phase II clinical study; the investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of Sovateltide therapy along with standard supportive care in patients of acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia","Cerebral Infarction","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Endothelin","Neurogenesis","Neural progenitor cells"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"In PMZ group, 3 doses of PMZ-1620, at 0.3 μg/kg body weight will be administered as an intravenous bolus over 1 minute every 3 hours ± 1 hour on day 1, 3, and day 6 (total dose/day: 0.9 µg/kg body weight).\n\nIn control group, 3 doses of equal volume of normal saline will be administered as an IV bolus over 1 minutes every 3 hours ± 1 hour on day 1, 3 and day 6 post randomization.\n\nIn both treatment groups, subjects will be provided the best available standard of care.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":158,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normal Saline + Standard of care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive the best available standard of care.
