Various studies have used different stimulation set-ups, some based on prior structural and functional brain mapping in order to choose the optimal stimulation region. An additional approach that was found beneficial is stimulation of the left primary motor area (M1). A major advantage of this approach is its relative simplicity that may increase the application of this intervention in clinical settings. This intervention approach has been studied in patients with chronic aphasia and targeted on naming ability. In the current study the investigators aim to study the influence of a stimulation set-up at M1 in stroke patients suffering from aphasia that are in the sub-acute stage. In addition the investigators aim to study additional language functions including pragmatics and grammar. The study will include 30 patients suffering from aphasia which are in the sub-acute stage. The patients will undergo complete language assessments at 3 time points: baseline, post intervention (third week from recruitment) and one month follow-up. The study group will include 15 patients that will undergo TDCS at the left M1 region followed by naming therapy. The intervention will be given daily for duration of two weeks (5 days/week). The control group will include 15 patients that will undergo the same protocol apart from sham TDCS. The effect of the intervention will be examined taking into account the extent and location of the brain damage on language functions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"],"keywords":["tDCS","aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TDCS stimulation at the left M1 region followed by naming therapy.
