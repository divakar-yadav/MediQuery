Once the rehabilitation period is finished, a reduction of functional and motor abilities is often observed in subjects when they returned home.\n\nThis study will examine if loading daily the non paretic leg with additional weights will improve walking abilities. This study will enroll 100 people who had a stroke \\> three months and \\< five years and who still experienced difficulties for walking.\n\nEach patient will receive 3 months of intervention targeting their non affected leg. Half of the subjects will have to wear braces with additional weights at the non affected ankle during the day ( \\> 6 hours), while the other half will wear a similar brace but without weight.\n\nA six minutes walking test will be given before and after the intervention, as well six and twelve months later to measure the effect of these interventions. The investigators hypothesize that people receiving the additional weights to the non paretic leg will show greater improvements in their walk abilities."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Resistance training","Walking","Weight bearing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Weighted brace","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Weighted brace"]},{"label":"non weighted brace","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Non weighted brace"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Weighted brace","description":"People will have to wear all the day additional weights (between 2 and 4 kilograms) at the nonparetic ankle during 3 months","armGroupLabels":["Weighted brace"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Non weighted brace","description":"People will be given a brace with no weight they will have to wear all the day during three months.","armGroupLabels":["non weighted brace"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Six minutes walking test","description":"Total distance walked in meters (6MWD) within the 6 minutes.","timeFrame":"3 months after the inclusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"six minutes walking test","description":"Total distance walked in meters (6MWD) within the 6 minutes","timeFrame":"6 months after the inclusion"},{"measure":"six minutes walking test","description":"Total distance walked in meters (6MWD) within the 6 minutes","timeFrame":"12 months after the inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hemiparesis following ischemic or hemorrhagic infarct of a single hemisphere\n* First episode of stroke experienced \\> 3 months and \\< 5 years prior to study enrolment\n* Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) score \\> 3 \\< 8\n* Be able to walk few meters without physical assistance\n* Able to understand and follow instructions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Following inpatient physical rehabilitation\n* Experienced more than 2 falls during 3 months prior inclusion\n* Signs of bilateral impairments\n* Daily use of a wheelchair to move\n* Contra-indications for daily walk\n* Currently participating in any clinical trial with a experimental walking intervention\n* Severe arthrosis\n* Dementia","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Regnaux, PhD","affiliation":"French School of Public Health (EHESP)","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sainte Anne Hospital","city":"Paris","zip":"75674","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4804","name":"Body Weight","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
