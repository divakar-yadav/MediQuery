The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus standard medical management (SMM) in patients who suffer a distal medium vessel occlusion (DMVO) stroke within 12 hours from time last seen well (TLSW) and have evidence of salvageable brain tissue on perfusion imaging. Randomization will be done under a minimization process using age (≤67 vs. \\>67 years), baseline NIHSS (≤12 vs. \\>12), use of IV thrombolysis (none vs. within 120 minutes from randomization vs. \\> 120 minutes from randomization), site of occlusion (M2 vs. M3 vs. ACA vs. PCA), baseline infarct volume (≤15mL vs. \\>15-30mL vs. \\>30-50mL), perfusion mismatch volume (≤15mL vs. \\>15-30mL vs. \\>30-50mL), therapeutic window (0-4.5 vs. 4.5-8 or \\>9-12 hours after TLKW), and participating site. The candidate enriched populations that the trial considers are based on use of intravenous thrombolysis (none vs. within 120 minutes from randomization vs. \\> 120 minutes from randomization), TLKW to randomization (0-6 vs. 6-12 hours) and mismatch volumes as measured using absolute mismatch (defined as Tmax\\>6 sec - DWI lesion on MRI or Tmax\\>6 sec -rCBF\\<30% lesion on CTP) (\\>40 cc vs. \\>30cc vs. \\>20cc vs. \\>10cc). The primary endpoint will be a categorical shift across all levels on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90-days post-randomization. The hypothesis is that EVT will lead to an improved clinical outcome at 90 days. Interim analysis will be performed after the primary endpoint is available for a total of 386 randomized patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with the use of Trevo NXT ProVue Retrievers, AXS Vecta 46 Intermediate Catheter and AXS Catalyst 5 Distal Access Catheter, versus standard medical management (SMM) in patients who suffer a distal medium vessel occlusion (DMVO) stroke within 12 hours from time last seen well (TLSW) and have evidence of salvageable brain tissue on perfusion imaging.
