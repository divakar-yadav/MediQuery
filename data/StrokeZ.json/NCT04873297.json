The aim of the study was to assess whether regular treatment with metoclopramide, a D2-receptor antagonist with antiemetic and gastric prokinetic actions, could reduce the rate of pneumonia.","detailedDescription":"Patients admitted with no signs of pneumonia within 7 days of stroke onset and 48 hours of insertion of a nasogastric tube will be recruited into a single-blind randomized placebo-controlled study who will admit in Neurology Department, PIMS. Participants will receive metoclopramide 10 mg or placebo 3 times daily via the nasogastric tube for 4 days. Clinical signs of pneumonia will be recorded on alternate days. Pneumonia will be diagnosed if the patient has relevant clinical signs, high inflammatory markers, and new infiltrates on the chest radiograph. A sample size of 106 patients is calculated, 53 patients in each group. Non-probability consecutive sampling will be used for recruitment of participants. Study duration will be six months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Aspiration Pneumonia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"After taking permission from the Hospital Ethical Committee this study will be conducted at the Neurology department of PIMS.

Patients beings grouped into 2 subgroup via lottery method. One group is given metoclopramide and one group will be given placebo (normal saline). SPSS version 23 will be used for data analysis.
