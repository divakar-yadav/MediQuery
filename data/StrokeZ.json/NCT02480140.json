SR is proposed to produce an added effect to the effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with subacute stroke. It was hypothesized that participants receiving the combined treatment (SR and CIMT) would have a better functional regain.","detailedDescription":"Background - Emerging research suggests the use of self-regulation (SR) strategies at improving functional regain in patients with brain injury. SR is proposed to produce an added effect to the effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).\n\nObjective - This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with sub-acute stroke.\n\nMethods - Seventy-six patients were randomly assigned to the self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy (SR-CIMT; n=25), constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT; n=27) or conventional functional rehabilitation (control; n=24) groups, and completed the trial.\n\nThe SR-CIMT intervention was two-week therapist-guided training using the SR strategy to reflect on the relearning of functional tasks with CIMT. Outcome measurements were for upper limb function (Action Research Arm Test, ARAT, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, FMA), daily task performance (Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Lawton IADL) and self-perceived functional ability (Motor Activity Log, MAL) at pre and post intervention intervals, and at one month follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Self-regulation","Constraint-induced movement therapy","Stroke","Functional recovery","Randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy (SR-CIMT) - participants' non-hemiplegic arm was restrained in a mitt for 4 hours every day, 2 weeks, 5 days a week (therapy days) (CIMT) (the same CIMT protocol as in the CIMT group described under 'comparator/control treatment'); participants were taught using the self-regulation (SR) strategy to relearn the tasks; SR strategy involved participants self reflecting on their abilities and deficits in performing the tasks, identifying problems and solutions in achieving the most independence in the tasks, and then actually carrying out the tasks.","interventionNames":["Other: Self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy"]},{"label":"Constraint-induced movement therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In the constraint-induced movement therapy group (CIMT), participants' non-hemiplegic arm was restrained in a mitt for 4 hours every day, 2 weeks, 5 days a week (therapy days); therapist provided demonstration on the adapted task performance with one arm (the side of participants' hemiplegic arm), and participants to practice the tasks with the unrestrained hemiplegic arm under supervision.","interventionNames":["Other: Constraint-induced movement therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional occupational therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"It involved therapist to demonstrate the adapted task performance followed by patient's practice under supervision.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional occupational therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy","description":"There were 10 tasks to practice in total, they included fold laundry, put clothes on hanger, brush teeth, dress upper garment, dress lower garment in week one; and use telephone, prepare a cup of tea, sweep floor, wash towel, wash dishes in week two.
