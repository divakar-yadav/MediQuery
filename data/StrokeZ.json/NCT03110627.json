Oral anticoagulation can prevent most strokes in patients with AF; provided that AF is recognized before a stroke occurs. Up to about 40% of incident AF may be sub-clinical, producing minimal or no symptoms, or being too short to allow detection.\n\nDX AF is a prospective, randomized-controlled, open-label trial. Patients who are identified on clinical grounds for a single-chamber ICD will be randomized to a VDD ICD (experimental group) or single chamber ICD (control group).\n\nThe study will compare the Dx-ICD system (experimental) to standard VVI-ICD (control) on the ability to diagnose silent AF in patients without prior AF receiving an ICD for standard indications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Arrhythmias","Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter","Cardiovascular Diseases","Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators"],"keywords":["Single-chamber ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator)","Cardiac Arrhythmias","Atrial fibrillation","Atrial flutter","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"DX AF is a prospective, randomized-controlled, open-label trial.
