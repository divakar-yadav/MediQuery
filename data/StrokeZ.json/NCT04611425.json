This situation has quickly led to massive shortage in masks, mechanical ventilation machines and common medications such as hypnotics. The reasons for such shortage are multiple: dramatic increase of the demand, production discontinuation because of shutdowns in multiple countries, and withholding of products by producing countries. All countries over the world are currently experiencing a major shortage in basic hypnotic medications (propofol, midazolam) in the intensive care as well as in the operating theatre. Remimazolam is a novel benzodiazepine with a short half-life that has been administered in patients undergoing major surgery, as well as in the intensive care unit. The Principal Investigator proposes to perform a pilot study assessing the benefit-risk ratio of Remimazolam in the critical care units of Nantes University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Respiratory Failure","COVID-19","Trauma","Stroke","Sepsis","Shock"],"keywords":["Remimazolam","Sedation","Shortage","Critical care","COVID-19"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Non-controlled","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Remimazolam","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive an infusion of Remimazolam for a maximum duration of 48 hours.\n\nThe dose of Remimazolam will be adapted according to our ICU protocol of analgesia-sedation management, based on validated scale (Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale)","interventionNames":["Drug: Remimazolam"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Remimazolam","description":"Patients will receive an infusion of Remimazolam for a maximum duration of 48 hours.
