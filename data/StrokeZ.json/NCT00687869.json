To achieve this, patients in the intervention group have the opportunity to choose, specifically and according to their own needs, from the offers of a web portal and a telephone hotline, from individual counselling and info sessions as well as from home visits. Patients in the control group receive patient-information-notes beyond primary care. There will be qualitative interviews with the persons concerned and/or their relatives in both groups in order to validate the instruments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","patient care management","patient participation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":322,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Case management","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Case management with patient-information-notes, telephone hotline, individual counselling using home visits, e-mail and telephone contact, web portal","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Case management"]},{"label":"usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual stroke aftercare plus patient-information-notes","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Case management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Case management","description":"Case management with patient-information-notes, telephone hotline, individual counselling using home visits, e-mail and telephone contact, web portal","armGroupLabels":["Case management"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Case management","description":"Usual stroke aftercare plus patient-information-notes","armGroupLabels":["usual care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"physical scale of the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0","timeFrame":"before discharge from acute care, four weeks after discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation (in case of referral to a medical rehabilitation) immediately before randomization (baseline assessment), and 12 months after randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Health related quality of life, depression, mortality, recurrent stroke and/or TIA/PRIND","timeFrame":"before discharge from acute care, four weeks after discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation (in case of referral to a medical rehabilitation) immediately before randomization (baseline assessment), and 12 months after randomization"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke or intra-cerebral bleeding) with signs and symptoms of an acute stroke according to the diagnosis I61 and I63 of the ICD-10-GM 2008\n* Differentiation between ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke by the use of CT or MRT\n* Resident in Saxony-Anhalt or Saxony or Thuringia\n* Able to understand German language\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Reinfarction\n* Alcoholism\n* Death in acute care\n* NIHHS \\> 25\n* Homelessness","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Johann Behrens, Prof. Dr.","affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Medical faculty, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale)","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Medical faculty, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale)","city":"Halle (Saale)","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":51.48159,"lon":11.97948}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25920942","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Saal S, Becker C, Lorenz S, Schubert M, Kuss O, Stang A, Muller T, Kraft A, Behrens J.
