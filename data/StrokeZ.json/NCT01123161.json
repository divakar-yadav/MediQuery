Research has shown that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-a naturally occurring protein that opens blocked arteries by dissolving blood clots - activates the body's ability to dissolve recently formed blood clots and reduces or prevents the brain damage caused by a stroke.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of tPA for people having a stroke when taken within 3 hours of stroke onset.\n\nResearchers believe that a lower body temperature (hypothermia) may be beneficial while a stroke is happening because hypothermia may prevent further brain injury, or may make the stroke less damaging.\n\nPatients will receive a standard stroke evaluation, which includes blood tests, a computed tomography (CT) scan, complete physical and neurological examinations, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) to determine eligibility for the study.\n\nThere are two study groups - tPA alone or tPA with cooling (hypothermia). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study groups. Length of participation (including observation after the patient leaves the hospital) is 90 days.\n\nThis study is part of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS), which allows researchers to enhance and initiate translational research that ultimately will benefit stroke patients by treating more patients in less than 2 hours, and finding ways to treat additional patients later."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Hypothermia","Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action","Cerebral Infarction","Hematologic Agents","Stroke","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Tissue Plasminogen Activator","Central Nervous System Diseases","Fibrinolytic Agents","Cardiovascular Agents","Body Temperature Changes","Brain Diseases","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Pharmacologic Actions","Signs and Symptoms","Fibrin Modulating Agents","Therapeutic Uses","Brain Ischemia","Cardiovascular Diseases","Brain Infarction","Plasminogen","cooling","tPA","thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized to normothermia or hypothermia","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group1: IV t-PA and normothermia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV tpa and normothermia","interventionNames":["Drug: Group1: IV t-PA and normothermia"]},{"label":"Group 2 : IV t-PA and hypothermia and anti-shivering treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV tpa and hypothermia and anti-shivering treatment","interventionNames":["Device: hypothermia and anti-shivering treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"hypothermia and anti-shivering treatment","description":"Hypothermia is induced using the Celsius Control™ System.
