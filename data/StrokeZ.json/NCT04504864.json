Aspirin is the most widely used anti-thrombotic drug in the secondary prevention of patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that conventional doses of aspirin can increase the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients with cerebral microbleeds. For such patients, how to carry out effective and safe anti-thrombotic therapy is still unclear.\n\nThe AIM study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of low-dose Aspirin (50mg target recruitment 200) in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and cerebral microbleeds compared to conventional dose (100mg target recruitment 200). Patients presenting with acute (\\<3 weeks) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and microbleeds (≧1 microbleeds in SWI scans) will be randomly assigned to the secondary stroke prevention therapy of low-dose or conventional dose aspirin for 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","microbleeds","Clinical trial","Aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"low-dose aspirin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Management policy is to use 50 mg aspirin per day as a secondary prevention strategy for patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and microbleeds. 50mg aspirin is recommended by the guideline of ASA/AHA in prevention of stroke.
