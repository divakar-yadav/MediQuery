Residential rehabilitation is a direct way to observe patients' living environment and provides feasible ADL treatment plans for patients with stroke living at home or in the community. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Domiciliary care- Activities of Daily Living program on activities of daily living, motor, cognition, perception, sensory, quality of life, and depression. The eligible participants were recruited and assigned into two groups: ADL home program and control group who received traditional rehabilitation in hospital. The primary outcome measures were the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, the Frenchay Activities Index, and ADL domain of the Stroke Impact Scale. The secondary outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills-Third Edition, and the Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ADL training program.","interventionNames":["Other: Domiciliary care - Activities of Daily Living"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Receive rehabilitation program in the hospital."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Domiciliary care - Activities of Daily Living","description":"Home-based ADL training.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure","description":"The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure assesses occupational performance.
