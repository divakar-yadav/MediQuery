Upon candidate identification, EMS will contact a stroke neurologist on call using a prehospital telestroke system who will confirm inclusion criteria and will allocate the subjects to a specific intervention according to a pre-established temporal sequence. Allocation will account for 3 strata: time band (two groups of 12 hours), territory (metropolitan versus provincial area) and week day (working versus weekend day).\n\nSubjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Endovascular Procedures","Emergency Medical Services"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1401,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transfer to an Endovascular Center","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Acute stroke patients with suspected acute large vessel occlusion identified by EMS at first assistance on the field will be directly transferred to the nearest Endovascular Center bypassing the Local Stroke Center.","interventionNames":["Other: Direct transfer to an Endovascular Center"]},{"label":"Transfer to the Local Stroke Center","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Acute stroke patients with suspected acute large vessel occlusion identified by EMS at first assistance on the field will be transferred to the Local Stroke Center as done accordingly with the current stroke code protocol."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Direct transfer to an Endovascular Center","description":"Cluster randomized controlled study: allocation to active or no intervention arm will be performed accordingly to a pre-established temporal sequence","armGroupLabels":["Transfer to an Endovascular Center"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale score (shift analysis)","description":"Modified Rankin Scale score in ischemic stroke patients as evaluated through a structured telephone-based interview performed by a central assessor who is blinded to group assignment.","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality in all patients","description":"Mortality in all patients included","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Mortality in hemorrhagic stroke patients","description":"Mortality in hemorrhagic stroke patients","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Clinical deterioration requiring orotracheal intubation during transfers","description":"Orotracheal intubation during transfers","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Clinical deterioration","description":"Clinical deterioration (≥4 points on the NIHSS)","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Reperfusion therapies","description":"Proportion of patients receiving iv tPA and endovascular treatment within the first 8h from symptom onset","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Time from symptom onset to reperfusion therapies","description":"Time from symptom onset to iv tPA administration (for patients treated with iv tPA) and to groin puncture (for patients treated with endovascular).","timeFrame":"8 hours"},{"measure":"Subgroup analysis","description":"Distribution of the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days (shift analysis) in the following subgroups:\n\n* Ischemic / hemorrhagic\n* Patients eligible for iv t-PA vs. non iv t-PA eligible when attended by EMS (within time window considering transfer time to the nearest SC, no formal contraindications as recent major surgery or anticoagulation)\n* Patients treated with EVT","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Clinical benefit of direct vs. local transfer accordingly with time and distance to the Endovascular Center","description":"To analyze whether an inflection point exists with respect to time from onset to arrival at the Endovascular Center beyond which transfer to a Local-SC is beneficial or equivalent.","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Dramatic early favorable response","description":"Dramatic early favorable response as determined by an NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) of 0-2 or NIHSS improvement ≥ 8 points in ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke patients.","timeFrame":"24 (-2/+12 hours)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Suspected LVO acute stroke patients identified by a RACE scale score \\>4 at the pre-hospital setting, that is evaluated by EMS professionals when attending patients, in non-stroke ready centers or primary health centers, previous to the transfer to a stroke center.\n* Patients located in geographical areas in which the reference stroke center is a hospital not capable to offer endovascular treatment (Primary stroke Center or Telestroke Center).\n* Estimated arrival time at an EVT-SC \\<7 hours from symptom onset.
