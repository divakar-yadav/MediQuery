The study will longitudinally evaluate motor tract morphology and motor impairment/function in an attempt to develop early neuroimaging-based predictors of the development of flexion synergy and its impact on reaching and hand recovery (6 month). The study will utilize quantitative motor testing (kinematics and kinetics) to measure motor impairment and reaching and hand function. Both neuroimaging and quantitative motor testing will be conducted within 96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months-post stroke. The knowledge gained by this study will provide crucial structural and functional neuroimaging evidence that demonstrates the timeline of progressive ipsi- and contralesional motor pathway (including bulbospinal pathways) changes and the associated development of flexion synergy that grossly impacts reaching and hand function in individuals with moderate to severe stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Individuals with stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in fractional anisotropy","description":"Fractional anisotropy is a quantitative measure of fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in the corticofugal, corticoreticulospinal, and corticorubrospinal tracts derived from the diffusion tensor imaging dataset.","timeFrame":"Change in fractional anisotropy will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in complexity","description":"Complexity (alpha) is an index of the non-Gaussian diffusion dynamics within the corticofugal, corticoreticulospinal, and corticorubrospinal tracts derived from the diffusion tensor imaging dataset.","timeFrame":"Change in complexity will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in mean diffusivity","description":"Mean diffusivity is a measure of neural tract integrity quantifying the rotationally invariant magnitude of water diffusion within neural tissue defined by the 3-dimensional diffusion tensor.","timeFrame":"Change in mean diffusivity will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in radial diffusivity","description":"Radial diffusivity is a measure of neural membrane integrity quantifying the average of the two small-axis values of water diffusion within neural tissue defined by the 3-dimensional diffusion tensor.","timeFrame":"Change in radial diffusivity will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in axial diffusivity","description":"Axial diffusivity is a measure of neural tract direction quantifying the long-axis value of water diffusion within neural tissue defined by the 3-dimensional diffusion tensor.","timeFrame":"Change in axial diffusivity will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in maximum reaching distance","description":"Quantitative evaluation of reaching accounting for the expression of both flexion synergy and weakness by calculating distance from reaching kinematics data during ballistic outward reaches against various abduction loads.","timeFrame":"Change in maximum reaching distance will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in maximum hand aperture","description":"Quantitative evaluation of hand opening accounting for the expression of both flexion synergy and weakness by calculating the area of a pentagon formed by the finger tips from hand kinematics data obtained at various abduction loads.","timeFrame":"Change in maximum hand aperture will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Change in maximum grasp force","description":"Quantitative evaluation of hand closing accounting for the expression of both flexion synergy and weakness by calculating the mean surface grasp force of the hand at various abduction loads.","timeFrame":"Change in maximum grasp force will be modeled over 4 time points (48-96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months post-stroke)."},{"measure":"Predictive capacity of diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) for 6-month reaching and hand performance","description":"Changes in structural morphology measured acutely will be evaluated as early predictors for chronic reaching and hand performance.
