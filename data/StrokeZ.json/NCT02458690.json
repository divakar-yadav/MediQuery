Participants will be primary care patients who are depressed but do not have a history of CVD. Half of the participants will receive standard depression treatment in primary care (usual care), and the other half will receive one year of eIMPACT, a collaborative stepped care program including antidepressants and computerized and telephonic cognitive-behavioral therapy. To evaluate change in CVD risk, the investigators will measure artery function using ultrasound before and after the 1-year treatment period. It is hypothesized that patients who receive the eIMPACT intervention will have greater improvements in artery function than patients who receive usual care.","detailedDescription":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of American men and women, and its economic burden is substantial and on the rise. Adults with depression are at elevated risk of CVD events and poor CVD prognosis. Unfortunately, past trials of depression treatments have not observed the anticipated cardiovascular benefits. A novel explanation for these null results is that the interventions in these trials, which all involved patients with preexisting CVD, were delivered too late in the natural history of CVD. To begin to evaluate our hypothesis that treating depression before clinical CVD onset could reduce CVD risk, the investigators are conducting a phase II randomized controlled trial of 216 primary care patients aged ≥ 50 years with a depressive disorder and CVD risk factors but no clinical CVD. Patients will be randomized to one year of eIMPACT, our modernized IMPACT intervention, or usual primary care for depression. eIMPACT is a collaborative stepped care intervention involving a multidisciplinary team delivering evidenced-based depression treatments consistent with patient preference. The investigator shave modernized our intervention by incorporating computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy and delivering other treatment components via telephone. Our central hypothesis is that eIMPACT will improve endothelial dysfunction, which is considered a barometer of CVD risk, in depressed adults by decreasing depressive symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and platelet activation. The investigators will test our central hypothesis by carrying out these specific aims: (1) to determine whether eIMPACT reduces the excess CVD risk of depressed patients (primary outcome: endothelial dysfunction; exploratory outcome: incident CVD events) and (2) to examine candidate mechanisms underlying the effect of eIMPACT on CVD risk (secondary outcomes: depressive symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and platelet activation). A positive trial would generate the mechanistic rationale, efficacy evidence, and effect size estimates needed to justify and design a multisite, event-driven, phase III trial to confirm eIMPACT's efficacy in reducing CVD risk. Demonstrating that depression treatment reduces CVD risk, the primary expected outcome of this line of research, would have a substantial positive impact. It would identify a novel target (depression) for CVD prevention efforts, and it would equip providers with a new disseminable and scalable tool (eIMPACT) to simultaneously treat depression and manage the CVD risk of a large cohort of high-risk patients. Collectively, these changes to clinical practice should translate into reduced CVD morbidity, mortality, and costs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression","Major Depressive Disorder","Dysthymic Disorder","Depressive Symptoms","Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Coronary Artery Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["Primary Care","Older Adults","Computerized and Telephonic Psychotherapy","Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy","Antidepressant Medications"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":216,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"eIMPACT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"eIMPACT is a 12-month, modernized, collaborative, stepped care intervention consisting of (1) computerized and telephonic cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression and (2) select antidepressant medications included in an algorithm optimized for cardiovascular disease risk reduction.
