Mechanical thrombolysis is possible also without the use of rt-PA. The procedural choices of the interventional neuroradiologist depend on the type of occlusion, circumstances and experience.\n\nThe study is designed to detect or disprove (alpha=5% and power probability=80%) a 15% absolute difference between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients with a favourable outcome (Modified Rankin Scale Score = 0-1).Enrollment will be completed with 350 randomized patients.\n\nNeurological deficit will be scored with NIH Stroke Scale at day 7 or discharge, or transfer to another hospital, whichever occurs first.Patient's clinical condition will be again evaluated by a telephone call after 90 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Acute ischemic stroke","thrombolysis","intra-arterial thrombolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":350,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IA thrombolysis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"IA recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and/or mechanical thrombolysis","interventionNames":["Other: Alteplase IA and/or mechanical thrombolysis"]},{"label":"IV rtPA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase IV"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Alteplase IA and/or mechanical thrombolysis","description":"loca intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and/or mechanical thrombolysis","armGroupLabels":["IA thrombolysis"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase IV","description":"intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator","armGroupLabels":["IV rtPA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To assess whether IA thrombolysis, as compared to IV rt-PA, increases survival free of disability (modified Rankin score of zero or 1) at 3 months.","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To asses whether IA thrombolysis vs.IV rt-PA 1.improves the 7 day neurological deficit; 2.is safe on the base of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, fatal and non-fatal stroke, death from any cause, neurological deterioration within 7 days","timeFrame":"7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Sudden focal neurological deficit attributable to a stroke\n* Clearly defined time of onset, allowing initiation of intravenous treatment within 3 hours of symptoms onset and intra-arterial treatment within 6 hour of symptoms onset.\n* Age greater than 18 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Disability preceding stroke consistent with a modified Rankin scale score of 2-4\n* Coma at onset\n* Rapidly improving neurological deficit\n* Seizure at onset\n* Clinical presentation suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage\n* Previous history of intracranial hemorrhage\n* Septic embolism\n* Arterial puncture at a non compressible site within the previous 7 days\n* Any traumatic brain injury within the previous 14 days\n* Surgery of the central nervous system in the previous 3 months\n* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or urinary tract hemorrhage within the previous 14 days.\n* Current therapy with intravenous or subcutaneous heparin to rise the clotting time\n* Known hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis, baseline INR greater than 1.5, aPTT more than 1.5 times normal, or baseline platelet count less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter\n* Baseline blood glucose concentrations below 2.75 mm/L (50 mg/dL).\n* Known contrast sensitivity.\n* Women of childbearing potential (unless pregnancy impossible) or known to be breastfeeding.
