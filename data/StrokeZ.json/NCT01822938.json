It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life and to a decrease in the current treatment side-effects and mortality. Stroke in association with an inactive lifestyle lead to a decrease in physical capability and causes problems in daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall simultaneously leading to vicious circle of less and less mobility. Therefore, physical activity for the health is a valid and relevant way to improve the quality of life and to recover functional capacity. The aim of the study is the assessment of the effects of a incentive program for physical activity on people following/with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"effects of a incentive program for physical activity","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The aim of the study is the assessment of the effects of a incentive program for physical activity on people following/with stroke","interventionNames":["Other: incentive program for physical activity"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No intervention"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"incentive program for physical activity","armGroupLabels":["effects of a incentive program for physical activity"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The distance on the 6 minute walking test (6MWT)","timeFrame":"6 minutes"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quality of life","description":"EQ-5D","timeFrame":"at 0 month, 6 months and 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Person having stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)\n* Whatever the area of stroke\n* Person supported by HEMIPASS (monitoring team and home support)\n* Stroke less than 6 months\n* Patient walking with or without technical or human assistance: FCC score\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Disability limiting the gait before the stroke\n* Age \\< 18 years\n* Cognitive impairment limiting participation to the program\n* Non signature of the consent\n* cardiopulmonary pathology which forbid/banned effort","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital, Limoges","city":"Limoges","zip":"87 042","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.83153,"lon":1.25781}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35502452","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Guediri A, Chaparro D, Borel B, Daviet JC, Compagnat M, Mandigout S.
