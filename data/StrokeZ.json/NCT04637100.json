This is a randomized-controlled trial with the intervention arm consisting of puzzle gaming applications and the control arm consisting of stroke-relevant educational videos provided and encouraged throughout the course of participants' acute inpatient rehabilitation stay.","detailedDescription":"Study subjects will be randomized to a control or experimental group and allocation will be concealed. The experimental group will consist of the subject utilizing their personal mobile or tablet device to play a pre-selected set of problem-solving games for a goal of 1 hour daily. The control group will utilize their personal mobile or tablet device to perform the non-problem-solving task of watching educational videos of their choice from a pre-selected set of videos for the same amount of time daily. The intervention gaming arm will be provided different gaming apps if they lose interest or find a particular game too easy or too difficult. The control video arm will be provided different educational videos according to their needs that may change throughout their inpatient stay."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cognitive Impairment","Executive Dysfunction","Cognitive Change","Cognitive Deficit"],"keywords":["Stroke","cerebrovascular accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patient will utilize their personal mobile or tablet device to play a pre-selected set of problem-solving games for a goal of 1 hour daily for the duration of their inpatient rehabilitation stay (approximately 3 weeks).","interventionNames":["Other: Mobile or tablet-based gaming applications"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The patient will utilize their personal mobile or tablet device to watch a pre-selected set of stroke-related educational videos for a goal of 1 hour daily for the duration of their inpatient rehabilitation stay (approximately 3 weeks).","interventionNames":["Other: Stroke-related educational videos"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mobile or tablet-based gaming applications","description":"Subject will use their own personal smartphone or tablet device to play from a collection of pre-selected gaming applications.
