There are 8 domains: strength, hand function, mobility, physical and instrumental activities of daily living, memory and thinking, communication, emotion, and social participation. Each item is rated using a 5-point Likert scale. The patient rates his/her difficulty completing each item, where: 1 = an inability to complete the item, 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. An extra question on stroke recovery asks that the client rate on a scale from 0 - 100 how much the client feels that he/she has recovered from his/her stroke. Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100; 0 = no recovery, 100 = full recovery. and higher scores indicate a better HRQoL. will use two-way repeated-measures ANOVA statistics for data analysis.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Compare Mean differences of self-care behavior on stroke patient.","description":"Each participant was asked using by self-care behavior questionnaire (Thai version) develop by Kasama Chiangtong (2011) is a 15-item self-report assessment of self-care behavior.
