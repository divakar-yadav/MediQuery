Each session will involve use of a Virtual Reality (VR) system to deliver an immersive environment to encourage movement of the arm. The system also relies on 6 body-worn sensors that will detect movements of participant's arms and trunk. VR use will encompass 30-minutes of the therapy session, the remainder of the session will involve working with the therapist in addressing the functional tasks that are most meaningful for the participant and that involve the upper extremities.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual reality (VR) therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in hemiplegic arm movements","description":"Arm movements will be measured using wrist-worn accelerometers.
