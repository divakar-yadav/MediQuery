The purpose of this Registry is to assess the procedural success and clinical outcomes associated with various operator techniques for mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusions (LVO) in the anterior circulation. Data will be collected on the use of Stryker market-released neurovascular mechanical access and mechanical thrombectomy devices that are commercially available or that may be approved for commercial use during the conduct of the Registry. This Registry will also collect data, including time-to-treatment and quality of life measures, to allow for subset analyses."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
