All subjects presented rigorous neuroimaging evidence, including head computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, which underwent review by two or more experienced neuroradiologists. Adverse outcomes were characterized as compliant endpoint events, encompassing mortality and recurrences. The primary outcome was adverse outcomes and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival (RFS).","detailedDescription":"Clinical data for the derivation cohort were acquired from three medical facilities: Tongji Hospital Sino-French New City Branch in Caidian District, Tongji Hospital Qiaokou Branch in Hankou District, and Tongji Hospital Optics Valley Branch in Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone. The clinical data were sourced from the electronic medical records of Tongji Hospital, the largest healthcare facility in the Hubei region of China. Its comprehensive electronic medical record system comprises over 60 million medical records spanning from 1980 to the present. We retrospectively gathered information on patients admitted for acute first-ever ischaemic stroke between January 2012 and January 2022. The following individuals were excluded from the study: 1) Those under 18 years of age; and 2) Pregnant women.\n\nThe variables gathered included the primary test parameters of patients within 24 hours of admission, encompassing age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption status, arterial blood pressure, fat-related indicators, comorbidities, and the primary treatments administered within the initial 24 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["stroke","Fat","Obesity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45162,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke","description":"We retrospectively gathered information on patients admitted for acute first-ever ischaemic stroke between January 2012 and January 2022.
