This condition can be life threatening because these ventricles are the main pumping chambers of the heart. The fast heartbeat is caused by electrical impulses that travel incorrectly in your heart.\n\nOne way to treat VT is to have a catheter ablation procedure. A catheter ablation is a procedure that creates scar tissue in the heart to interrupt the electrical impulses that create irregular heart rhythms.\n\nIt is possible that the ablation procedure might cause a blood clot to form. The blood clot can stop blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke. When blood flow is interrupted to a certain part of the brain, that part does not receive enough oxygen. As a result of the stroke the affected areas of the brain are unable to function normally.\n\nDirect oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is a blood thinning drug, also called an anticoagulant. It interferes with the body's natural blood clotting ability by inactivating a specific enzyme that the body needs to form blood clots.\n\nParticipation in this study will last about 30 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ventricular Tachycardia","Premature Ventricular Contraction","Stroke"],"keywords":["Radiofrequency ablation","anticoagulation","Direct oral anticoagulants","Aspirin","Ventricular arrhythmia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":246,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DOAC (Direct Oral Anticoagulant)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be asked to take standard dose approved for stroke prophylaxis","interventionNames":["Drug: DOAC"]},{"label":"Aspirin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be asked to take 81 milligrams by mouth once per day.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"DOAC","description":"DOAC is a blood thinning drug, also called direct oral anticoagulant.
