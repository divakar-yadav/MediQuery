Participants will be assigned to the treatment groups by chance and neither the participants nor the research staff who interact with them will know the allocation.\n\nThe following 4 to 5 treatment cycles will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with NT 201 (botulinum toxin) when administered in doses between 400 and 800 Units (Open Label Extension Period).
