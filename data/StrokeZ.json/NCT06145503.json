However, it can also strike young people and even children and ranks as the second leading cause of non-traumatic disability and cognitive impairment among adults. Stroke can lead to a range of physical, sensory, and cognitive deficits and impairments in psychosocial functioning. One of the most significant challenges faced by stroke survivors is cognitive impairment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment following a stroke varies widely, ranging from 20% to 80%, and it is influenced by factors such as geographical location, ethnicity, and diagnostic criteria. Stroke can disrupt various cognitive functions, including information processing, memory, planning, problem-solving, spatial awareness, apraxia, motor control, spatial perception, confusion, denial (anosognosia), and object recognition issues (agnosia). The literature reports that 30% of stroke patients experience functional limitations related to balance, speech, and cognitive issues. Particularly, more than half of stroke patients over the age of 65 experience hemiparesis, and around 30% require assistance for walking. Chronic stroke can also lead to balance and mobility problems, affecting daily life activities and significantly impacting the patient's overall quality of life.\n\nThere is a growing need for improvements in the post-stroke experience and long-term care for stroke patients. In this context, rehabilitation interventions play a vital role. Rehabilitation interventions aim to prevent complications, reduce neurological deficits, maximize functional capacity, and ultimately promote personal autonomy and social integration. Dance intervention, as part of the rehabilitation process, is recognized as an effective approach to addressing chronic stroke-related motor disorders, positively impacting post-stroke health, and promoting socialization. Dance, characterized by rhythmic body movements to music, serves as a form of artistic or emotional expression and can be performed individually, in pairs, or in groups. It is a multifaceted activity that engages both physical and cognitive abilities. Dance has been found to have positive effects on emotions, sensory stimulation, motor coordination, social interaction, perception, executive functions, and memory. Literature suggests that dance intervention helps to improve both the physical and cognitive impairments of stroke patients through promoting interpersonal harmony and multiple stimulations, and therefore its use is recommended to enhance the cognitive and physical functions of chronic stroke patients. In light of this information, this single-blind, randomized, controlled study aims to investigate the impact of dance intervention on cognitive functions and quality of life among chronic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Impairment","Stroke","Quality of Life"],"keywords":["Cognitive impairment","Dance","Stroke","Quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The sample size was determined as 36 chronic stroke patients in total (18 for each group) for the two groups (dance intervention group, control group) with an effect size of 1,000 and a targeted test power of 0.90 (90%) in the G\\*Power 3.1.9.6 program with an error of α=0.05 and a reference to a previous study on the subject.
