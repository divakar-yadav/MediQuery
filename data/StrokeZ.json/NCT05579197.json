The disability derived from a stroke can imply reduced communication and limited activities of daily living in the long term. Specifically, reduced mobility and equilibrium, walking asymmetry and spasticity of the impaired limb are the principal factors related to long-term limited physical activity and moderate dependency of the patient on the caregiver \\[2,3\\]. A walking deficit can have severe consequences on the energetic cost and the risk of falling, as well as on the participation and personal identity of the person \\[4\\].\n\nMoreover, another psychological area that can be affected is self-efficacy, defined as the individual capabilities to take actions for obtaining results. Hence, for a person affected by stroke, self-efficacy is crucial and connected to his/her adaptation to the new condition \\[5\\].\n\nFor these reasons, walking rehabilitation is essential to recover lower limbs' function, restore self-efficacy and re-establish the social participation of patients \\[6\\].\n\nRobotics has been demonstrated in being a suitable and effective tool in order to assist and treat post-stroke patients \\[7\\], thanks to its capability to deliver intensive and task-oriented training. One of the most common modalities to classify robotics devices is according to their structure, and the modality to interface with the patients. In these regards, we can distinguish between exoskeletons and end-effector robots, given their characteristics to wear the patient and guide him/her through the distal handle of the mechanical chain, respectively. Moreover, among the exoskeletons, the exosuits are a sub-group of robotics devices designed in lighter materials and that assist the patients by actively moving the hip, knee or ankle.\n\nThe lightweight of exosuits makes them suitable both for ecological and therapy-related settings, as well as assistance applications. It is also worth noticing that the absence of a rigid structure requires the patients to have an active component in the walking activity. Previous studies highlighted how these devices can have a supportive capacity during the propulsion phases of gait, assisting the patients throughout the walk \\[8\\].\n\nThe Myosuit device is a wearable exosuit capable to provide assistance during the walk, sit to stand transition and stair climb \\[9\\]. Its assistance is provided with an exo-tendon mechanism. More in detail, online analysis of inertial signals allows to segment the gait phases and to assist at the extension of the knee and hip \\[9\\].\n\nMany previous studies show promising results in the deambulation of spinal cord injuries or patients with lower-limb disorders \\[9,10\\]. These results were evaluated both in terms of kinematics and the safety of the patients. However, the studies conducted to highlight the urgency for the validation of the device in bigger and different cohorts \\[9,10\\].\n\nGiven this framework, the aim of this work is to conduct a pilot study on the effects of a lower-limb exosuit, the Myosuit device, on post-stroke patients. The effects of the device will be analysed in terms of usability of the device, self-efficacy, and functional parameters of gait."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Haemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","robotics","exosuit","lower-limbs","rehabilitation","assistance","usability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lower limbs robotic intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention administered in this arm is a lower limb robotic intervention using the device Myosuit.
