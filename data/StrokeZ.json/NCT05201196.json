Patient will be recruited that meet the inclusion criteria, with unilateral hemiplegia referred by Neurophysician having stroke for the first time, between age 47-70 year, both males and females, score of spasticity for upper extremity (shoulder, elbow) below and equal 2 based on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), ability to comprehend simple instructions (Mini-Mental State Examination with a minimum score \\> 24), Brunnstrom stages ≥ 4, not submitted to other upper-limb rehabilitation programs during the participation in this study. The individuals with recurrent stroke episodes and transient ischemic attack, other neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,), hemineglect, no sitting balance and comorbidities are excluded. Outcome measures used are FuglMeyer assessment scale (wrist and hand) and Wolf motor function test for upper extremity while Barthel index to assess the activities of daily living. All procedures will perform by taking informed consent. All Ethical standards for both patient and institution will be followed. After collecting data, will apply Shapiro Wilk test to check the normal distribution of data. For analysis use SPSS version 25"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Task","Training","Movement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional physical therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional physical therapy Muscle strengthening and Muscle Stretching, TENS.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physical therapy"]},{"label":"Task Oriented Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental group was given Task Oriented protocol including different task specific functional activities","interventionNames":["Other: Task Oriented Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional physical therapy","description":"Targeted muscle stretching and Strengthening (flexors, Extensors, abductors, internal and external rotators, of Shoulder, Elbow, forearm (supination \\& pronation) and hand 10 repetitions×1 set, 4 days/ week.
