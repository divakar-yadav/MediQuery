Using a RCT design/Intervention Efficacy paradigm, Aim 1 will investigate the independent and combined (paired) contributions of intensity and variability of stepping training on locomotor function, with secondary measures of health and community mobility. For Aim 2, we will evaluate the independent and combined effects of intensity and variability of stepping training on non-walking LE tasks. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the cost effectiveness of providing these interventions to accelerate motor recovery and health. Our central hypothesis is that results of this study will provide a theoretical foundation for implementation of physical therapy interventions which can facilitate short-term gains in locomotor function, and contribute to long-term improvements in health, function and participation through increased community mobility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["locomotion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"3 arm RCT - high intensity variable, high intensity forward, low intensity variable","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Variable high-intensity Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"high intensity variable stepping exercise on a treadmill and overground","interventionNames":["Behavioral: exercise"]},{"label":"Variable low-intensity training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"low intensity variable stepping exercise on a treadmill and overground","interventionNames":["Behavioral: exercise"]},{"label":"Constant High Intensity Training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"high intensity constant (forward) stepping exercise on a treadmill and overground","interventionNames":["Behavioral: exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"exercise","description":"Variable conditions of stepping practice","armGroupLabels":["Constant High Intensity Training","Variable high-intensity Training","Variable low-intensity training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in peak walking speed","description":"fastest comfortable walking speed overground","timeFrame":"At baseline, following 8 weeks of training and a 2 month follow-up"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Functional Gait Assessment","description":"dynamic balance activities","timeFrame":"At baseline, following 8 weeks of training and a 2 month follow-up"},{"measure":"Change in 5X sit-to-stand transfer time","description":"non-walking functional mobility task","timeFrame":"At baseline, following 8 weeks of training and a 2 month follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* history unilateral stroke \\> 6 months duration\n* walks without physical assistance at speeds \\< 1.0 m/s\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* no other cardiopulmonary, metabolic, neurological orthopedic injury that may contribute to walking outcomes","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thomas Hornby, PT, PhD","affiliation":"RIC/NU","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60611","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34695300","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Clark B, Whitall J, Kwakkel G, Mehrholz J, Ewings S, Burridge J.
