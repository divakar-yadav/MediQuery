It is well known that sleep has an impact on brain plasticity, and after an ischemic stroke, studies have shown subjective sleep quality alterations and sleep architecture abnormalities.\n\nFurthermore, there is no clear guideline showing the usefulness of a systematic sleep investigation following an ischemic stroke.\n\nThe aim of the study is to identify retrospectively correlation between polysomnographic abnormalities (sleep apnea, periodic limb movements, disturbed sleep architecture...) and functional recovery after an ischemic stroke. The study also assesses the impact of sleep abnormalities on survival, and the risk of new cardiovascular event.","detailedDescription":"This study is a retrospective observational study, from a cohort of patients who had a sleep recording (polysomnography or ventilatory polygraphy performed in Montpellier University Hospital) following an ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Cerebral Infarct","Sleep Apnea","Periodic Limb Movement Disorder"],"keywords":["Functional recovery","Ischemic stroke / cerebral
