This can be fatal or can result in permanent disability. A fast diagnosis is essential to initiate effective interventions and optimize benefits to patients. There are other diseases that can look like a stroke and these are called \"stroke mimics\". The quicker that stroke mimics can be ruled out the faster a stroke can be diagnosed and treatment can be given. The investigators may be able to use chemicals in the blood to rapidly confirm that a person has had a stroke. One such chemical is called eotaxin. Eotaxin has been found to be changed in sufferers of a stroke but not in those with stroke mimics. However, more research is needed to confirm the usefulness of eotaxin. This feasibility study aims to provide the foundations to allow a large scale trial of this test. The study aims to recruit participants that have had a stroke or a stroke mimic from the Acute Stroke Unit and Stroke clinic at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. Up to 6 blood samples will be taken from each participant at different times over one week. Eotaxin will be measured in these samples and in participant's leftover samples taken for clinical care. This is needed because the investigators know that the amount of eotaxin changes in the blood after a stroke but we do not know how quickly this change happens and for how long the change occurs. The study will also allow the investigators to understand how many participants will be needed for a large scale trial and the challenges that may be faced in recruiting participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Symptom Participants"},{"label":"Healthy Controls"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary Outcome","description":"Plasma Eotaxin Concentration","timeFrame":"0 to 7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presenting with focal neurological symptoms suggestive of stroke\n* Aged over 18 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presenting later than 12 hours after symptom onset\n* Under 18 years of age\n* History of cardiovascular disease (Healthy Controls)\n* History of neurological disease (Healthy Controls)\n* History of stroke mimics (Healthy Controls)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Individuals presenting to hospital with focal neurological symptoms suggestive of stroke aged over 18 years.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Salim Elyas, PhD MRCP","affiliation":"Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust","city":"Exeter","state":"Devon","zip":"EX2 5DW","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":50.7236,"lon":-3.52751}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
