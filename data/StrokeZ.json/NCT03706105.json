Stroke survivors will be recruited through hospital system providers and physical therapists (PTs) for entry into a multidisciplinary, three-month cardiac rehabilitation program. This program consists of three sessions per week of supervised cardiovascular endurance and strength training, stretching, relaxation and education. Participants will be stroke survivors, have completed formal physical and occupational rehabilitation (if applicable), and have treating provider approval."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention - Cardiac Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Cardiac Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Cardiac Rehabilitation","description":"3 x week \\~1 hour of exercise + education","armGroupLabels":["Intervention - Cardiac Rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6-minute walk Test","description":"Aerobic and Walking Capacity Measure","timeFrame":"Change in 6-minute walk test at 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Walking Speed","description":"Self-Selected walking speed for 10 meters","timeFrame":"Change in Walking Speed at 3 months"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go","description":"Mobility Measure: timed movement from seated in a chair, walk 10 feet and return to sitting in a chair.","timeFrame":"Change in timed up and go at 3 months"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","description":"Quality of Life Questionnaire evaluating difficulty after stroke in 8 domains: strength, hand function, activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion, memory/thinking, participation/role function.
