GNPT consists of a set of computerized cognitive exercises covering different cognitive functions and subfunctions. Every task has been specifically based on cognitive paradigms to address specific cognitive subfunction. The rehabilitation process starts by assigning a patient to a therapist responsible for the treatment. The therapist has then to perform the initial neuropsychological assessment, consisting of a set of validated tests used to attention, memory and executive functions prior to the treatment. The results of these tests will be stored in GNPT system. Then, the cognitive profile is calculated using these results, and taking into account the patient's age and study level. Using this profile, the program assigns a set of computerized tasks to a certain day, configuring the input parameters of each task in order to personalize treatments.","armGroupLabels":["Guttmann, NeuroPersonalTrainer"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ictus.online","description":"An online domain which provides a daily session of one hour of duration.
