Here, the word 'somatosensory' refers to bodily sensations associated with proprioception or kinesthesia, not the sensation of touch, pain, and temperature. The study focuses on upper limb retraining for community-dwelling stroke survivors using a robotic device. At the end of training, both movement accuracy and somatosensory acuity in chronic stroke survivors are presumed to improve, and such paradigm is expected to provide reliable benefits as compared to conventional intervention alone.","detailedDescription":"Long-term disability is common sequela among people with stroke. On top of motor impairment, many stroke survivors suffer from somatosensory impairment of their paretic arm, leading to their inability to perform activities of daily living using upper limb. In this respect, recent research on motor recovery following stroke has begun to place more emphasis on the inclusion of somatosensory retraining in stroke rehabilitation program. Although evidence is still scarce, training paradigms that simultaneously combine both somatosensory and motor aspects are considered useful for motor recovery in stroke survivors. Principally, studies focusing on such form of training paradigm sought to employ robotic technologies to assist in the retraining of both motor and somatosensory function in stroke survivors. Robotic technologies have gained popularity recently for assessing somatosensory function in clinical setting due to its objective quantification of patients' performance and high inter-rater reliability. Thus, with the purpose of improving both motor and somatosensory functions in chronic stroke survivors, this proposed study will provide an intensive robotic-based behavioral training intervention to chronic stroke survivors from the community. The intervention will require active participation of the patients through an exploratory strategy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Somatosensory","Proprioception","Kinesthesia","Rehabilitation robotics","Positive reinforcement","Upper limb retraining"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active somatosensory training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Chronic stroke patients will be randomized to receive 15 sessions of robotic-based training intervention that focuses on the retraining of both motor and somatosensory functions, for a maximum of one hour per session.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Active somatosensory training"]},{"label":"Motor-based training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Chronic stroke patients will be randomized to receive 15 sessions of robotic-based training intervention that is purely motor based, for a maximum of one hour per session.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motor-based training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Active somatosensory training","description":"Patients in the experimental group will be required to move the robotic handle using their paretic arm from the start position to a visual target shown on screen.
