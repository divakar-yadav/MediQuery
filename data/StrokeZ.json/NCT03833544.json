It is hypothesized that there would be significant improvements in gait and strength of the flexor muscles as a result of the training. It is also hypothesized that the training effects, if any, would be retained at 4 weeks after ending the training.","detailedDescription":"It is known that the muscles that flex the hip, knee, and ankle joints are responsible for bringing the leg up and forward during walking and for a successful recovery from a slip or trip. Many previous studies have focused on strengthening the lower limb muscles that support the body in standing and walking (the so-called anti-gravity extensor muscles) but the training targeting the lower limb flexors has rarely been emphasized in stroke rehabilitation. Therefore, it is the intent of this exploratory study to find out whether an exercise training program focusing on lower limb flexors can improve lower limb motor function late after stroke.\n\nTen participants with chronic stroke will be recruited. Their lower limb muscle function and walking performance will be assessed at baseline (2 to 3 times within the 2 weeks prior to starting the training), at the end of training, and 4 weeks later.\n\nEach subject will perform biking exercises under supervision, 2-3 times per week for 4 weeks (30 minutes each). The bike pedals are moving backward at a preset speed regardless of user effort. With feet strapped to the pedals, the participant will be asked to activate the hip, knee, and ankle flexors simultaneously when the pedal is moving up and then relax. Heart rate (HR) will be monitored continuously using a fingertip pulse monitor to ensure the maximum training HR is no more than 75% of the subject's HR Reserve."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise training: Progressive resistance training of hip, knee, and ankle flexors.","interventionNames":["Other: Exercise training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exercise training","description":"Progressive resistance training of hip, knee, and ankle flexors.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in Speed During Overground Gait","description":"To test if the training can improve gait speed during overground walking, gait speeds will be obtained using a video-based 3D motion capture system before and after the training.
