The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Buqitongluo Granule will improve the syndrome score of Qi Deficiency and Blood Stasis in convalescence of ischemic stroke, stable angina pectoris of coronary artery disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome. Buqitongluo Granule will be compared to placebo, combined with guidelines-based standard care in patients.
