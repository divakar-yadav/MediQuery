Moreover, the respiratory muscles may also be affected. The worsening of the respiratory function is weakened and lung function declines, leading to dysfunction of expectoration and swallowing, and increasing the incidence of pneumonia after stroke. In addition, it will also lead to a decline in activity ability, which in turn affects the quality of life. The respiratory muscle training may improve the respiratory recovery and prevent pulmonary complication."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Stroke","Respiratory muscle training","Respiratory function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":144,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dofin Breathing Strength Builder","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Usual post stroke care and respiratory muscle training","interventionNames":["Device: Dofin Breathing Strength Builder"]},{"label":"Usual post stroke care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual post stroke care"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Dofin Breathing Strength Builder","description":"If the patient's condition is stable, respiratory muscle training will be performed under Dofin Breathing Strength Builder 7 days after stroke.
