All subjects should have sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions as well as understand the content and purpose of the experiment, and also should be able to sit up for 1 hour.\n\nDuring the training, you will be asked to do the hand open and hand grasp by Electromyography-driven robotic control strategy.\n\nThere will be evaluations on the upper limb motor functions before and after the 20-session of training and follow up session by clinical assessments on functional recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hand","Upper Extremity","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hand Robotic Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hand Robotic Training","interventionNames":["Device: Hand Robotic Training"]},{"label":"Hand and Arm Robotic Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Hand and Arm Robotic Training","interventionNames":["Device: Hand and Arm Robotic Training"]},{"label":"Conventional therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional therapy","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hand Robotic Training","description":"Training for 20 sessions for one hour, 3-5 times per week.","armGroupLabels":["Hand Robotic Training"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hand and Arm Robotic Training","description":"Training for 20 sessions for one hour, 3-5 times per week.","armGroupLabels":["Hand and Arm Robotic Training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional therapy","description":"Training for 20 sessions for one hour, 3-5 times per week.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Evaluate the change from baseline assessment at the end of intervention and monitor the continuous change at three months and six months.\n\nBaseline assessment will be conducted at within one week prior to intervention.
