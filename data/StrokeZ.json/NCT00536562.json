Two hundred consecutive patients from Stroke Prevention Clinics (SPC) at London Health Sciences Centre and the Ottawa Hospital (100 patients from each site) who have sustained a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or mild non-disabling stroke will participate in a randomized controlled trial in which they will either receive Usual Care (UC) as delivered by the SPC, or enter the existing multi-disciplinary 6-month comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) intervention at LHSC and Ottawa in addition to receiving UC.
