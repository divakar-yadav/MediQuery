There are numerous rehabilitation methods to stimulate recovery, amongst which mirror therapy (MT). It is particularly interesting in cases for which impairment is severe, as many other forms of therapy are often impossible.\n\nDuring MT, a mirror is placed in the midsagittal plane, so as to hide the impaired limb. Thereafter, the subject is asked to move his unimpaired limb while looking at its reflection in the mirror, thereby creating the illusion that the contralateral, impaired limb is moving.\n\nThe objective of this study is to better determine the efficacy of MT. The investigators will therefore compare recovery of arm function in two groups of patient, that perform a regimen of 30 minutes of therapy, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks on top of conventional therapy. One group performs MT and the other one performs a therapy in which the same movements are performed, but without the use of a mirror, with unrestricted view of both limbs. Allocation to each group will be randomized. Arm function will be evaluated by use of a scale before, during and after the 4 week period. The assessor for the primary outcome measure will not know in which group the patient is. There will be a total of 30 patients included over a one year study period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","mirror therapy","neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mirror Therapy (MT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Standard therapy + 30 min/day of mirror therapy, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks, administered by experienced physical and occupational therapists.","interventionNames":["Other: Mirror Therapy"]},{"label":"Control Therapy (CT)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard therapy + 30 min/day of CT.","interventionNames":["Other: Control Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Mirror Therapy","description":"Mirror therapy will consist in placing a large mirror in the sagittal plane of the subject so as to reflect his healthy arm while hiding the paretic one, and then asking him to perform movements of his healthy arm while looking at its reflection in the mirror.","armGroupLabels":["Mirror Therapy (MT)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control Therapy","description":"Performance of the same movements as the experimental group without the mirror or instructions as to where to look, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Control Therapy (CT)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl Meyer Assessment - Upper Limb (FMA-UE)","description":"Change in Fugl Meyer Assessment - Upper Limb (FMA-UE) at different time points: before, during, after intervention and after a 6 week follow-up.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after start of therapy.
