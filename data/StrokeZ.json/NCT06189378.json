Outcomes include adherence and patient-reported outcomes.","detailedDescription":"In this prospective trial, the investigators randomized persons with diagnoses of stroke or transitoric ischemic attack into two groups: (i) 10 patients received a personalized blood pressure diary with pictures of their choosing. (ii) 10 patients received a blood pressure diary without photographs. The investigators instructed participants in either group to document their blood pressure at home twice daily over twenty-eight days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurovascular Disorder"],"keywords":["adherence","blood pressure diary","stroke","TIA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional blood pressure diary","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Blood pressure diaries consisted of tables including columns for date, time as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively (1 page for 1 week) printed on the right-hand pages of an A5 (ISO 216 format) booklet.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional blood pressure diary"]},{"label":"Blood pressure diary including patient-provided pictures","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the interventional arm pictures chosen by patients were provided over a secure online connection by patients in this group and inserted into the left-hand-pages of the blood pressure diaries.","interventionNames":["Other: Inclusion of patient-provided pictures into blood pressure diaries"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Inclusion of patient-provided pictures into blood pressure diaries","description":"Patient-provided pictures with positive meaning were included into blood pressure diaries","armGroupLabels":["Blood pressure diary including patient-provided pictures"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional blood pressure diary","description":"Conventional blood pressure diary","armGroupLabels":["Conventional blood pressure diary"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adherence","description":"The primary endpoint was adherence to blood pressure diaries defined as the number of complete blood pressure measurements (maximum of two per day) divided by the maximum number of measures over the study period (28 days, resulting in a maximum total of 56 measurements).
