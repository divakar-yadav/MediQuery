We hypothesize that CNTF delivery to the human eye will provide neuroprotection (prevent loss of vision) and neuroenhancement (improve vision indices) in ischemic optic neuropathy. Patients in the trial will receive an NT-501 CNTF implant (made by Neurotech) into one eye, and will be carefully followed to evaluate safety and efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Optic Neuropathy/Optic Nerve Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NT-501 CNTF Implant","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive single NT-501 CNTF implant in one eye","interventionNames":["Drug: NT-501 CNTF Implant"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"NT-501 CNTF Implant","description":"Single implantation of CNTF-secreting NT-501 device into one eye","armGroupLabels":["NT-501 CNTF Implant"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety: Number of patients with adverse events","description":"Safety will be evaluated by determining the number of patients with adverse events, including loss of vision, visual field, or retinal/optic nerve structure, and ocular complications such as pain and inflammation.","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Efficacy: Vision, Visual Field, Pattern Electroretinogram, Visual Field Questionnaire-25","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Structural efficacy: Nerve fiber layer, optic nerve topography","timeFrame":"18 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age 40 years or older\n* must understand and sign the informed consent\n* must be medically able to undergo ophthalmic surgery for the NT-501 device insertion and possible removal, as well as the testing required.\n* diagnosis of ischemic optic neuropathy characterized by (a) non-arteritic subtype, including a normal ESR and CRP; (b) syndrome of acute unilateral visual loss with documented optic nerve head edema but without significant pain; (c) a relative afferent papillary defect in the affected eye, and a decrease of best-corrected visual acuity to 20/40 or worse in the affected eye, and detectable loss on visual field testing consistent with nerve fiber visual field defect but retaining measurable residual visual field preservation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* other corneal, lens, optic nerve or retinal disease causing vision loss,\n* blind in one eye\n* requirement of acyclovir and/or related products during study\n* receiving systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.\n* pregnant or lactating.\n* considered immunodeficient or has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* on chemotherapy, or a history of malignancy, UNLESS it was treated successfully 2 years prior to inclusion in the trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine","city":"Miami","state":"Florida","zip":"33136","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":25.77427,"lon":-80.19366}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009901","term":"Optic Nerve Diseases"},{"id":"D000018917","term":"Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000003389","term":"Cranial Nerve Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000005128","term":"Eye Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12522","name":"Optic Nerve Diseases","asFound":"Optic Neuropathy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20643","name":"Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic","asFound":"Ischemic Optic Neuropathy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6295","name":"Cranial Nerve Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7961","name":"Eye Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T429","name":"Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy","asFound":"Ischemic Optic Neuropathy","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC11","name":"Eye Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
