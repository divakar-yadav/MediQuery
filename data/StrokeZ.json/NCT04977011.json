The effectiveness of music intervention in reducing anxiety of patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of music intervention on anxiety, agitation, sleep quality and physiological parameters on patients in ICU. This study was conducted from January to June 2019. A total of 196 hospitalized ICU patients were divided into two groups. Subjects in experimental group received 30 minutes music intervention for 3 days on bedside whereas subjects in control group received routine care only. The primary outcome was anxiety. Agitation Sedation Scale, sleep quality and physical parameters were selected to collect as secondary outcomes.There was no significant difference between the groups at baseline. The results of this study support that music can reduce anxiety and agitation levels in ICU's patient. Nurses can incorporate this intervention into the daily care in order to reduce the discomfort of patients.","detailedDescription":"Background:Music intervention is a non-pharmacological and effective intervention that can alleviate anxiety and agitation in patients undergoing weaning.
