The investigators hope to gain knowledge that may help treat atrial fibrillation or flutter and lower stroke and adverse cardiovascular event risks for African American and Black patients by increasing the use of blood thinning medications known as anticoagulants.","detailedDescription":"This is a multi-site research study including sites of both the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (UMass Memorial Healthcare System) and the University of Michigan Medical Center (Michigan).\n\nBaseline call: During the baseline call, the investigators will obtain verbal informed consent. During the call, the investigators will also collect demographic information and measure health literacy, the latter using two validated single-item instruments the investigators have used before.\n\nRandomization: The investigators will randomize patients to watch videos the investigators developed (intervention) versus informational videos (controls). More specifically, the investigators will randomize patients separately by study site (UMass/Michigan), using randomly permuted blocks of sizes 4 and 6 embedded into a prespecified table.\n\nExit interview: The exit interview will be conducted approximately 90 days from the date of enrollment with study participants. Interview questions will relate to whether the patient has already started AC, the likelihood of starting anticoagulation (AC), barriers to starting AC, and burdensomeness and acceptability of the interview.\n\nChart review: The investigators will also perform chart review to capture information that will inform whether the investigators achieved balance in treatment allocation groups on important factors related to study outcomes. Chart review will also provide covariate information which the investigators will use in outcome analysis. Through HIPAA authorization, the investigators will extract information related to age, gender, insurance status, prior AC use, CHA2DS2VASc stroke risk score, comorbidities associated with bleeding, and adherence to preventive health screening.\n\nData Security: Analyses will be performed using only limited datasets, and only aggregate data will be reported. All data will be used for research purposes only; published data will not contain any individual identifiers and will be reported in the aggregate.\n\nThe proposed study involves no more than minimal risk to participants.\n\nThe potential benefits to subjects from study participation include increased knowledge of atrial fibrillation and AC and improved rates of adherence to AC guidelines. This may in turn prevent strokes or limit bleeding that would otherwise have occurred without the benefit of this intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Flutter","Adherence, Medication","Anticoagulants and Bleeding Disorders","Stroke","Bleeding","Narration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention - Patient Videos","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Videos of African Americans currently taking anticoagulation talking about their experiences with using anticoagulation or blood thinners and successfully navigating setbacks occurring with use including bleeding, falls, strokes, and affording the medications.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Storytelling Intervention"]},{"label":"Control - Informational Videos (not patients)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Informational videos about anticoagulation and blood thinners presented by experts or actors."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Storytelling Intervention","description":"Participants assigned to the intervention group will watch videos presenting stories of African American patients about their experiences with using anticoagulation or blood thinners throughout a 90-day period.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention - Patient Videos"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fidelity via viewing time","description":"Time spent viewing videos","timeFrame":"90 days from randomization"},{"measure":"Fidelity via transportation","description":"In intervention patients, measure transportation (absorption into a story) using a transportation scale short form where the minimum and maximum values are 1 (Not at all) and 7 (Very much), respectively.
