The three aims are:\n\nAim 1: Investigate the behavioral effect of 5 daily sessions of anodal tDCS over the ipsilesional M1 on PSF.\n\nAim 2: Investigate the neurophysiological effect of 5 daily sessions of anodal tDCS over the ipsilesional M1.\n\nAim 3: Determine the relationship between changes in M1 excitability, brain connectivity and changes in PSF.\n\nParticipants will receive either a real or sham stimulation for 5 consecutive days and fatigue will be assessed before, immediately after and 1-month after the intervention. Fatigue will be assessed using clinical, behavioral, and neurophysiological outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Up to 85% stroke survivors experience post-stroke fatigue (PSF) defined as intensified perceived effort during activities. PSF is a significant barrier to full participation in rehabilitation and negatively affects quality of life after stroke. Despite its well-known impacts, there are very few targeted interventions for PSF largely due to unclear underlying mechanisms. A few brain stimulation studies have suggested a relationship between primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and PSF. Recent clinical trials using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate brain excitability reported mixed clinical efficacy in reducing PSF with unclear mechanisms of action.\n\nThe proposed research will address the gaps in our knowledge by determining the behavioral and neural correlates of PSF using an experimental design and multimodal approach.\n\nThirty-two individuals with significant fatigue due stroke will be randomly assigned to receive five consecutive sessions of anodal or sham tDCS. Before and after intervention, participants will complete clinical and behavioral assessments of PSF, brain excitability assessment using transcranial magnetic stimulation, and brain connectivity assessment using resting state functional MRI. In aim 1, the investigators will determine if upregulating M1 excitability via tDCS will reduce PSF assessed by clinical and behavioral markers. Aim 2 will utilize brain stimulation and brain imaging techniques to probe the neurophysiological effect of tDCS on PSF. Aim 3 will explore the relationship between changes in neurophysiological outcomes and changes in PSF.\n\nThe long-term goal of the team is to develop evidence based, theory-driven interventions to manage PSF. The proposed study is innovative in that it investigates a relative novel intervention to mitigate PSF and adopts a multimodal approach to examine the underlying mechanisms. The comprehensive research will guide the development of treatment targeted the underlying mechanisms of PSF. In addition to its scientific and clinical significances, the proposed research will achieve its educational goals by fostering a group of student researchers and promoting rigorous research cultures within the investigator's institute."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal tDCS group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive anodal tDCS applied to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex.","interventionNames":["Device: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive sham tDCS applied to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex","interventionNames":["Device: Sham transcranial direct current stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation","description":"Anodal tDCS will be delivered for 5 consecutive days.
