Several studies demonstrated that single BTI-session in a single muscle of paretic lower limb(LL) improved kinematic gait parameters(GP) but surprisingly none of them assessed the effects of repetitive multifocal BTI on patient's gait pattern and their duration.\n\nThe aim was to evaluate the impact of repetitive multifocal BTI-sessions on GP of chronic stroke patients. To that end, gait of patients has been compared using 3D-gait analysis after at least 2 consecutive BTI sessions.","detailedDescription":"All the patients will be tretaed with BTI . these injections will be performed under electrical stimulation control (\\~5mA). The dose, the number of site of injection per muscle is at the discretion of the physician according to patients' needs and physicians' routine clinical practice. The dilution the most commonly used will depend on the type of BoNT-A (BOTOX®, XEOMIN® or DYSPORT®) and was 100 U for 2.5ml (BOTOX® and XEOMIN®) or 500 U for 2.5 ml (Dysport®)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Effect of Repeated Botulinum Toxin Injection on Gait Pattern in Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["botulinum toxin injection","stroke","3D motion analysis","gait pattern"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chronic spastic stroke patients","description":"Chronic spastic stroke patients treated regularly with botulinum toxin injection in lower limb muscles","interventionNames":["Other: Motion analysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motion analysis","description":"Motion analysis was used to assess the modifications of gait pattern in chronic spastic stroke patients regularly treated with botulinum toxin injection","armGroupLabels":["Chronic spastic stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"kinematics gait parameters","description":"peak knee flexion in swing phase(°)","timeFrame":"3h"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"spatiotemporal gait parmeters","description":"gait velocity(m/s)","timeFrame":"3h"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n-\\>18 years\n\n* a single hemispheric cerebral vascular lesion more than 6 months previously\n* able to walk 10 meters without any assistance\n* having benefited of at least 2 consecutive BTI sessions, second 3D gait analysis performed at least 3 months after the last BTI.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient's refusal to participate to the study\n* Inability to read the selected text\n* Inability to cooperate\n* No affiliation to social security","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"STROKE PATIENTS","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"ROCHE Nicolas, MDPHD","affiliation":"HOPITAL RAYMOND POINCARE-GARCHES","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hopital Raymond Poincare","city":"Garches","zip":"92380","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.84226,"lon":2.18232}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4873","name":"Botulinum Toxins","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
