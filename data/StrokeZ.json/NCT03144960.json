When the compensatory mechanism of collateral circulation fails, perfusion is compromised, leading to decreased perfusion and cell death. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Many people die each year from stroke in the United States.Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. Nearly one fourth of strokes occur in people under the age of 65.High blood pressure is the most important risk factor for stroke. Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator is the only Food and Drug Administration approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a large vessel occlusion.There is no apparent benefit of intravenous thrombolysis to patients with ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The study will be performed involving ischemic stroke patients with proximal occlusion within 4.5 hours from stroke onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mechanical thrombectomy","type":"OTHER","description":"The study will be performed involving ischemic stroke patients with proximal occlusion within 4.5 hours from stroke onset, mechanical thrombectomy with retrievable stents, thrombus aspiration, retraction, wire disruption.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mechanical Thrombectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mechanical Thrombectomy","description":"mechanical thrombectomy with retrievable stents, thrombus aspiration, retraction, wire disruption","armGroupLabels":["mechanical thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Treatment Of Acute Occlusion In Ischemic Stroke by Mechanical Thrombectomy","description":"Treatment of ischemic stroke patients after 4.5 hours from stroke onset by endovascular intervention by using Mechanical Thrombectomy techniques and without using Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen Activator and non eligible patients for Thrombectomy will be excluded.\n\nThe number of people will be participated into this study will be 20 aged 18 to 80 years old The patients will be undergoing NIHSS score , ASPECTS score The patients will be undergoing CT/CT angiography The patients will be undergoing mechanical thrombectomy Results will be collected and correlated with the prognosis of the outcomes","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The patients will be undergoing NIHSS score","description":"patients with NIHSS score less than 10 non eligible for mechanical thrombectomy","timeFrame":"1 hour"},{"measure":"The patients will be undergoing ASPECTS score","description":"patients with ASPECTS score less than 6 non eligible for mechanical thrombectomy","timeFrame":"1 hour"},{"measure":"The patients will be undergoing CT/CT angiography","description":"ct and ct angiography for exclusion of any bleeding or head injury","timeFrame":"2 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
