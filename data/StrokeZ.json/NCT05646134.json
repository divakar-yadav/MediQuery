The main questions it seeks to answer are:\n\n1. Whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has a positive effect on upper extremity motor function in stroke patients.\n2. Which stimulation protocol (low frequency - LF or high-frequency - HF) has better outcomes for improving upper extremity motor function in stroke patients? Participants will receive 10 procedures of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over two weeks. They will be randomly assigned into low-frequency, high-frequency rTMS groups or sham stimulation groups. Upper extremity motor function will be evaluated twice: before stimulation and 3-4 weeks after stimulation.\n\nResearchers will compare sham stimulation to see if it has the same or better outcomes for improving upper extremity motor function in stroke patients than real rTMS.","detailedDescription":"The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on upper extremity motor function in stroke patients.
