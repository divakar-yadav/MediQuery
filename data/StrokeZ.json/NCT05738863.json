Functional limitations that develop in the post-stroke period affect the quality of life and activities of daily living of the patients. The main purpose of stroke rehabilitation is to improve the quality of life of patients in the areas of physical, functional, psychological and social health.\n\nPost-stroke urinary incontinence (PSUI) is a common complication that manifests as involuntary loss of urine. It has been reported that post-stroke urinary incontinence (PSUI) affects 40-60% of patients admitted to the hospital after stroke, up to 25% still have problems when they are discharged from the hospital, and 15% remain incontinence one year later. Recent studies have shown that 79% of stroke survivors develop urinary incontinence.\n\nIt has been reported that this complication is also associated with psychological problems such as low self-esteem and anxiety. In addition, the presence of urinary incontinence has been considered a marker of stroke severity and a higher mortality rate than those without urinary incontinence. Therefore, Post-stroke urinary incontinence (PSUI) management is critical and should be the goal of all stroke health professionals.\n\nIn recent years, there is a need for more effective approaches on neuroplasticity mechanisms in stroke rehabilitation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an innovative approach applied in this field. With the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is aimed to modulate plasticity and restore the normal activity pattern.\n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a painless non-invasive technique widely used in clinical routine practice to modulate the neural excitability of the human brain. High frequency rTMS (\\>5 Hz) increases neural activity (long term potentiation), while low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS decreases neural activity (long term depression).\n\nPrevious studies have shown that detrusor overactivity (DO) constitutes the major urodynamic model of post-stroke urinary incontinence (PSUI).This suggests that the brain, which is the center of incontinence with detrusor overactivity, is a potential target for therapeutic interventions.\n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a newly developed noninvasive brain stimulation method for the treatment of neurological disorders.When applied to cortical areas corresponding to the pelvic region, it can modulate cortical excitability and induce long-lasting neuroplastic changes.\n\nHigh-frequency rTMS (\\>5 Hz) increases neural activity (long-term potentiation), low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS decreases neural activity. (long-term depression). Clinical studies have shown that inhibition of bladder activity is possible with low frequency (≤ 1 Hz) rTMS in the primary motor cortex (M1).\n\nOur primary aim is to investigate the effect of low-frequency rTMS treatment on urinary system dysfunctions in the primary motor cortex (M1) in stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms"],"keywords":["hemiplegia","urinary dysfunction","detrusor overactivity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Effects of Repetative Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy on Lower Urinary System Dysfunctions in Stroke Patients; A Randomized Study of Double Blind With Sham Control","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low Frequency rTMS Protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"It was planned to apply 1 Hz low-frequency inhibition protocol to the primary motor cortex 5 days a week for 3 weeks, for a total of 15 sessions.","interventionNames":["Device: Low Frequency rTMS Protocol"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS Protocol","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"It was planned to apply the recorded beat sound to the primary motor cortex area daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks, for a total of 15 sessions by turning the TMS coil with the reverse side and in a 90-angle upright position.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham rTMS Protocol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low Frequency rTMS Protocol","description":"It was planned to apply 1 Hz low-frequency inhibition protocol to the primary motor cortex 5 days a week for 3 weeks, for a total of 15 sessions.\n\nrTMS application Magventure MagPro R30 device is planned to provide magnetic stimulation with its stimulator.
