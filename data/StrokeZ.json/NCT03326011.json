All subjects will receive training 3 times per week for 8 weeks for 24 training sessions. Each session is directed by a licensed physical therapist and lasted 60 min (including rest period of 10 min). Brain activity and gait assessment will be performed at visits 0 (baseline), 24 (post-test), and at 3 months (follow-up) after training.\n\nPrimary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and cortical activation measured by functional Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany).\n\nSecondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function improvement evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Push and Release (P\\&R) test, Functional Reach Test (FRT), Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES), Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion (ROM)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gait Disorders, Neurologic","Stroke"],"keywords":["Exoskeleton Device","Gait rehabilitation","Chronic storke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gait training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Gait training with Samsung Hip Assist v1 All subjects receive gait training 3 times per week for 8 weeks for 24 training sessions.","interventionNames":["Device: Samsung Hip Assist v1"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Samsung Hip Assist v1","description":"All subjects receive gait training 3 times per week for 8 weeks for 24 training sessions.
