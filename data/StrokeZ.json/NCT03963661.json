If this happens, people may not be aware of anything on one side, usually the same side they also lost their movement (the most affected side). This severe condition is called spatial neglect. Currently there is no recommended diagnostic test or clinically-proven treatment for the condition. In a recent study, the investigators found a long-lasting reduction in neglect if people practiced picking-up an object with their unaffected hand. This intervention is called Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy (SIGHT). It requires people to lift wooden rods of different lengths. Once a person is familiar with the task, they can practice on their own at a time convenient to them in their homes. The investigators have developed the first computerized version of SIGHT (c-SIGHT) as well as a novel diagnostic test for neglect using portable low-cost motion-tracking technology that can be used in the patient's home. In the proposed study, the investigators will investigate how usable and acceptable this technology is in people's homes. Stroke survivors (recruited from community settings) will undergo a 7-day self-led training at their homes with c-SIGHT. At the end of the intervention, 1:1 semi-structured interviews will be carried out with both stroke survivors and carers to investigate usability and acceptability of c-SIGHT. Moreover, spatial neglect, carer burden and motor function will be assessed pre- and post-completion of c-SIGHT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Injuries","Spatial Neglect","Attention Deficit"],"keywords":["Telerehabilitation","Spatial neglect","SIGHT","Computorized therapy","Stroke","Innatention","Self-admnistered therapy","Usability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"c-SIGHT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SIGHT requires participants to grasp and lift rods with their less impaired arm.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: c-SIGHT (computorized spatial innatention grasping home-based therapy)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"c-SIGHT (computorized spatial innatention grasping home-based therapy)","description":"C-SIGHT will be self-administered at people's homes. c-SIGHT is a computerized therapy administered via people's television.
