The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What make some patients develop epilepsy after a stroke?\n* Does sleep have an impact on the development of post-stroke epilepsy?\n\nParticipants will undergo:\n\n* Electroencephalography (EEG)\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Polysomnography (only patients)\n\nBlood tests will also be taken. The patient group will be compared to the healthy controls. Researchers will also look into medical records of stroke patients hospitalized at St. Olavs hospital and collect relevant information.","detailedDescription":"This study aims to study risk factors and clinical factors which might contribute to the development of post-stroke epilepsy. Researchers will look at the volume and size of the stroke-induced brain lesions and analyze inflammation markers. Patients and controls will undergo EEG and MRI. The correlations between sleep and epilepsy after a stroke will also be investigated through polysomnography. Relevant information about for instance age, comorbidities and NIHSS will be collected. Researchers will also collect relevant information from medical records of stroke patients hospitalized at St. Olavs hospital."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post Stroke Epilepsy","Stroke","Epilepsy","Seizures"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Disorders","Vascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Patients with first time stroke admitted to the stroke unit, St. Olavs hospital, Trondheim, Norway.
