When reperfusion is not achieved in spite of rtPA therapy, endovascular therapy can be performed according to the judgment of a site investigator.\n\nStage 1-The trial will be conducted with 11 subjects participating in an open label design manner. Subjects with neurologic deficit of ≥4 point and ≤10 points on NIHSS score will be given SP-8203, 80mg/dose, a total of 6 times at intervals of 12 hours. For the first administration of SP-8203, it should be administered within 30 minutes from the initiation of rtPA administration via a vein route different from one via which rtPA is injected.\n\nThereafter, the subject will be transferred to MRI scanning room to have brain MRI and MRA performed, and brain CT will be performed to check the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage at 24 hours after complete administration of the first dose of SP-8203. The subject will be closely monitored by research staff daily from the day of first administration of SP-8203 (Day 0) to Day 5. Brain MRI and MRA will be followed up after the last administration of SP-8203 on Day 5. The subject will make a visit on Day 14 to have his/her neurologic symptoms checked, after which subject's participation in the trial will be completed.\n\n\\*The DSMB (Date Safety Monitoring Board) meeting will be held, to decide whether to proceed with Stage 2 or not, based on the results of Stage 1.\n\nStage 2- A total of 69 subjects will be enrolled in double-blind, randomized and parallel design with 23 subjects assigned to low-dose (40mg/dose, 80mg/ day) SP-8203 group, high-dose (80mg/dose, 160mg/day) SP-8203 group or placebo group, respectively.\n\nIf a subject, who is able to be enrolled in Stage 2, has neurological deficit of ≥4 point on NIHSS score and give patient's consent to participate in the trial, randomization will be performed and each treatment arm (one of three) will be assigned. The subject will receive the Investigational products a total of 6 times, with 12 hours intervals. Blood sample will be taken after the sixth administration of the Investigational product for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics analysis. For pharmacokinetic analysis , blood sample will be taken at 0, 30, and 120 minutes after the complete sixth administration of the investigational products. For pharmacodynamics analysis, blood sample will be taken at between 24 to 48 hours after the first administration, at 0 minute after the sixth administration and at 4th week visit.\n\nAs with Stage 1, the subject will have brain MRI and MRA performed after the administration of investigational product, and brain CT will be performed at 24 hours after completion of the first administration of investigational products.\n\nBrain MRI and MRA will be followed-up on Day 5, similarly to Stage 1. However, in Stage 2, the subject will make a visit for close monitoring for patient's neurological condition at 4th week and 12th week. Thereafter, all the procedures of the clinical trial will be completed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["rtPA","Intracranial hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SP-8203 High dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SP-8203 160mg (80mg/dose twice a day for three days)","interventionNames":["Drug: SP-8203 High dose"]},{"label":"SP-8203 Low dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SP-8203 80mg (40mg/dose twice a day for three days)","interventionNames":["Drug: SP-8203 Low dose"]},{"label":"Placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo group: twice a day for three days","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"SP-8203 High dose","description":"High-dose group: 160mg will be intravenously administered as 80mg/dose twice daily (intervals of 12 hours).","armGroupLabels":["SP-8203 High dose group"],"otherNames":["SP-8203 is produced by Shin Poong Pharmaceutical company"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"SP-8203 Low dose","description":"Low dose group: 80mg will be intravenously administered as 40mg/dose twice daily (intervals of 12 hours).","armGroupLabels":["SP-8203 Low dose group"],"otherNames":["SP-8203 is produced by Shin Poong Pharmaceutical company"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Same dosage of SP8203.
