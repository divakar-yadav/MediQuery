There are two phases in the study: 1) Screening - this phase determines if the individual is a good candidate to receive an implanted system, 2) Implantation, controller development, and evaluation - this phase includes installing the device and setting the individual up for home use, creating advanced controllers for walking and evaluating the effect of the device over several months.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of neural stimulation for improving walking after stroke. Participants will undergo surgery to implant a stimulator and electrodes to activate muscles used during walking. The device delivers electrical pulses to the nerves causing the muscles to contract to perform functional movements. The system coordinates assistance based on external sensors. After receiving the implanted device, participants undergo training to use the device to assist walking. Evaluations are completed prior to surgery as well after training and at later follow up sessions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Implantation, controller development, and evaluation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This phase includes installing the device and setting the individual up for home use, creating advanced controllers for walking and evaluating the effect of the device over several months.","interventionNames":["Device: IRS-8","Device: IST 12 & IST 16"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"IRS-8","description":"Implanted Receiver Stimulator (IRS) delivering 8 channels of stimulation.
