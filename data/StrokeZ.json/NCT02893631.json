It rises questions regarding hemostasis: thrombolysis induces fibrinolysis but its effects on coagulation, fibrinogen and platelets and duration of these effects are unknown. Thus management of antithrombotics and hemostasis during thrombectomy and surgery is an issue.\n\nObjectives : to describe thrombolysis-induced hemostatic disorders (fibrinolysis, coagulation, fibrinogen, platelets) in patients requiring thrombectomy for stroke and to evaluate the time required for the normalization of these disorders.\n\nMethods : Observational monocentric study including rtPA-treated patients requiring endovascular treatment for stroke. Blood sampling within the first 48 hours after rtPA administration to assess of fibrinolysis, coagulation and platelet functions with point of care devices and specific laboratory tests. Record of clinical and biological data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"fibrinolysis activity","description":"Time required for normalization of fibrinolysis","timeFrame":"until normalization of fibrinolytic activity, up to 48 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient over 18\n* treatment with rtPA for an acute stroke\n* endovascular treatment required\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* opposition to participate in the study\n* long term anticoagulant-treated patient\n* pregnant patient","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"rtPA-treated patients requiring endovascular treatment for ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Marie-Claire NGHE, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Fondation OPH A de Rothschild","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild","city":"Paris","zip":"75019","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9266","name":"Hemostatics","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13539","name":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13538","name":"Plasminogen","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Coag","name":"Coagulants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"}]}},"hasResults":false}
