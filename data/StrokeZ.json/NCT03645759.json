The treatment will then be tested to ensure it makes the desired improvements in the Veterans.","detailedDescription":"The study has three aims. The first aim is to develop a client-centered, behavioral stroke self-management program (I'm Whole) for Veterans with stroke and psychological distress (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and/or depression). This will be done using expert input from a multidisciplinary team of a clinical psychologist, nurse practitioner, exercise physiologist and social role functioning expert will be used to create the I'm Whole patient workbook and clinician manual.\n\nThe second aim is to pilot the I'm Whole treatment by delivering the intervention to 5 Veterans suffering from stroke and comorbid depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The feasibility (barriers and facilitators to completing I'm Whole and acceptability of the intervention) will be assessed through qualitative interviews posttreatment. Veterans' feedback about ways to improve I'm Whole will be analyzed and used to improve treatment.\n\nThe third aim is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of I'm Whole on quality of life (primary outcome) physical functioning, physical activity, social role functioning, psychological distress, and satisfaction with I'm Whole (secondary outcomes). To test the feasibility and efficacy, a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 Veterans (15 I'm Whole and 15 education+usual care) with stroke and psychological distress will be conducted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Depression","Anxiety"],"keywords":["behavioral treatment","telehealth","stroke self-management","psychological distress","social integration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Behavioral treatment intervention that focuses on enhancing stroke self-management, psychological distress and social functioning that will be provided to two groups (treatment and education plus usual care).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"No other parties will be masked","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"I'm Whole","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This arm will receive 6 behavioral health treatment sessions that focus on stroke self-management, psychological distress and social re-integration.
