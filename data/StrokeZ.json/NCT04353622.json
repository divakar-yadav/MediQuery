However, studies about the effects of stroke rehabilitation with robotic devices are limited.\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of upper extremity robotic rehabilitation on motor function and quality of life in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"Stroke survivors have difficulties in participating in activities of daily living due to functional disabilities. The majority of patients after stroke need rehabilitation to gain independence in daily life as the first target. Therefore, different treatment approaches are used in stroke rehabilitation.\n\nThe use of technology in stroke rehabilitation has become very common in recent years. Robotic devices used in rehabilitation enhance the healing process by giving patients more intensive and task-oriented exercises. A lot of systematic and meta-analysis studies have shown that robot-assisted devices provide positive motor recoveries, especially in the treatment of upper extremities. However, the optimal timing, duration, and dose of robotic rehabilitation that should be applied after stroke remain uncertain.\n\nIn the light of this information, this study examines the effects of the robotic device produced for upper limb rehabilitation on daily life activities and motor function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper Extremity Dysfunction"],"keywords":["Stroke","Upper extremity","Robotic rehabilitation","Motor function","Quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-assisted Treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Rehabilitation protocol was applied with robotic device (HOUSTONBIONİCS ExoRehab UE1).","interventionNames":["Device: Exoskeleton robot for upper extremity"]},{"label":"Conventional Physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional physiotherapy program included neurophysiological approaches.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Exoskeleton robot for upper extremity","description":"Robot-assisted Treatment Program:\n\n* 10 minutes elbow flexion/extension\n* 10 minutes forearm supination/pronation\n* 10 minutes wrist flexion/extension\n* 10 minutes ulnar/radial deviation\n\nFrequency: 2/week Duration: 12 sessions (6 weeks)","armGroupLabels":["Robot-assisted Treatment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional physiotherapy","description":"Ferquency: 2/week Duration: 12 sessions (6weeks) Each session: 50 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Physiotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment","description":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment is an index to assess physical performance in individuals who had a stroke.
