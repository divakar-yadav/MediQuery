Collateral status differs among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Relatively sparse attention has been devoted to the role of baseline collateral circulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke who are candidates for revascularization. This study aim to investigate the correlation between baseline collateral circulation and the likelihood of opening of an arterial occlusion, the extent of reperfusion, tissue injury and clinical impairment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"10mL venous blood sample will be collected Each participant"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","description":"Good functional outcome will be defined by a Modified Rankin Scale of 0-2, 3 months after stroke onset","timeFrame":"3 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age â‰¥ 18 years.\n* Mechanical thrombectomy initiated within 24 hours after onset\n* CT perfusion can be performed before the initiation of thrombectomy and 24h after thrombectomy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication to imaging with contrast agents\n* Delay between imaging and beginning of thrombectomy \\> 90 minutes","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients experiencing brain infarction complicating the large-vessel occlusion","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ying M Fu, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+8613920263688","email":"fuying@fjmu.eu.cn"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Fuzhou","zip":"350000","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Ying M Fu, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+8613920263688","email":"fuying@fjmu.eu.cn"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":26.06139,"lon":119.30611}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
