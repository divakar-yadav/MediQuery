The participants will be examined with a TWST, lip force test, and videofluoroscopy (VFS) of oropharyngeal swallowing before (baseline), after 5-weeks training (end-of-training) and at a 12-18 months follow-up.

Evaluations are made at baseline, at end of training, and at late follow-up after a period without training to investigate if any lasting positive training effect was present.\n\nInclusion criteria: First-ever stroke and a pathological timed water swallow test (TWST) at four to five weeks after stroke onset.\n\nExclusion criteria: Inability to cooperate, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), neurological diseases other than stroke, known history of dysphagia, prominent horizontal overbite, hypersensitivity to the acrylate in the oral device.\n\nStudy procedure: Four weeks after stroke onset, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia and pathological swallowing according to the timed water swallow test (TWST) will be randomized 1:1 into a 5-week oral neuromuscular training with an oral device in addition to orofacial sensory-vibration stimulation with an electrical toothbrush (intervention group) or orofacial sensory-vibration stimulation only (control group).
