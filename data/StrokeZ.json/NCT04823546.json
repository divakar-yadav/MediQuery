Functional independence and locomotion are hampered in stroke, therefore, affecting their quality of life. Objective: To find the comparative effects of activity base therapy vs strength training on gait performance in chronic stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"It was a randomized controlled trial, conducted in physical therapy department of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. 20 chronic stroke patients were equally divided into two groups. In group-A patients were treated with activity base therapy and in group-B patients were treated with strength training. Patients were treated for a total of 6 weeks (12 sessions), 1 hour in a day, 3 times per week. Patients were assessed using Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and Fugl Meyer Examination-Lower Extremity (FME-LE). SPSS 25 was used toanalyze the dat"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Activity based therapy","Chronic stroke","Gait","strength training","exercises"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Activity based therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Activity based training was done in 2 phases. exercise involve\n\n1.
