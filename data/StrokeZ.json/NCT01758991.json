It would be interesting to enhance the therapeutic effect of swallowing retraining by means on non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\nHypothesis: during the acute phase of stroke, applying tDCS over the brain during the revalidation and/or supervised feeding improves dysphagia significantly when compared to sham tDCS.","detailedDescription":"tDCS will be used in a double-blind, randomized control trial in acute stroke patients suffering from dysphagia.\n\nAfter informed consent and recruitment, patients will be randomly (computer method) allocated to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied during swallowing exercices/therapy or supervised feeding.\n\nBaseline and follow-up outcomes about dysphagia will be collected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Dysphagia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"tDCS","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"randomisation by computer","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"real tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients will receive non-invasive and painless brain stimulation over the rain areas involved in swallowing.\n\ntDCS will be applied during swallowing therapy, during 20 minutes","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"sham tDCS","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"this will be exactly as for \"real tDCS\" unless that the tDCS will be rapidly turned off, unbeknown from patients-therapist-examinator (double-blind trial)","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","description":"tDCS is a safe and painless transcranial stimulation that modulates brain activity and could improve stroke recovery.
