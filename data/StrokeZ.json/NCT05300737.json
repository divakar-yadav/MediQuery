Since the landmark trials (NASCET, ECST), there have been new developments in medical stroke prevention, which creates a gap in knowledge. The aim of this study is to evaluate that clinical care with Intensive Medical Therapy (IMT) alone, the one year stroke rate in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and low risk clinical features will be \\<5%.","detailedDescription":"This study will only be evaluating clinical care and no interventions will be done specifically for this research.\n\n* Informed consent from patient or legally authorized representative.\n* Participant survey/questionnaire completion at baseline, 6 and 12 months after enrollment\n* All data collected will be entered into a secure research data registry created for this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Stenosis","Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":114,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Symptomatic carotid stenosis with low risk features","description":"50-99% symptomatic carotid stenosis with low clinical or radiologic risk features (see inclusion criteria) Patients will receive intensive medical therapy, including dual antiplatelet therapy, high potency statins, BP control, and lifestyle modification","interventionNames":["Other: intensive medical therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"intensive medical therapy","description":"Dual antiplatelet therapy, high potency statins, HTN control, lifestyle modification","armGroupLabels":["Symptomatic carotid stenosis with low risk features"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ischemic stroke","description":"ipsilateral to carotid stenosis, with radiologic confirmation","timeFrame":"within 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Myocardial infarction","description":"ECG will be performed for suspected myocardial infarction and will be diagnosed if appropriate ST changes and confirmation with troponin measurements","timeFrame":"within 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥40 years plus stroke or TIA ipsilateral to 50-99% ICA stenosis\n\nIn addition, patients must have at least one clinical or radiologic marker of reduced stroke risk\n\nClinical Reduced Stroke RISK:\n\n1.
