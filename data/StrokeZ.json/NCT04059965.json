Therefore, we propose to implement a health information technology (HIT) population management tool at two distinct anticoagulation clinics that will allow the care team to assign and track tasks essential for timely patient monitoring. We will examine its effect on anticoagulation management outcomes through a randomized trial, hypothesizing that such interventions can be effective as well as cost-effective strategies to improve patient safety in the context of anticoagulation management services."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anticoagulation","Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Flutter","Pulmonary Embolus/Emboli","Deep Vein Thrombosis","Stroke","Hypercoagulability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This cohort of patients will receive panel management through a customize software that integrates with the electronic health record","interventionNames":["Other: Panel Management for Anticoagulation Therapy"]},{"label":"Control Arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This cohort of patients will receive usual care","interventionNames":["Other: Usual Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Panel Management for Anticoagulation Therapy","description":"Patients in the intervention arm will receive notifications reminding them of upcoming labs and appointments.
