The CIQ-R scale developed by Callaway et al assesses home integration, social integration, productivity, and electronic social networking in neurological diseases. It has 18 questions. This study will be conducted with stroke patients. The patients will be sought to answer questionnaires during regular rehabilitation sessions. 130 participants will be included in the study. In order to evaluate the validity of the CIQ-R, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which can evaluates general cognitive functioning and has been validated in Turkish, will be used. Scales will be repeated after 15 days to assess test-retest reliability.","detailedDescription":"The reliability and validity of the scale will begin with language equivalence and cultural adaptation. The scale will be translated from English to Turkish by two people who are fluent in Turkish and English. A single Turkish translation will be obtained from these two Turkish translations with a common opinion.\n\nThe scale, which has been translated into Turkish, will be translated into English by two other people who are fluent in Turkish and English. The scale translated into English will be compared with the original. If the developer of the scale, Callaway and Willer approves the translation of the scale, participants will be recruited for the study. In the pre-trial phase, a reassessment will be conducted with 15 participants to test the intelligibility of the scale. Based on the results of the pre-test phase, the final version of CIQ-R will be able to be modified. The data of CIQ-R are collecting through face-to-face when the patients came to the rehabilitation center. 145 participants will be included in the study.\n\nIn order to evaluate the validity of the CIQ-R, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which can evaluates general cognitive functioning and has been validated in Turkish, will be used. Scales will be repeated after 15 days to assess test-retest reliability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Community Integration"],"keywords":["stroke","social networking","social participation","community integration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"15 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":130,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients","description":"The aim of this study is to adapt the Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised (CIQ-R)scale to Turkish society in stroke patients and to make its validity and reliability in Turkish.","interventionNames":["Other: Turkish Validity and Reliability of The CIQ-R Scale"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Turkish Validity and Reliability of The CIQ-R Scale","description":"The aim of this study is to adapt the Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised (CIQ-R)scale to Turkish society and to make its validity and reliability in Turkish.

It consists of 18 items in total. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-2 includes four sub-categories: Home Integration (HI), Social Integration (SI), Productivity (P), and Electronic Social Network (ESN).\n\nThe total score is the calculated sum of 18 items.

It evaluates general cognitive functioning (especially in the left cerebral hemisphere) and ranged from 0 to 30 points.
