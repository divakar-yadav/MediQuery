Although many studies have revealed that several genetic variants increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, the results of these studies remain controversial. The purpose of this study is to identify polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and to clarify the adequacy of reported susceptibility gene polymorphisms. To complete this purpose, we will prospectively study over 5,000 local residents in whom relationship between these polymorphisms and occurrence of cardiovascular disease over 5 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy","Coronary Disease","Myocardial Infarction","Cerebral Infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy subjects who undergo community-based annual health check in Kitanagoya city","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Mitsuhiro Yokota, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+81-52-759-2111","phoneExt":"369","email":"myokota@dpc.aichi-gakuin.ac.jp"},{"name":"Mitsuhiro Yokota, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+81-52-744-5515","email":"mitsuhiro.yokota@theranos-inst.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mitsuhiro Yokota, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Department of Genome Science, School o Dentistry, Aichi-Gakuin University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Genome Science, School of Dentistry, Aichi-Gakuin University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Nagoya","state":"Aichi","zip":"464-8651","country":"Japan","contacts":[{"name":"Mitsuhiro Yokota, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+81-52-759-2111","phoneExt":"369","email":"myokota@dpc.aichi-gakuin.ac.jp"},{"name":"Mitsuhiro Yokota, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":35.18147,"lon":136.90641}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28515798","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Nakatochi M, Ichihara S, Yamamoto K, Naruse K, Yokota S, Asano H, Matsubara T, Yokota M.
