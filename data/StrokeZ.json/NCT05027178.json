During the 12 weeks of focused care, chiropractic visits could be several times a week depending on the care plan. In addition to the chiropractic care, individuals will receive a physical examination and three follow-up assessments. The assessments in the CCR will include a non-invasive evaluation of the brain wave patterns using electroencephalography (EEG), completion of a few surveys, a balance assessment and a movement assessment. Qualified individuals will receive study treatment and care at no cost."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Data analysis - single blinded","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chiropractic care for Ischemic Stroke Patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"12 weeks of full spine chiropractic care will be provided to patient.
