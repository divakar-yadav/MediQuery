Various studies have investigated tDCS use in stroke patients with motor impairments (cumulatively about 200 cases). Although these studies are mostly \"proof of concept\" with small sample size, they do suggest that tDCS may improve motor function. However these two questions have not been addressed systematically:\n\n1. What is the optimal current for stroke patients?\n2. What is the optimal tDCS electrode montage for stimulation?\n\nThis proposal lays the scientific foundation for systematic application of tDCS in stroke recovery research by progressively increasing tDCS currents and montages that are both safe and efficacious in population with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","tDCS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Determine the Optimal tDCS current","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"We will invesitigate the optimal curent in range of 1 mA to 4 mA.
