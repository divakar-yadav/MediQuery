The randomized trial will compare conventional care, planar robot intervention and an intervention of planar and vertical robot training among patients with chronic, stable deficits. We will evaluate motor outcomes, effectiveness, cost, patient satisfaction and quality of life. The study will determine the efficacy of upper extremity robot therapy compared to supervised self-administered exercise therapy in patients with deficits due to stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Robot Exercise Group","interventionNames":["Device: Robotic Upper Extremity Neurorehabilitation"]},{"label":"Arm 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Traditional Upper Extremity Exercise Group","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional Upper Extremity Exercise Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robotic Upper Extremity Neurorehabilitation","description":"Upper extremity exercise using a planar robot Upper extremity exercise using a planar and vertical robot","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Traditional Upper Extremity Exercise Group","description":"Upper extremity stretching, skateboard reaching activities, and arm ergometer","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper Extremity Portion of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Performance Assessment","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
