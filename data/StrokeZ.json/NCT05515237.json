Numerous studies examining the application of CI therapy with UE rehabilitation after stroke have demonstrated strong evidence for improving the amount of use and the quality of the more-affected UE functional use in the participant's daily life situation.\n\nCI Therapy studies with adults, to date, have explored intensive treatment for participants with a range from mild-to-severe motor impairment following stroke with noted motor deficits and limited use of the more-affected arm and hand in everyday activities. Each CI Therapy protocol was designed for the level of impairment demonstrated by participants recruited for the study. However, often following stroke, patients not only have motor deficits but somatosensory impairments as well. The somatosensory issues have not, as yet, been systematically measured and trained in CI Therapy protocols with adults and represent an understudied area of stroke recovery. We hypothesize that participants with mild-to-severe motor impairment and UE functional use deficits can benefit from CI therapy protocols that include somatosensory measurement and training components substituted for portions of motor training without loss in outcome measure gains. Further, we hypothesize that adults can improve somatosensory outcomes as a result of a combined CI therapy plus somatosensory component protocol.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to systematically examine the feasibility of adding somatosensory components to CI Therapy protocols for patients having mild-to-severe impairment to improve more-affected UE use, motor ability, and sensory perception in the chronic phase of stroke recovery. Treatment will follow previous timeframes of CI Therapy protocols of 2 weeks of intervention for mild-to-moderate UE impairment and 3 weeks for severe UE impairment. The Motor Activity Log (MAL) and Grade 4/5 Motor Activity Log (G4/5 MAL) are used to measure use of the more affected UE by participants with mild-to-moderate impairment and severe impairment, respectively. Motor capacity is measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) for those with mild-to-moderate impairment and the Grade 5 - Graded Wolf Motor Function Test (G5-GWMFT) for those with severe UE impairment. Participants: 12 post-stroke participants in the chronic phase of recovery (at least 6 months post-stroke) will be enrolled. Participants in this study must at least meet the minimal motor criteria for severely impaired participants. Thus, prior to treatment, participants must be able to demonstrate movement more-affected UE including the ability to move the shoulder â‰¥ 30 toward flexion or abduction, initiate movement at the elbow for flexion and extension, and initiate movement at the wrist, fingers, or thumb. Outcome Measures: Aim 1 will be assessed using the MAL (Arm use) for mild-to-moderately impaired participants or the G4/5 MAL (Arm use) for severely impaired participants, WMFT (UE motor capacity) for mild-to-moderately impaired and G5-GWMFT (UE motor capacity) for severely impaired participants, SIS (Stroke Impact Scale - Quality of Life), Zung Depression Scale (ZDS-Mood), and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM - Functional activity preference, ability and satisfaction). All measures will be administered immediately pre-treatment and at post-treatment. The MAL or G4/5 MAL, SIS, COPM, and ZDS will also be administered at 3 months post-intervention by telephone. Aim 2 will be assessed by Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (rNSA-Sensation) and Semmes \\& Weinstein Monofilament Test (SWMT- Sensation). These measures will be performed immediately pre-treatment and at post-treatment. Intervention: Participants will receive CI therapy plus somatosensory training components for the more-affected upper extremity for 2-3 weeks (depending on the level of UE impairment severity) for 3.5 hours per weekday. Specific CI therapy strategies will be delivered as is described with the addition of somatosensory components for the more-affected arm and hand. CI therapy strategies include: 1.) supervised movement training for 3.5 hours 5 weekdays x 2-3 weeks; 2.) participants will wear a restraint mitt on the less-affected hand for the majority of their waking hours for the 2-3 weeks; 3.) a transfer package will be used to help the participant transfer their gains from the laboratory to the life situation. Sensory components may be used to increase sensory input to the brain and increase the attention of each participant to the more-affected UE. The sensory components may include 1.) sensory stimulation to the more-affected UE (e.g.; brushing the UE with soft bristle brush, vibration to the finger tips, massage to the UE, etc); 2.) sensory training tasks that require each participant to respond to what is felt through the UE (e.g.; object identification, temperature discrimination, material identification, etc.)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident)","Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Grade 2-5 CI Therapy + Sensory Components","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive CI Therapy + Sensory Components administered over the specific time frame of 2-3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Grade 2-5 CI Therapy + Sensory Components"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Grade 2-5 CI Therapy + Sensory Components","description":"All participants will receive CI Therapy + Sensory Components over a 2-3 weeks time frame.
