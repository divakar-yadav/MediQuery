The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine whether whole body vibration (WBV) has immediate beneficial effect in neuromotor performance in patients with stroke. It is hypothesized that a single session of WBV will induce significant improvement in leg muscle strength in people with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["vibration","muscle","cerebrovascular accident","exercise","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High frequency whole body vibration","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive a single 10-minute session of WBV therapy.
