It is expected that through early activities, the degree of disability of acute cerebral stroke patients can be reduced, the hemiplegic limbs can be restored, the function of activities of daily living can be improved, and anxiety and depression after stroke can be reduced, thereby greatly improving the quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["stroke","early mobilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":102,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"early mobilization in stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The first day is to elevate the head of the bed and sit for 5 minutes The second day is to elevate the head of the bed for 10 minutes and sit on the edge of the bed for 5 minutes.\n\nThe third day, sit on the edge of the bed for 10 minutes, get out of bed and stand for 10 minutes, and standing still for 5 minutes.

The BI is consisting of 10 common activities of daily living activities. Eight of the ten items represent activities related to personal care; the remaining 2 are related to mobility. A total score out of 100; the higher the score, the greater the degree of functional independence. The mRS scale runs from 0-6, the score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs, and 6 is death.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline psychological distress at 1and 3 months."},{"measure":"Assess changes in sychological distress","description":"Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scale. It consists of 14 items, which can be divided into two subscales of seven items each: the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the depression subscale (HADS-D). The total HADS score was ranged from 0 to 21. A score greater than or equal to 11 indicates that the patient has anxiety or depression.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline functional status at 2 weeks, 1, and 3 months."},{"measure":"Assess changes in quality of life","description":"The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) assesses other dimensions of health related quality of life: emotion, communication, memory and thinking, and social role function, The total SIS score was ranged from 16 to 90.
