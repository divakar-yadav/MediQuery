The patients' participation in the study concludes at that time (3 months from stroke onset). The study will randomize up to 476 patients over 4 years. The purpose of DEFUSE 3 is to assess the safety and efficacy of thrombectomy in carefully selected patients in an extended time window. Only the devices listed in this protocol will be used. Selection of the specific device (or devices) is determined by the individual endovascular therapist.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo either CT Perfusion/CT Angiogram or MR DWI/PWI/MRA studies prior to randomization. Patients who have evidence of an ICA or MCA M1 occlusion and a Target Mismatch Profile will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with one or more DEFUSE 3 approved thrombectomy devices (only the devices listed in this protocol are approved for use in DEFUSE 3) plus standard medical therapy versus standard medical therapy alone. Patients who are enrolled, but not randomized, will receive standard therapy according to local guidelines. Baseline data, and information about early stroke therapies, will be captured for this group of patients.\n\nRandomization of a maximum of 476 patients is planned. A novel adaptive design will identify, at interim analyses, the group with the best prospect for showing benefit from endovascular treatment, based on baseline core lesion volumes and the times since stroke onset. Interim analyses will be conducted at 200 and 340 patients, at which time the study may stop for efficacy/futility, or the inclusion criteria may be adjusted in the case of futility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["endovascular","endovascular procedure","Mechanical Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":182,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"endovascular thrombectomy therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Treatment with one or more thrombectomy devices (only the devices listed in this protocol are approved for use in DEFUSE 3) plus standard medical therapy for patients who have evidence of an ICA or MCA M1 occlusion and a Target Mismatch Profile.\n\nDevices approved for use in DEFUSE 3:\n\n* Trevo Retriever\n* Solitaire™ FR Revascularization Device\n* Penumbra thrombectomy system\n* Covidien MindFrame Capture Revascularization Device","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular Thrombectomy","Device: Trevo Retriever","Device: Solitaire™ FR Revascularization Device","Device: Penumbra thrombectomy system","Device: Covidien MindFrame Capture Revascularization Device"]},{"label":"Medical Management","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"standard medical therapy alone"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular Thrombectomy","description":"Patients will be treated with thrombectomy devices (stent-retrievers) and/or suction thrombectomy systems currently cleared by the FDA for thrombus removal in patients experiencing an acute stroke following the published instructions for use for these devices.
