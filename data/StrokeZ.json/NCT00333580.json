The purpose of this collaborative study is to take advantage of qualitative and quantitative expertise from the Gainesville, Florida, Rehabilitation Outcomes Research Center (RORC) with state-of-the-art gait intervention research being conducted at the Gainesville, Brain Rehabilitation Research Center (BRRC) and Cleveland, Functional Electrical Stimulation Center (FESC). Three interventions have received considerable attention for their demonstrated promise in improving gait and mobility in individuals with spinal cord injury and stroke; 1) manually assisted locomotor training (MLT), 2) robotic assisted locomotor training (RLT)and 3) functional electrical stimulation assisted gait training (FES-GT). These interventions will be the basis for improving existing outcome measures and developing new outcome measures. The process of developing and evaluating valid outcome measures requires four phases of development. This study encompasses Phases I and II. Phase I (Year 1 of grant)will involve completing qualitative research studies to identify constructs reflecting the impact of MLT, RLT and FES-GT on Veterans. Data will be systematically collected using ethnographic field observations and in depth, semi-structured interviews. Phase II (Year 2) will involve using the identified constructs to develop item banks for Veterans-centered outcome measures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["Ethnography","Psychometrics","Qualitative Research"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Narrative from qualitative interviews and ethnographic analysis of video diaries.","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with stroke and patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries currently enrolled in locomotor/gait training studies at the VA BRain Rehabilitation Research Center, Gainesville, FL and the VA Functional Electrical Stimulation Center, Cleveland, Ohio, Competence for inclusion in the treatment intervention study (and the present study) is passing the 3-step command component of the Mini Mental Status Exam.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unable to pass the 3-step command component of the Mini-Mental Exam.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Veteran and non-veteran male/females with stroke or incomplete spinal cord injury currently enrolled in locomotor/gait training studies.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System","city":"Gainesville","state":"Florida","zip":"32608","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":29.65163,"lon":-82.32483}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"18566921","type":"RESULT","citation":"Hannold EM, Hanjian JM, Jordan MM, Roach MJ, Velozo CA.
