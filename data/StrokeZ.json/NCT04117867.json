Maintaining blood pressure near preoperative baseline values may help decrease the incidence of stroke, however the related evidence is limited.Therefore, this study is to investigate the association between intraoperative hemodynamic variable and the risk of perioperative stroke after non-cardiac and non-neurologic surgeries.

A definition of baseline value most frequently reported was the arterial blood pressure before the induction of anesthesia.
