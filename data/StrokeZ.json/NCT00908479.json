We propose to design an exercise program for the affected leg that would be given to the client as homework and done in the client's hospital room or ward. The program would be designed and monitored by a therapist that works in the hospital.","detailedDescription":"In total 120 participants admitted for stroke rehabilitation in the province British Columbia, Canada will be randomly assigned to either the Leg Exercise group or Leg Management group. The extra leg exercise group (experimental group) will receive usual therapy plus 60 minutes per day of self-directed leg exercises. This program will last for 4 weeks while the participant is in the hospital. The Leg Exercise program will include exercises of range of motion, leg strengthening, weight-bearing, and walking. The family will be encouraged to participate in the program with the participant. The control group (Leg Management group) will receive usual therapy and stroke education."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)"],"keywords":["Exercise","Rehabilitation","leg function","in patient","RCT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":142,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Leg Exercise group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Leg Exercise Program"]},{"label":"LM","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Leg Management (Control group)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Leg Management group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Leg Exercise Program","description":"Participants will engage in an extra 45-60 minutes per day of self-managed lower extremity homework exercises focused on improving strength, balance and walking ability.","armGroupLabels":["LE"],"otherNames":["Inpatient supplementary practice program on lower extremity function"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Leg Management group","description":"Therapist provides educational information about leg pain, recovery, bone density, and fall risk.","armGroupLabels":["LM"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome is gait speed","timeFrame":"4 weeks post-intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The secondary outcomes will assess the effect of the experimental intervention on balance and physical activity","timeFrame":"4 weeks post-baseline, then 6 and 12 months post-stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have been admitted to a hospital unit for stroke treatment\n* 19 years or older\n* Are experiencing difficulty using legs\n* Able to understand and follow instructions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have uncontrolled hypertension or unstable cardio-vascular condition\n* Injuries to muscles, bones, or joints of the leg\n* Unable to verbally speak or understand the investigators when asked questions","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Janice Eng","affiliation":"University of British Columbia","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"William Miller","affiliation":"University of British Columbia","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Andrew Dawson","affiliation":"University of British Columbia","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Penny Brasher","affiliation":"University of British Columbia","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Nanaimo Regional General Hospital","city":"Nanaimo","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":49.16638,"lon":-123.94003}},{"facility":"Eagle Ridge Hospital","city":"Port Moody","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":49.28309,"lon":-122.85279}},{"facility":"GF Strong Rehab Center","city":"Vancouver","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":49.24966,"lon":-123.11934}},{"facility":"Holy Family Hospital","city":"Vancouver","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":49.24966,"lon":-123.11934}},{"facility":"Victoria General Hospital","city":"Victoria","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":48.43294,"lon":-123.3693}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
