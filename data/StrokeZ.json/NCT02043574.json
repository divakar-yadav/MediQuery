The number of strokes is likely to double in the next 50 years. Many stroke survivors are sedentary and have a poor dietary intake, which results in abnormalities in fuel utilization (eg carbohydrate versus fat). This study will examine the effects of dietary modification and treadmill training on fuel utilization and physical function. We will study skeletal muscle oxidative stress in chronic stroke patients and the ability to employ dietary modification and exercise training to reverse these abnormalities in this ethnically diverse population.","detailedDescription":"In acute stroke settings, it is known that energy imbalance is associated with poorer rehabilitation and functional outcomes, and importantly, increased risk of institutionalization. However, nutrition and eating habits of chronic stroke rehabilitative care have received very little consideration, especially if the survivor is living in a free living environment. Studies have shown deficiencies in energy and protein intake versus recommendations in chronic stroke survivors. Perry et al. found \\~7% of chronic stroke survivors were at moderate and \\~5% at high nutritional risk. Although little is known regarding total daily energy expenditure and dietary intake in chronic stroke, energy and macronutrient imbalance may have a profound impact on stroke recovery and risk of development of chronic disease and recurrent stroke by altering substrate oxidation and result in systemic and tissue level oxidative stress. Conversely, cardiovascular disease risk increases with excess calorie and fat intake and two-thirds of stroke survivors are overweight or obese. In obese, non-stroke populations, energy dense, high fat meals are associated with increases in plasma oxidative stress markers. Oxidative stress can lead to mitochondrial damage and abnormal accumulation of metabolite intermediates and lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues, which can impair heart function, increasing CVD and stroke recurrence risk."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Aerobic Exercise","Treadmill Test","Sedentary Lifestyle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Subjects are randomized to either stretching or treadmill training.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stretching (Control)","type":"OTHER","description":"Six months of stretching","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Stretching (control)"]},{"label":"Treadmill Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Six months of treadmill training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Treadmill Exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Treadmill Exercise","description":"Training will be started conservatively with a goal of 15 minutes total duration at 40-50% HRR.
