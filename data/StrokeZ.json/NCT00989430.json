Alternately, a stroke may impair precise visual-spatial hand and body aiming movements. The research team wishes to discover whether prism adaptation treatment (two weeks of daily 20-min sessions of goal-directed movement with prism goggles) affects visual-spatial where or aiming errors selectively after stroke.\n\nThis research represents one of the first attempts to apply what we know about the brain from neuroscience research, to modern clinical rehabilitation practices.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this research study with a randomized controlled design is to examine the effects of prism adaptation treatment on two visual-spatial recovery components.
