Half of the participants will receive a stroke education program while the other half will receive an environmental modifications program.","detailedDescription":"A gap in care exists at the point of transition from inpatient rehabilitation (IR) to home, when survivors encounter new environmental barriers due to the cognitive and sensorimotor sequelae of stroke. Resolving these barriers and improving independence in the community have potential to significantly improve stroke survivors' long-term morbidity. The proposed study investigates the efficacy and safety of a novel enhanced rehabilitation-transition program to reduce environmental barriers and improve daily activity performance and community participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["environmental modifications","activity performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":185,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"COMPASS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"COMPASS is a complex intervention that combines 2 evidence-based treatment strategies at a new point of care (transition from inpatient rehabilitation).
