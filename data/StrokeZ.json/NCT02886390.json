Numerous reports have confirmed it strongest endogenous neuroprotection against brain injury after stroke. Ren et al demonstrated that remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) performed in the hind limbs can not only significantly reduce the stroke volume within 3 hours in rat model, but also ameliorate the outcome of the behavioral test. A long-term repeated RIPC therapy can also help improving neurological functions. A combination of RIPC and tPA can help with neuroprotection which improves the neurological functions. Thus, it is meaningful to transform these basic experimental results to the clinical treatment. In the RECAST-1 trial, RIC has shown it safety and efficiency in AIS patients without tPA. However, there is no further explanation for the patients with IVT. Thus, in this study, we aim to demonstrate the efficiency and safety of RIPC in AIS patients performed rt-PA within 4.5 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["remote ischemic conditioning","r-tPA thrombolytic therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The upper limb ischemic conditioning is composed of five cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia intervened by reperfusion, which is induced by two cuff placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation.
