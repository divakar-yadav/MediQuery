Adults with aphasia/alexia resulting from stroke or traumatic brain injury will undergo baseline behavioral testing of various language and cognitive functions. Subjects who are willing to undergo MRI evaluation will also be scanned. They will then receive five days of either real or sham tDCS with standardized speech-language therapy, under a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design. Behavioral assessments, and MRIs for those participating in the MRI portion of the study, will be performed again at multiple time points after completing tDCS to assess for changes in these measures."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Stroke","Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Neuroplasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"TDCS was applied bilaterally, with the anodal electrode on the left temple and cathodal electrode on the right.
