The MAS scores were distributed across the entire scale, ranging from 0 to 4, that is convenient for the clinician use. The grading of the scale is described as below: 0) no increase in muscle tone; 1) minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion; 1+) slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the reminder (less than half) of the ROM; 2) more marked increase in tone but only after part is easily flexed; 3) considerable increase in tone; and 4) passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension.","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in the result of Box and blocks test","description":"The score is the number of blocks carried from one box to the other in one minute.
