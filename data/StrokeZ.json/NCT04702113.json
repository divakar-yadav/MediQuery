The Lighthouse report (PGx findings) are provided to the clinician, and a notification is generated when the patient has a genotype with a deleterious drug-metabolizing phenotype.\n\nEvaluating the South Texas community for the pilot project will enhance the understanding of the impact of genetic variants on individuals of Hispanic/Latino ancestry, especially as the variants pertain to the efficacy and safety of medications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thrombosis","Stent Thrombosis","Bleeding","Myocardial Infarction","Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stent Thrombosis","Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"There will be two study arms:\n\n1.
