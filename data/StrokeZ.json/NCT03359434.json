monocentric, non-randomized, prospective study in which each patient is his/her own control.\n\nThe study investigates 2 methods of blood pressure measurement, within the first 24 hours after reperfusion, i) Continuous measurement of blood pressure with the Clearsight device (Edwards) and ii) intermittent blood pressure measurements with cuff.","detailedDescription":"Patients will be followed for 72 hours:\n\n* inclusion after reperfusion: clinical evaluation with NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Score) score, measurement of blood pressure.\n* within 24 hours after reperfusion: blood pressure measurements\n* at 24 hours: NIHSS score.\n* Between 24 and 36 hours :cerebral scan (assessment of hemorrhagic transformations and cerebral infarction volumes).\n* 72 hours after reperfusion: brain scanner in case of hyperdensity on the initial scanner"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Blood Pressure","Cerebral Hemorrhage"],"keywords":["Acute
