Therefore a daily intervention of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 8 days combined with subsequent physiotherapy is compared to a control condition, sham stimulation combined with subsequent physiotherapy. Motor function, degree of disability and quality of life are examined in order to evaluate the effects of iTBS in the rehabilitation of recurrent stroke patients in the first weeks and after three months.","detailedDescription":"To date, the majority of neuromodulation approaches aiming at improving motor recovery after stroke are limited to patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. Therefore, rehabilitation of recurrent stroke mainly includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet, particular these patients retain movement impairment relevant for activities of daily living.\n\nBy using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is possible to promote recovery of connectivity between brain regions, particularly after stroke and thereby improve motor performance. Previous data indicate that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a protocol of neuromodulation, enhances the effects of subsequent motor training in early rehabilitation after stroke.\n\nThe current study aims at investigating whether daily repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 8 days combined with subsequent physiotherapy leads to better motor recovery in recurrent stroke, compared to control condition, physiotherapy after sham stimulation. Motor function, degree of disability and quality of life are examined in order to evaluate the effects of iTBS in the rehabilitation of recurrent stroke patients in the first weeks and after three months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Neurorehabilitation"],"keywords":["Recurrent stroke","Stroke","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Theta-Burst-Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real-iTBS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Magstim Super Rapid2 System"]},{"label":"Sham-iTBS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Magstim Super Rapid2 System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magstim Super Rapid2 System","description":"Intermittent theta-burst-stimulation (iTBS) protocol","armGroupLabels":["Real-iTBS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magstim Super Rapid2 System","description":"Sham stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Sham-iTBS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relative grip force","description":"grip force as measured with vigorimeter","timeFrame":"3 months after enrollment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relative grip force","description":"Grip force as measured with vigorimeter","timeFrame":"After 8 days of intervention, and 3 months of enrollment"},{"measure":"Motor function","description":"Action Research Arm Test, ARAT","timeFrame":"After 8 days of intervention, and 3 months of enrollment"},{"measure":"Motor function","description":"Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale of the upper extremity, FM The Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale is an ordinal scale that has 3 points for each item.
