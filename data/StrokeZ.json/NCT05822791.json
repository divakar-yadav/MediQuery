It is unclear if AF detected on 12-lead ECG after stroke occurrence bears the same risk of stroke as Device-detected AF. The investigators hypothesize, that Device-detected AF has a lower risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. The investigators will conduct a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive patients enrolled in the London Ontario Stroke Registry, (Ontario, Canada). The primary outcome will be a recurrent ischemic stroke at the end of the available follow-up window. The investigators will include ischemic stroke and TIA patients with ECG-detected AF and those with Device-detected AF on at least 7 days of Holter monitoring."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Atrial Fibrillation","TIA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":366,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ECG-Detected AF","description":"Patients with atrial fibrillation detected on 12-lead ECGs done post-stroke","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: ECG"]},{"label":"Device-Detected AF","description":"Patients with atrial fibrillation detected on prolonged Holter monitoring lasting at least 7 days.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Prolonged cardiac monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Prolonged cardiac monitoring","description":"Prolonged cardiac monitoring","armGroupLabels":["Device-Detected AF"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"ECG","description":"Electrocardiogram","armGroupLabels":["ECG-Detected AF"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with Recurrent Ischemic Stroke at End of available Follow-up Time","description":"Documented recurrent ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up - minimum of 3 months after the first encounter with the stroke team"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Death","description":"Number of patients dead at the end of the available follow-up","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up - minimum of 3 months after the first encounter with the stroke team"},{"measure":"Readmission for decompensated AF or heart failure","description":"Prevalence of readmission for decompensated AF or heart failure (HF) in each group","timeFrame":"Duration of follow-up - minimum of 3 months after the first encounter with the stroke team"},{"measure":"Prevalence of risk factors, cardiovascular comorbidities, and structural heart disease","description":"Proportion with vascular risk factors, cardiovascular comorbidities, and structural heart disease in each group","timeFrame":"Documented at baseline."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥18 years\n* Patient with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA.\n* ECG-diagnosed AF or PCM-detected AF post ischemic stroke or TIA\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals younger than18 years-old\n* Patients without IS or TIA diagnosis","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with an acute ischemic stroke or TIA in the London Ontario Stroke Registry without known AF, who are newly diagnosed with AF on a 12-lead ECG or a ≥7-day external cardiac monitor.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Luciano Sposato, MD, MBA (PI)","affiliation":"London Health Sciences Centre, Western University (London, ON.
