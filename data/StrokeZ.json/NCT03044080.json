Equinovarus foot, with or without claw toes and striatal foot, is especially common. There is a weak to moderate evidence in favor of the use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in the equinovarus foot, stiff-knee and in other patterns that may interfere with gait ability. Specifically, BoNT/A increases walking speed in stroke patients with spastic equinovarus foot.\n\nRepeated use of BoNT/A may lead to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies, so its effect may decrease over successive infiltrations. Among the differential characteristics of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) there is a reduced inactivated botulinum neurotoxin content and the lack of complexing proteins, which would diminish antigenicity and not suppose a decrease of the effect before successive infiltrations.\n\nThe objective of this project is to determine the effect on walking speed of repeated use of BoNT/A in post-stroke spinal equinovarus foot in three consecutive injections at 6-month intervals and to investigate whether the sustainability of the effect is greater in incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) than in onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®). All patients will receive 200-300 units of BoNT/A (Xeomin ® or Botox ®) that will be distributed according to the individual clinical pattern of spastic equinovarus foot."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation","Stroke Rehabilitation Spasticity Management"],"keywords":["Walking Disorder","Stroke","Botulinum Toxin","Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IncobotulinumtoxinA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Injection of 200-300 units of IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin ®)","interventionNames":["Drug: IncobotulinumtoxinA"]},{"label":"OnabotulinumtoxinA","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Injection of 200-300 units of onabotulinumtoxiA (Botox®)","interventionNames":["Drug: OnabotulinumtoxinA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"IncobotulinumtoxinA","description":"Three consecutive injections of 200-300 units of IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin ®) under ultrasound guidance.
