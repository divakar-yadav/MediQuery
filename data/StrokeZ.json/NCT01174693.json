Clopidogrel must be converted into an active metabolite in order to show anti-platelet activity. Hepatic CYP2C19 enzyme is one of the key hepatic enzymes which convert clopidogrel into active metabolite and its genetic polymorphism is related to clopidogrel resistance. CYP2C19 poor or intermediate metabolizer groups show reduced anti-platelet activity of clopidogrel compared to extensive metabolizer group.\n\nThis study is designed to prove the superiority of the triflusal in preventing recurrent stroke over the clopidogrel in ischemic stroke patient with poor or intermediate metabolizer of CYP2C19 polymorphism. Also we plan to prove that clopidogrel resistance is related to CYP2C19 polymorphism by comparing the ischemic preventive effect of clopidogrel between groups of different CYP2C19 polymorphism."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["prospective","randomized","open label","multi-center","double-blind for CYP2C19 genotypes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":795,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Clopidogrel","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Plavix® 75mg tablet, 75mg once daily, Mode of administration: oral, Duration: from randomization to 31 December 2014","interventionNames":["Drug: Clopidogrel"]},{"label":"Triflusal","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Disgre® 150mg or 300mg capsule, 300mg bid, Mode of administration: oral, Duration: from randomization to 31 December 2014","interventionNames":["Drug: Triflusal"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Triflusal","description":"Dose: 150mg or 300mg capsule, 300mg bid, Mode of administration: oral, Duration: from randomization to 31 December 2014","armGroupLabels":["Triflusal"],"otherNames":["Disgren®"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Clopidogrel","description":"Dose: 75mg tablet, 75mg once daily, Mode of administration: oral, Duration: from randomization to 31 December 2014","armGroupLabels":["Clopidogrel"],"otherNames":["Plavix®"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to first recurrent stroke","description":"The study will finish at least 2 years after the recruit of 1080th patients.
