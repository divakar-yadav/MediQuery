In the GDT group, haemodynamic information will be obtained by a flow monitoring device coupled with standard heart rate and blood pressure monitoring.","detailedDescription":"The rationale of minimizing body weight gain and avoiding unnecessary fluid compensation of the \"third compartment\" is now well justified and achievement of supra-normal oxygen delivery values is likely not necessary in most surgical patients. Therefore,it would be tempting to adopt fluid restriction protocols given the potentials of better wound healing, faster return of bowel function and shorter hospital stay after major surgical procedures.\n\nAlthough dynamic flow indices of volume responsiveness have been validated in critically-ill patients, concerns have been raised regarding the risk of overzealous fluid administration in non-critically-ill patients undergoing elective surgery.\n\nTo date, RCTs comparing fluid regimen (\"liberal\" versus \"restrictive\" or \"liberal\" versus \"GDT\") have yielded controversial results with no consensus regarding appropriate fluid administration in the perioperative period. Interestingly, restrictive protocols have been associated with more frequent adverse events (e.g., nausea, vomiting) following minor surgical procedures and concerns have been raised regarding the possibility of tissue hypoperfusion leading to end-organ dysfunction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Complication, Postoperative"],"keywords":["operative mortality","myocardial infarct, arrhythmia, heart failure, stroke","pneumonia, atelectasis, acute lung injury","surgical site infection","acute kidney injury","body weight"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Patients, clinical care givers and assessors are blinded to the the treatment (GDT or restrictive).\n\nSealed enveloppes contain the patient' identification number.
