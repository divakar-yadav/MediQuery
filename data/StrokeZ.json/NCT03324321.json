An Autoregulation Index (ARI) can be assigned between 0 and 9 (0 being poor and 9 being the most efficient CA observed) to gauge how good the control over blood flow is at a given time. Dynamic CA (dCA) is a measure of the response of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to rapid changes in blood pressure (BP), and several key studies have shown impaired dCA post-acute ICH. The most recent study demonstrated that dCA impairment lasts up to 12 days. This is particularly important to understand, since our preliminary work has recently shown that changes in carbon dioxide using simple breathing exercises can improve Autoregulation.\n\nUnfortunately, there are limited non-pharmacological management options and significant opportunities to improve patient outcome in ICH. The proposed study addresses this area, by investigating whether a simple breathing exercise in survivors of ICH is safe, feasible and effective in reducing brain injury by improving cerebral autoregulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Hemorrhage","Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage","Blood Pressure"],"keywords":["Cerebral Haemodynamics","Carbon Dioxide","Cerebral Autoregulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single-centre, prospective, before and after study","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hyperventilation Protocol","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This will involve sustained periods of 90-seconds of hyperventilation at two levels (-5mmHg and -10mmHg below baseline EtCO2) to a maximum lower level threshold of EtCO2 24mmHg/CBFV 33cm/s regulated using a metronome.
