Re-establishing normal movement patterns is an essential part of rehabilitation; however, achievement of this typically requires thousands of accurate movement repetitions. Only through this repetition can a person benefit from the inherent neuroplasticity of the nervous system to make restored patterns habitual.\n\nSensory and/or proprioceptive problems may limit a person's awareness of ways in which abnormal movement patterns differ from desired ones. Because of these problems, provision of external feedback in the form of verbal comments, physical repositioning of the limbs by another person, or other auditory or haptic cues is critical. As a general rule, a person benefits most when provided with precise feedback about the position of body parts when he/she is actively engaged in performing a desired movement. As such, the linking of motion sensors programmed to detect achievement of a target position with immediate auditory (i.e., beeps) and/or haptic (i.e., vibrations) feedback has the potential to be a powerful treatment tool.\n\nThe Kinesthetic Awareness Training (KAT) device developed by PantherTec is a wearable, motion capture system that can be programmed to detect and provide immediate auditory and/or haptic feedback when a person moves a specified body part to a target position during performance of a functional sequence of movements. Each time a person replicates the desired movement, the device either begins emitting or ceases emitting beeps and/or vibrations-as specified during programming-to indicate achievement of the correct position. Adjustment of the sensitivity (i.e., margin of error per target value) allows for specification of how close a performed movement must be to the target position to elicit feedback.\n\nPantherTec has made a prototype of the KAT device available to Quality Living, Inc. (QLI) for feasibility testing and exploration of possible applications with people with movement impairments resulting from acquired neurological injury. The purpose of the proposed case studies is to determine the efficacy of the KAT device in facilitating the restoration of desired movement patterns when people with acquired central nervous system damage perform functional activities such as walking, transitioning from one position to another, or reaching with the arms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injuries","Stroke","Acquired Brain Injury","Movement Disorders"],"keywords":["efficacy","Treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"People with movement disorders","description":"Adults with acquired movement disorders secondary to neurological injury.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Kinesthetic Awareness Training"]},{"label":"Professionals","description":"Professionals providing physical or occupational therapy to participants with acquired movements disorders.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Provision of KAT-assisted physical or occupational therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Kinesthetic Awareness Training","description":"One physical or occupational therapy session per week for 8 weeks during which the participant with disordered movement will attempt to perform desired movements while wearing the KAT device","armGroupLabels":["People with movement disorders"],"otherNames":["KAT"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Provision of KAT-assisted physical or occupational therapy","description":"Physical or occupational therapy professionals will provide one KAT-assisted therapy session per week for 8 weeks to one or more participants with movement disorder.","armGroupLabels":["Professionals"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) in rehabilitation","description":"The GAS uses a 5-point rating scale to describe the extent of a participant's goal achievement.
