The investigators hypothesized that low-intensity warfarin (INR 1.5-2.0) has the same effectiveness and better security in elderly patients (\\>75) with NVAF.","detailedDescription":"Atrial fibrillation is the commonest chronic arrhythmia in clinical practice, especially in octogenarians. Nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke by approximately 5-fold and these strokes result in higher mortality and disability. Warfarin is recommended as ﬁrst line anticoagulation treatment in patients with NVAF who are at moderate or high risk of stroke,while antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin, give a more convenient but less effective alternative in the prevention of ischemic stroke and are recommended in low risk patients.Current guideline about warfarin anticoagulation therapy recommend that target INR value must be maintained between 2.0 and 3.0,which not only reduces the frequency of ischaemic stroke but also its low incidence of major bleeding. However, the current status of anticoagulation therapy for elderly Chinese AF patients, particularly in aged over 80 years, is not clear. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an INR target of 1.5-2.0 can provide the same efficacy and better safety as compare with a standard target of 2.0-3.0 in patients over 75 with NVAF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial ﬁbrillation","stroke","warfarin","aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":260,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"standard intensity warfarin group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Eligible 80 patients(83.14±4.05,33.0%)with chronic NVAF were randomly assigned to this group and the target international normalised ratio(INR) was 2.1-3.0","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]},{"label":"low intensity warfarin group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Eligible 81 patients(84.0±4.71,33.5%)with chronic NVAF were randomly assigned to this group and the target international normalised ratio(INR) was 1.5-2.0","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]},{"label":"aspirin group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Eligible 81 patients(83.4±5.13,33.5%)with chronic NVAF were randomly assigned to this group and 100mg aspirin was administrated every day","interventionNames":["Drug: aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin","description":"Patients randomised to receive warfarin were initiated on treatment at the baseline dose of 1.25mg daily and then gradually increase the amount to the target INR range.","armGroupLabels":["low intensity warfarin group","standard intensity warfarin group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"aspirin","description":"100mg aspirin was administrated every day","armGroupLabels":["aspirin group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"major haemorrhage","description":"Major haemorrhage was defined as intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding requiring hospitalization and surgical intervention, a reduction of hemoglobin by≥2 g/dL, requiring red blood cells transfusion ≥2 units.\n\nFollow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months.
