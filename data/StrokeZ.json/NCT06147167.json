The key inquiries addressed in this study encompass:\n\nEnhancement of Upper Limb Function: The primary investigation seeks to determine whether individualized iTBS yields superior improvements in upper limb functionality compared to standard iTBS.\n\nLong-Term Effects: This study endeavors to explore the sustained effects of both individualized and standard iTBS on upper limb function over an extended duration.\n\nNeural Mechanisms Investigation: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be employed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of iTBS on the enhancement of upper limb function.\n\nPost-stroke individuals with upper limb impairment will undergo pre-treatment assessments, including motor function evaluations and fNIRS tests. Subsequently, they will be randomized into three groups: individualized iTBS, standard iTBS, and sham stimulation. Participants will undergo post-treatment assessments and follow-up evaluations.\n\nThe research team aims to discern disparities in the efficacy of different iTBS modalities. The central hypothesis posits that individualized iTBS will demonstrate superior efficacy in enhancing post-stroke upper limb function, with sustained effects persisting for a minimum of one month.","detailedDescription":"This research constitutes a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled study. Upon enrollment, baseline information is established through the assessment of upper limb function using the Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA), the modified Rankin Scale, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and a handgrip test. Additionally, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is employed to assess brain function, providing insights into the patient's motor network.\n\nParticipants in the study are randomly assigned to one of three groups: individualized iTBS, standard iTBS, and sham stimulation. All participants undergo physical therapy and occupational therapy tailored to their functional evaluation. After three weeks of treatment, participants are required to complete the aforementioned assessments, with a follow-up evaluation scheduled one month post-treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Paresis","Stroke"],"keywords":["intermittent theta burst stimulation;","upper extremity paresis;","functional nearinfrared spectroscopy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":159,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"indvidualized iTBS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In this arm of the study, participants undergo individualized intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) subsequent to encephalography (EEG) testing.
