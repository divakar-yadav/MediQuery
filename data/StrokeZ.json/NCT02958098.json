Individuals under the age of 50 who meet eligibility criteria will answer questions using the American Heart Association's (AHA) Life's Simple 7™ My Life Check v4.0 three times over the course of 6 months and transmit data from a Fitbit Charge 2 device. All other individuals who are interested in the study and meet entry criteria may also enroll.","detailedDescription":"2,000 Participant My Research Legacy Pilot Study\n\n1. Day 0 - Enroll online, complete AHA's Life's Simple 7™ Survey Prospective participants will enroll in the research initiative via the My Research Legacy website (MyResearchLegacy.org). They will go through an online process in which they will answer brief, pre-qualifying questions before consenting to participate in the study.\n\n   * Participants will attest to their age and US residence, and will provide a self-reported diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, aortic dissection, systolic congestive heart failure/cardiomyopathy) and/or stroke.\n   * Eligible participants will read and sign an online consent form.\n   * Within the participant console, the participants will answer AHA's Life's Simple 7™ My Life Check v4.0 assessment.\n   * Participants will be asked during the consent process if they will consent to provide medical records relevant to their diagnosis.\n2. Day 90 Complete AHA's Life's Simple 7™ My Life Check v4.0 assessment; Start transmission from the Fitbit Charge 2.\n3. Online Survey and contact Day 180 after enrollment, participants will receive an email requesting that they visit the participant console to repeat AHA's Life's Simple 7™ My Life Check v4.0 survey. Participants also have the option of determining whether or not they want to be contacted for future studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Cardiomyopathy, Dilated","Systolic Heart Failure","Atrial Fibrillation","Aortic Dissection"],"keywords":["myocardial infarction","stroke","dilated cardiomyopathy","systolic heart failure","atrial fibrillation","aortic dissection","wearable devices","genomic sequencing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2267,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Myocardial infarction","description":"Individuals with myocardial infarction before age 50 years."},{"label":"Stroke","description":"Individuals with stroke before age 50 years"},{"label":"Aortic dissection","description":"Individuals with aortic dissection before age 50 years"},{"label":"Systolic heart failure","description":"Individuals with systolic heart failure/dilated cardiomyopathy before age 50 years."},{"label":"Atrial fibrillation","description":"Individuals with atrial fibrillation before age 50 years"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"study retention","description":"continues to engage with study after 6 months","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in answers to AHA's Life's Simple 7™ My Life Check v4.0","description":"answers to second and other surveys","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Duration of time Fitbit Charge 2 used by participants","description":"recorded time","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Change in Fitbit Charge 2 step count","description":"recorded steps","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Percent of individuals that initiate but don't complete online process","description":"number that start but don't finish first surveys","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Activity duration","description":"Daily, weekly, monthly activity from Fitbit Charge 2","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
