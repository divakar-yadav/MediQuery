Patients with acute cerebral infarcts within the middle cerebral arterial territory and with severe neurological deficits will be enrolled and randomly allocated into 3 groups: autologous BMSCs transplantation group, autologous EPCs transplantation group and Placebo control group. Randomization codes were established by the study statistician and were revealed only to the stem cell laboratory technician responsible for separating the cells into aliquots or preparing the placebo material. All patients will undergo a Bone Marrow aspiration procedure at 7 days after symptom onset. BMSCs and EPCs will be expanded ex vivo and then intravenously infused into own body, respectively. The control group will not receive cell therapy. Observe will followed for up to 1 year after the onset. Neurological score, neuroimaging, mortality of any cause, side effects, and new-onset comorbidities will be monitored and compared between each groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"],"keywords":["Central Nervous System Diseases","Stroke","Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Accident","Stem Cell Transplantation","Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation","Bone marrow stromal cells","Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Endothelial progenitor cells","Adult Stem Cells","Cell Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BMSCs group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Genetic: Autologous BMSCs transplantation"]},{"label":"EPCs group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Genetic: Autologous EPCs transplantation"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Genetic: IV infusion of placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Autologous BMSCs transplantation","description":"The first transplantation: 2.5 million cells per kg autologous BMSCs suspended in 100 ml saline plus 5% autologous serum are infused intravenously approximately 4 weeks after bone marrow aspiration.\n\nThe second transplantation: the same amount of cells are again transplanted approximately 1 weeks after initial boosting.","armGroupLabels":["BMSCs group"],"otherNames":["Autologous Bone marrow stromal cells transplantation","Autologous Mesenchymal stem cells transplantation"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"Autologous EPCs transplantation","description":"The first transplantation: 2.5 million cells per kg autologous EPCs suspended in 100 ml saline plus 5% autologous serum are infused intravenously approximately 4 weeks after bone marrow aspiration.\n\nThe second transplantation: the same amount of cells are again transplanted approximately 1 weeks after initial boosting.","armGroupLabels":["EPCs group"],"otherNames":["Autologous endothelial progenitor cells transplantation"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"IV infusion of placebo","description":"IV infusion of saline plus 5% autologous serum.","armGroupLabels":["Control group"],"otherNames":["Placebo control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of adverse events after infusion of BMSCs or EPCs.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in functional outcomes measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Barthel index (BI).","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
