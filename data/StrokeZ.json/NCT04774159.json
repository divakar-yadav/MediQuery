The sample size for the vanguard phase is 150 patients over 1-year accrual with a 1-year follow-up.The primary outcome is the feasibility of recruitment. If feasibility is demonstrated, patients from the vanguard phase will be rolled over into the full multicenter trial if there are no major protocol modifications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Peripheral Arterial Disease","Atherosclerosis of Extremities","Inflammation"],"keywords":["Acute limb ischemia","Myocardial Infarction","Stroke","Cardiovascular death","Mortality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind and use of similarly active and placebo tablets.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Colchicine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Colchicine 0.5mg daily for the duration of the trial","interventionNames":["Drug: Colchicine 0.5 MG Oral Tablet"]},{"label":"Colchicine-Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Colchicine-Placebo daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Colchicine-Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Colchicine 0.5 MG Oral Tablet","description":"Colchicine 0.5 mg tablet daily\n\nActive drug and placebo are of the same appearance and are indistinguishable.
