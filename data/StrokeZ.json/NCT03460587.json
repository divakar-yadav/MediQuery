Stroke is truly a chronic disease, with survivors living for years or decades after the event. Increasing evidence describes years of steady decline in several health measures for stroke survivors. Many factors contribute to this, including further strokes, uncontrolled risk factors, development of late complications of stroke, and limited access to rehabilitation therapy.\n\nNew approaches are needed that address the many needs of stroke survivors, efficiently and in aggregate. Emerging telehealth technologies have high potential to address this major unmet need, but substantial innovation will be needed. The long-term goal is to establish a telehealth platform to treat chronic stroke.\n\nA telehealth system will be delivered to enrollee's home. Patients will be asked to interact with their system daily (at least 6 days/wk) for 12 weeks. For 3 times per week, during the first 2 weeks, and then 1 time per week thereafter, a study therapist or research assistant in the lab will use the telehealth system to have a videoconference with the subject, to answer questions, provide feedback, review progress, and make any changes needed in the therapy plan. Study personnel will monitor usage statistics and performance measures for all systems.\n\nA key strategy is to measure in parallel, patient behaviors in three categories of health issues central to chronic stroke: (1) medical management issues including risk factor knowledge and control, (2) disability issues including motor function, and (3) psychological issues including depression and anxiety."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Vascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home-based Telerehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home-based Telerehabilitation","interventionNames":["Device: Telerehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Telerehabilitation","description":"The Telerehabilitation system will deliver rehabilitation treatment sessions via an in-home internet-connected computer.
