The new European guidelines recommend that anticoagulation should be started already before cardioversion in all patients with CHADS2VASC score indicating need for long-term oral anticoagulation. The evidence behind these guidelines is, however, scarce. In this retrospective study we collect data on the safety of acute AF cardioversion from emergency rooms of two university hospitals and one secondary referral center from the years 2003-2010.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAll patients admitted to emergency room because of acute AF in whom electrical or pharmacological cardioversion was attempted \\<48 from the beginning of the symptoms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cardioversion","stroke","thromboembolism"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7700,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence and predictors of thromboembolic complications, especially stroke, and death <31 days after cardioversion of acute AF","timeFrame":"31 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of therapy non-responder and early recurrence of AF","timeFrame":"31 days"},{"measure":"Bleeding complications during the 31 days follow-up","timeFrame":"31 days"},{"measure":"Hemodynamic complications of cardioversion","timeFrame":"31 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients admitted to emergency room because of acute AF in whom electrical or pharmacological cardioversion was attempted \\<48 from the beginning of the symptoms\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* duration of the AF is unknown or \\>48 hours","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All patients admitted to emergency room because of acute AF in whom electrical or pharmacological cardioversion was attempted \\<48 from the beginning of the symptoms.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Juhani Airaksinen, Professor","affiliation":"Turku University Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kuopio University Hospital","city":"Kuopio","zip":"70211","country":"Finland","geoPoint":{"lat":62.89238,"lon":27.67703}},{"facility":"Satakunta Central Hospital","city":"Pori","zip":"28500","country":"Finland","geoPoint":{"lat":61.48333,"lon":21.78333}},{"facility":"Turku University Hospital","city":"Turku","zip":"20520","country":"Finland","geoPoint":{"lat":60.45148,"lon":22.26869}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"32646574","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Jaakkola S, Nuotio I, Hartikainen JEK, Airaksinen KEJ.
