Sensor-based technologies may be useful for falls prevention and balance recovery during patients hospitalization. OAK Elderly Care System (Khymeia Group, Noventa Padovana, Italy) allows the assessment of fall risk, the centre of pressure and the execution of balance exercises in a virtual environment.","detailedDescription":"The aim of the study is to compare the therapy provided by means of the OAK Elderly Care System with conventional physiotherapy for balance rehabilitation in patients affected by stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson Disease (PD).\n\nOAK Elderly Care System consists of two independent balance boards and three sensors for the kinematic tracking of the trunk and lower limbs. These components allow the assessment of the centre of pressure and the execution of exercises in a virtual environment.\n\n120 patients (40 stroke, 40 MS, 40 PK) hospitalized at 4 different italian hospitals, were enrolled according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomly assigned to two groups (i.e. intervention group, control group). Intervention group received 1 daily hour of technology-based treatment, while the control group underwent 1 daily hour of physiotherapy for balance rehabilitation, in addiction to 1 hour of conventional physiotherapy. Both treatments lasted 15 sessions. Before and after treatment balance, walking, daily living autonomy and pathology-specific features were assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson Disease"],"keywords":["Balance","Sensor-based rehabilitation","Virtual Reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The experimental group is treated through a sensor-based devices in a virtual environment, while the control group is treated through conventional physiotherapy for balance rehabilitation","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group (EG)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the EG the subjects will perform balance exercises using the OAK system under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist.
