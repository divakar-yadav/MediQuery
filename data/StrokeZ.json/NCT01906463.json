Indeed in coming decades, the expected doubling of the population of persons aged over 60 years and the foreseeable changes in lifestyle will increase the burden of this disease, in particular since the region is marked by a high prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes and a high level of precarity. In addition, this study will provide epidemiological information on CVA, its risk factors and management, which are non-existent for the department of French Guyana where the health environment is manifestly insufficient. These data should make it possible to better evaluate the resources available and the healthcare needs in Guyana."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Symptomatic CVA (de Novo CVA)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1612,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Medical history","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Follow-up questionnaire: functional handicap, intercurrent hospitalisation, vital status","timeFrame":"Month 6"},{"measure":"Follow-up questionnaire: functional handicap, intercurrent hospitalisation, vital status","timeFrame":"Month 1"},{"measure":"Follow-up questionnaire: functional handicap, intercurrent hospitalisation, vital status","timeFrame":"Month 12"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pre- inclusion\n* Patients who have received information about the study (directly or via a person of trust),\n* Patients aged more than 18 years,\n* Patient hospitalised for a suspected first symptomatic CVA (whatever the mechanism), preceded or not by a transient ischemic attack (TIA),\n* Patients with a cerebral imaging examination (CT-scan and/or MRI),\n* in Guyana, suspicion of a first CVA according to WHO clinical criteria and who died before the authorised images for descriptive purposes,\n* Patients able to answer questions personally or through a parent or a person of trust.\n\nDefinitive inclusion\n\n- Patients with confirmed CVA diagnosed according to clinical criteria (WHO criteria) and imaging criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* - Patients who refuse to take part in the study,\n* Patients with prior symptomatic CVA,\n* Patients without cerebral imaging (except in Guyana, for patients with suspected CVA who died before imaging),\n* Patients with another severe evolutive disease that could cause death in the weeks following the CVA,\n* Patients who cannot be contacted by telephone at 1 month.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient from CHU Dijon , CHU Point-à-Pitre and CHU Fort-de-France,CHU Guyane","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de Dijon","city":"Dijon","zip":"21079","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
