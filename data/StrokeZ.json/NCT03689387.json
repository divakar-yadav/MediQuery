It brings many benefits after stroke, particularly in terms of secondary prevention by reducing modifiable risk factors, cardio-respiratory capacity, and neuromotive, cognitive and functional recovery by stimulating brain plasticity (Saunders et al., 2014).\n\nThe Stroke Council of the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends, in prevention after the occurrence of a first stroke, the practice of moderate to intense physical activity for 40 minutes a day, three to four times a week (Lackland et al., 2014).
