Although physical rehabilitation helps a little with the improvement of walking ability, recovery is usually incomplete. The purpose of this study is to explore how two different treadmill training approaches influence walking speed, symmetry, and balance in people with chronic severe stroke-related walking impairment. The two approaches involve either forward or backwards treadmill training. This study will look at changes in walking performance and balance, before and after training. This study may lead to more efficient methods for improving walking performance and balance after stroke.","detailedDescription":"Severe walking impairment after stroke is defined as the inability to walk faster than 0.4 meters per second and impacts nearly twenty-five percent of chronic stroke survivors. Walking speed is a key determiner of community independence, and stroke survivors classified as \"severe\" are more often symptomatically home-bound with limited mobility and are at higher risk of falls, fractures, and rehospitalizations. A recent study by the investigators suggests that backward locomotion treadmill training (BLTT) may be a promising rehabilitative approach in stroke survivors with severe walking impairment; however, the effect of training duration on behavioral outcomes is unknown.\n\nThe objective of this study is to obtain critical pilot data on the effects of extended BLTT on walking speed, symmetry, and balance (static and dynamic), in chronic stroke survivors with baseline severe walking impairment, relative to forward treadmill training controls (FLTT).\n\nAim 1. Determine the training-related effects of extended BLTT on overground walking speed (primary outcome) in survivors with severe walking impairment. To achieve this aim, we will compare the Pre-Post change in walking speed \\[10- meter walk test (10MWT)\\] between groups. The working hypothesis is that extended BLTT will increase walking speed to a clinically meaningful level (â‰¥0.16m/s), compared to the control group (FLTT).\n\nAim 2. Determine the effects of extended BLTT on walking symmetry and balance. The Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis software will capture Pre-Post changes in temporal gait symmetry index during the 10-MWT. Working hypothesis 2a: BLTT will be associated with a favorable improvement in the temporal symmetry index score. Proprioception and spinovestibular function will be measured with the modified Sensorineural Integration Test (mSIT), and dynamic balance will be assessed with the completion time on the instrumented Timed Up \\& Go (i- TUG). Working hypothesis 2b and c: BLTT will be associated with a favorable improvement Pre-Post mSIT(a) and completion time on the i-TUG (b)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Chronic Stroke","Walking, Difficulty","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["Gait","Balance","Non-body weight supported treadmill training","Backward locomotion treadmill training","Forward locomotion treadmill training","Walking Rehabilitation","Walking Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Stratified Randomization","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single (Outcomes Assessor)","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Backward Locomotion Treadmill Training (BLTT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants train on a reverse treadmill (no bodyweight support), three times per week x 4 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Backward Locomotion Treadmill Training (BLTT)"]},{"label":"Forward Locomotion Treadmill Training (FLTT)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants train on a treadmill (no bodyweight support), three times per week x 4 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Forward Locomotion Treadmill Training (FLTT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Backward Locomotion Treadmill Training (BLTT)","description":"12-training sessions of reverse treadmill training (no bodyweight support) over four weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Backward Locomotion Treadmill Training (BLTT)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Forward Locomotion Treadmill Training (FLTT)","description":"12-training sessions of forward treadmill training (no bodyweight support) over tfour weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Forward Locomotion Treadmill Training (FLTT)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in 10-Meter Walk (fast)","description":"Two 10MWT trials (using a stop-watch) are averaged and documented in meters/second.","timeFrame":"Pre-Baseline (Day of Randomization) to One Day Post-Training"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"10-Meter Walk Test (Fast- Retention)","description":"Two 10MWT (fast) trials (using a stop-watch) are averaged and documented in meters/second.","timeFrame":"One Day Post Training, One month Post Training, 3- Months Post Training"},{"measure":"10-Meter Walk (Comfortable)","description":"Two 10MWT trials (using a stop-watch) are averaged and documented in meters/second.","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day of Randomization), One Day Post-Training, One month Post Training, 3-Months Post Training"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Temporal Symmetry Index","description":"%-limb support of the affected and unaffected leg, during the 10 MWT","timeFrame":"Temporal Symmetry Index"},{"measure":"Static Balance: Sway Index (SI)","description":"The Biodex Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mSIBT) is a well-validated balance system and has been used neurally intact and neurologically impaired individuals to objectively measure static balance.
