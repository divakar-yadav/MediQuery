Thus, data of patients under effective treatment with rivaroxaban or apixaban and treated with andexanet alfa at baseline will be assessed at the time of onset of ICH, during the hospital stay and during a follow-up by telephone at 30 and 90 days after hospital discharge.\n\nThe main objective is defined as the change in size or volume of the hematoma by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with ICH under effective treatment with rivaroxaban and apixaban, who are treated with andexanet alfa. Further objectives comprise evaluations concerning the functional status according to modified Rankin Scale (mRS), changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and occurrences of ICH or new intraventricular bleeding as well as mortality rates."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Hemorrhages"],"keywords":["Intracranial bleeding","Andexanet-alfa","Rivaroxaban","Apixaban","Anticoagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient group","description":"Patients under effective anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or apixaban and treated with andexanet alfa"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in size (specified as ml or cm^3) of the intracranial bleeding evaluated by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","description":"The primary endpoint is the change in size (specified as ml or cm\\^3) of the intracranial bleeding evaluated by first CT or MRI between 12-72 hours after initial CT or MRI; further imaging in case of worsened health condition","timeFrame":"12-72 hours after initial CT or MRI, further imaging in case of worsened health condition"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional status according to modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"Functional status acc. to modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before ICH, at admission, at discharge, after 30 days, and after 90 days.
