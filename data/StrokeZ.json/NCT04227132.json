Recent data show that the execution of concurrent tasks (that is, multitasking) can worsen the clinical condition and impact functional recovery.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an adaptive computer game \"Labyrinth\" previously validated on health population. The videogame is designed for training both attention and execution functions as it engages spatial navigation and multitasking. The effect of the computer game will be compared to standard computerized exercises used for neglect rehabilitation.\n\nThe investigators plan to administer to a sample of 30 stroke patients with SN both Labyrinth and standard trainings for 10 sessions each. The two trainings will be delivered in a randomized crossover design. Improvements of patients' performance will be registered across trainings and in a follow-up test at 1 month, by assessing the severity of SN and functional everyday outcomes. The investigators expect that patients' performance will improve following both types of training, but with stronger improvement for the adaptive videogame."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spatial Neglect","Neglect, Hemispatial","Attention Impaired","Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Neglect","Recovery of function","Rehabilitation","Videogame","Post-stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Both experimental and control trainings will be administered consecutively to all patients.
