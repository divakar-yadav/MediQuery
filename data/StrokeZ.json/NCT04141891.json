This multi-site trial will (1) test the driving decision aid (DDA) in improving decision making and quality (knowledge, decision conflict, values concordance and behavior intent); and (2) determine its effects on specific subpopulations of older drivers (stratified for cognitive function, decisional capacity, and attitudinally readiness for a mobility transition). The overarching hypotheses are that the DDA will help older adults make high-quality decisions, which will mitigate the negative psychosocial impacts of driving reduction, and that optimal DDA use will target certain populations and settings.","detailedDescription":"The investigators will use a multi-site, two-armed randomized controlled trial of older drivers (n=300; ≥70 years) from clinical settings, and one family member each (n=up to 300), with longitudinal follow-up. Study goals are to test how much the DDA improves outcomes and identify who benefits most from the DDA. Evaluation of the DDA's efficacy (Aim 1) and its relative effect in subgroups (Aim 2) corresponds to Stage II in the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development. Findings from Aims 1 \\& 2 could identify necessary refinements (Stage I) and inform future efficacy, effectiveness or implementation trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Retinopathy","Macular Degeneration","Glaucoma","Retinitis Pigmentosa","Vision Disorders","Acute Coronary Syndrome","Implantable Defibrillator User","Congestive Heart Failure","Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy","Orthostatic Hypotension","Syncope","Presyncope","Narcolepsy","Dementia","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson Disease","Brain Injuries","Spinal Cord Injuries","Stroke","Vertigo","Dizziness","Seizures","Substance Use","Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus","Arthritis","Foot--Abnormalities","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Obstructive Sleep Apnea","End Stage Renal Disease","Sleep Apnea","Insomnia","Restless Legs Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":530,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Driving Decision Aid","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Web-based Driving Decision Aid","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Driving Decision Aid"]},{"label":"Older Drivers Website","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"National Institute on Aging (NIA) Older Drivers website","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Older Drivers Website"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Driving Decision Aid","description":"Healthwise DDA","armGroupLabels":["Driving Decision Aid"],"otherNames":["DDA"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Older Drivers Website","description":"National Institute on Aging (NIA) Older Drivers Website","armGroupLabels":["Older Drivers Website"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) Scores at Day 0 (Post-intervention)","description":"The DCS is a 16-item scale (with Likert scale response options) that has high reliability and test-retest correlation (Cronbach's alpha coefficients \\> 0.78).
