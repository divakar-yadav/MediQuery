The electrode leads are connected to an implanted pulse generator located in the abdomen. After a typical post-operative period of two to five days, the recipient will be discharged home for two to six weeks of moderate activity. Following a 6 week period of laboratory exercise and training, functional use of the neuroprosthesis will begin at home and in the community with follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Laboratory assessments include walking speed and distance, physiologic cost, muscle strength, measure of spasticity, and gait analysis with and without stimulation. A number of self-reporting instruments are administered to capture individual's participation, quality of life and various aspects of perceived community ambulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Partial Paralysis","Spinal Cord Injury","Tetraplegia","Quadriplegia"],"keywords":["stroke","partial paralysis","gait correction","functional electrical stimulation","paraplegia","tetraplegia","spinal cord injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Volunteers are evaluated for appropriateness for inclusion in the study on an intent-to-treat basis.
