This study will be designed to test increasing doses of multimodal exercise in successive cohorts of six participants (cumulative 3 + 3 design)\\[22\\] (Figure 1).\n\nMaximum dose is reached when two or more participants experience DLT. DLT, dose-limiting tolerance.\n\nThe 'dose' will be defined as the ability to reach a fixed maximal level of exercise (type, duration (including session length) in the first two weeks post-stroke without experiencing dose-limiting tolerance (DLT). DLT thresholds will be based on failure to complete more than 20% of prescribed 3-day rehabilitation dose due to pain, rate of perceived exertion, fatigue, or effort required.\n\nRehabilitation and measurement sessions will be held at either at the Stroke or Geriatric Units at Campus Sint-Jan, Genk or at the rehabilitation unit at Sint-Barbara, Lanaken, with medical services on site. All participants will be monitored for fatigue and pain pre, during and at post-intervention daily. The researchers (PI of project \\[Dr Peter Hallet, ZOL\\] Postdoctoral Researcher \\[Dr Lisa Tedesco Triccas, UHasselt\\] and PhD/Masters Students \\[UHasselt) will conduct the clinical tests and will conduct the rehabilitation program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"participants with acute stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"(a) a first-ever unilateral, diagnosed stroke by a neurologist as defined by the World Health Organisation, (b) been admitted to the acute hospital for rehabilitation, (c) Upper limb hemiparesis or hemiplegia with a trace of muscle contraction:≥grade 1 at shoulder (abductors or elevators) or wrist/finger extensors measured by the MRC Scale and a score of \\<61 on the Motricity Index and severely motor affected by score of 2 or 3 on item number 5 on the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)\\[24\\], (d) the age of \\> 18 years and (e) the ability to provide informed consent.","interventionNames":["Other: upper limb rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"upper limb rehabilitation","description":"the intervention consisting of two components: a) Upper limb training protocol; b) Technology-assist training.","armGroupLabels":["participants with acute stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke","description":"a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.The scale is comprised of five domains and there are 155 items in total (motor functioning, sensory functioning, balance, joint range motion, joint pain).
