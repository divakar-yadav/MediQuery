Blood pressure will be 200 mm HG with 5 minutes of reperfusion between each inflation.\n\nSubjects will be evaluated upon arrival to the comprehensive stroke center and evaluated for side effects.\n\nThe study will be conducted at one site ( University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["remote limb ischemic conditioning","large vessel occlusion","helicopter transport"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Conditioning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Doctormate device used en route to the comprehensive stroke center","interventionNames":["Device: Ischemic conditioning device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Ischemic conditioning device","description":"RLIC will be done using a specialized blood pressure device ( Doctormate) that inflates to 200 mm HG for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes deflation.","armGroupLabels":["Ischemic Conditioning"],"otherNames":["Standard medical care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluate the feasibility of delivering RLIC by air medical crews in patients with AIS.
