The family caregivers of older adults post stroke with the first functional sequel from the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre (HCPA) will participate in the study. The randomization will be through the randomization list created by web page randomization.com.\n\nThe intervention will involve systematic monitoring of nurses through home visits (HVs) during one month. Thus, will instrumentalize the family caregiver to care of older adult with stoke according the protocol developed in a research group and the needs of care of them. The control group won't receive the HVs and could have or not the usual care guidelines provide by health services that have access.\n\nWill be collect the identification, social and demographics data of the older adults and the caregivers at the moment of hospital discharge. Therefore, will be collect the clinical data of the older adults. After discharge and at the older adult's home, will be realized the first home visit (1ª HV) to all older adults and caregivers included in the study and will be applied to the family caregiver the Caregiver Burden Scale and the instrument WHOQOL-BREF that analyse the quality of life. Also, will be applied the Measure of Functional Independence (MIF) to identify the independence level of the older adults and the needs of care. In this moment, will be randomized by an extern member of research group through telephone contact. After this first HV, the older adults and caregivers included in the intervention group will received more three HVs, until 14, 21 and 30 days after discharge, respectively, by a pair of interventional nurses.\n\nThe control group won't receive the home visits by nurses, but could have or not the usual care guidelines provide by health services that have access.\n\nAll older adults and caregivers included in the study will received a fifth HV until 60 days after discharge. In this last HV will be applied to family caregiver the Caregiver Burden Scale and the instrument WHOQOL-BREF. In addition, will be applied a questionnaire related older adult's utilization of health services and rehospitalizations during this time and the MIF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Home care services","Nursing","Clinical trial","Geriatric nursing","Family caregiver","Aged"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":82,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nursing educational intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention will consist in three home visits (14, 21, 30 days after discharge) by nurses to family caregivers.
