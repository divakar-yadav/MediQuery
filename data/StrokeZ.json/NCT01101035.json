Febuxostat compared with allopurinol was evaluated for the cardiovascular (CV) safety in people with gout and significant CV comorbidities.\n\nThe study enrolled 6198 patients. Participants with a diagnosis of gout were enrolled in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:\n\n* Febuxostat\n* Allopurinol\n\nParticipants received febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg for the study depending on their serum uric acid levels were either \\<6.0 mg/dL or ≥6.0 mg/dL during specified visits. Allopurinol 200 mg to 400 mg (for moderate renal impairment),or 300 mg to 600 mg (for normal and mild renal impairment), increased in 100 mg increments each month until serum uric acid was \\<6.0 mg/dL was received.\n\nThis multi-center trial was conducted in Canada, Mexico and United States. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 7 years (84 months).
