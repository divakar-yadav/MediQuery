Sixty subacute patients with left UN after right-hemispheric stroke were randomly assigned to three groups; rTMS combined with SC, rTMS alone, and conventional rehabilitation. rTMS at 1 Hz was applied over P5 of the contralesional hemisphere while vibration cueing was emitted using a wristwatch device on the hemiplegic arm, five days per week for two weeks. The first two groups received the same dosage of conventional rehabilitation on top of their experimental interventions. Blinded assessments were administered at baseline, 2 weeks postintervention, and four-week follow-up upon completion of training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Unilateral neglect","Right hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Low frequency rTMS at 1 Hz was applied over P5 of the contralesional hemisphere in addition to conventional rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)","Behavioral: Conventional Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"rTMS combined with sensory cueing (SC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vibration cueing was emitted using a wristwatch device on the hemiplegic arm combined with low frequency rTMS in addition to conventional rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)","Behavioral: Sensory Cueing (SC)","Behavioral: Conventional Rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Conventional rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Physical therapy and occupational therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)","armGroupLabels":["Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)","rTMS combined with sensory cueing (SC)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sensory Cueing (SC)","armGroupLabels":["rTMS combined with sensory cueing (SC)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Conventional Rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Conventional rehabilitation","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)","rTMS combined with sensory cueing (SC)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Behavior Inattention Test (BIT)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline in 4 weeks (baseline, 2-week and 2-week after training)"},{"measure":"Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline in 4 weeks (baseline, 2-week and 2-week after training)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline in 4 weeks (baseline, 2-week and 2-week after training)"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline in 4 weeks (baseline, 2-week and 2-week after training)"},{"measure":"Modified Barthel index (MBI)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline in 4 weeks (baseline, 2-week and 2-week after training)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of right-hemispheric stroke\n* Duration since onset of more than one week\n* Presenting with unilateral neglect, confirmed by the conventional subtests of the BIT with cutoff scores of 129\n* First-ever stroke, or unilateral neglect as the consequence of the last stroke\n* Being aged 18 or over\n* Mini Mental State Examination score of â‰¥17\n* Giving written consent to participate.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Duration since onset of stroke of more than six months\n* Medically unstable\n* Epileptic seizures, unconsciousness, or intracranial hypertension\n* Serious heart disease\n* Gravid\n* Severe aphasia so as to have difficulty understanding the therapists' instructions\n* Metal implants in vivo","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"21187201","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Fong KN, Lo PC, Yu YS, Cheuk CK, Tsang TH, Po AS, Chan CC.
