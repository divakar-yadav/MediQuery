There are many techniques but not any standardized technique for long term effect on reduction of spasticity and improving upper limb strength. This study aimed to explore and understand the effectiveness of neural mobilization on reduction of spasticity and improving upper limb strength in individuals with stroke. This is mixed method approach of embedded design, multicentric study recruited 7 individuals with stroke as no new themes or codes were emerging (data saturated). Median nerve mobilization was given 20 oscillations per minute for 3 times \\& repeated 3 times with a pause of 1 minute between each sets for 5times/week for 4weeks. Outcome measures were Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Brunnstrom's grading of hand recovery and Hydraulic hand dynamometer(HHD) for grip and pinch strength. Pre and post outcomes data were collected at baseline and 4weeks after intervention and in depth face to face structured interviews was conducted after 4weeks of intervention to explore the effectiveness of median nerve mobilization on reduction of spasticity and the improvement of upper limb strength.","detailedDescription":"Spasticity after stroke is common that affect upper limb strength and make activities of daily living difficult.
