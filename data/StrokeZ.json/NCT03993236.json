In particular, no clinical studies have been conducted comparing the efficacy and safety of low-dose rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe with high-dose rosuvastatin single agent for achieving target LDL-C levels.\n\nIn this trial, the investigators aim to compare the efficacy of the target LDL-C achievement between rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg (rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10 mg) and rosuvastatin 20 mg in patients with recent ischemic stroke.\n\nFor this trial, more than 292 patients (584 total) per group will be enrolled.\n\nSubjects who were satisfied with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of this trial and who agreed to participate in the clinical trial in writing were randomly assigned to a 1:1 ratio in the experimental group (the low-dose combination of rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe) and comparator group (high-dose rosuvastatin).\n\nThe duration of administration of the drug for clinical trials is 90 days (±14 days), and the efficacy and safety evaluation parameters are compared with baseline."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Stroke, Ischemic","Rosuvastatin","Ezetimibe"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":584,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe 10/10mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group is orally administered with rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg combination once daily for 90 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Experimental: Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe 10"]},{"label":"Rosuvastatin 20mg","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The comparator group is orally administered with rosuvastatin 20 mg single agent once daily for 90 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Active Comparator: Rosuvastatin 20mg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Experimental: Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe 10","description":"* Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe 10/10mg\n* orally administered once daily for 90 days","armGroupLabels":["Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe 10/10mg"],"otherNames":["Rosuzet tab 10/10 mg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Active Comparator: Rosuvastatin 20mg","description":"* Rosuvastatin 20mg\n* orally administered once daily for 90 days","armGroupLabels":["Rosuvastatin 20mg"],"otherNames":["Suvast tab 20mg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The percentage of subjects with LDL-C decreased more than 50% at 90days (±14 days) compared to Baseline","description":"The percentage of subjects with LDL-C decreased more than 50% at 90days (±14 days) compared to Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline, Visit 4(Day 90)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of subjects with LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL at 90 days(±14 days)","description":"Percentage of subjects with LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL at 90 days(±14 days)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Visit 4(Day 90)"},{"measure":"The percentage of subjects with LDL-C decreased more than or less than 70 mg/dL at 90 days(±14 days)","description":"The percentage of subjects with LDL-C decreased more than or less than 70 mg/dL at 90 days(±14 days)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Visit 4(Day 90)"},{"measure":"The decrement of LDL-C at 90 days (±14 days) compared to baseline LDL-C (absolute difference and change)","description":"The decrement of LDL-C at 90 days (±14 days) compared to baseline LDL-C (absolute difference and change)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Visit 4(Day 90)"},{"measure":"The percentage of subjects achieved multiple lipid level (Total-C < 200mg/dL, LDL-C < 70mg/dL and triglyceride < 150mg /dL)","description":"The percentage of subjects achieved multiple lipid level (Total-C \\< 200mg/dL, LDL-C \\< 70mg/dL and triglyceride \\< 150mg /dL)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Visit 4(Day 90)"},{"measure":"Cardiovascular event rates including stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), coronary artery(myocardial infarction or coronary vascular reperfusion) and death related to vascular disease.","description":"Cardiovascular event rates including stroke (ischemic of hemorrhagic), coronary artery(myocardial infarction or coronary vascular reperfusion) and death related to vascular disease.","timeFrame":"Baseline to Visit 4(up to 90 days)"},{"measure":"Number of Death of all causes.","description":"Number of Death of all causes.","timeFrame":"Baseline to Visit 4(up to 90 days)"},{"measure":"Number of subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes.","description":"Number of subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes.","timeFrame":"Visit 4(Day 90)"},{"measure":"Fatigue scale measured by Fatigue Severity Scale.","description":"Fatigue scale measured by Fatigue Severity Scale.
