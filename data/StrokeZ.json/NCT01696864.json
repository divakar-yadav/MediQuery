Home rehabilitation for stroke patients will avoid the burden of arrival to the health facilities, making it easier on them and improve their quality of life and the lives of their caregivers. To achieve this goal the investigators will examine the effectiveness and feasibility of home rehabilitation system of upper limb, consisting of ergonomic accessories (hand and arm tutors).\n\nThe quantitative indices will be based on the quantitative clinical measures that are used in regular evaluations of stroke patients and function and range of motion indices as received from the system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients - hand","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke patients with the ability to move their hand","interventionNames":["Device: Hand tutor rehabilitation device"]},{"label":"stroke patient - arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke patients with the ability to move their arms","interventionNames":["Device: Arm tutor rehabilitation device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Hand tutor rehabilitation device","description":"A rehabilitation device for the hand","armGroupLabels":["stroke patients - hand"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Arm tutor rehabilitation device","description":"A rehabilitation device for the arm","armGroupLabels":["stroke patient - arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity part (FMA)","description":"The FMA assesses the motor impairment of the upper extremity after stroke. Each movement is graded on a 3-point scale, and the total score for the upper extremity ranges from 0-60 points where a higher score represents more active movements. An additional part assesses the coordination of the affected upper extremity and the score ranges between 0-6 where a higher score represents poorer coordination ability. This test is one of the most commonly used instruments in rehabilitation and its validity and reliability have been well established","timeFrame":"10 minutes"},{"measure":"Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI)","description":"The test assesses the functional ability of the affected arm and hand of people with stroke.

In addition it is used to assess endurance of the upper extremity. The subject is asked to transfer cubes, above a partition, from one side of a box to the other for one minute with both hands. The score is the number of cubes that were transferred.
