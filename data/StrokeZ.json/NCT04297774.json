Few of studies had investigated the rehabilitation effects on balance with Pablo for patients with stroke.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality training through Pablo system in patients with chronic stroke.\n\nMETHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded assessor design was used. Patients with stroke were recruited and randomly assigned to a \"virtual reality(VR) group\" (n = 20) and \"functional balance training (FBT) group\" (n = 20). After 18 training sessions (60 minutes per session, 2 sessions per week), outcome measures which included the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up and Go Test (cognition), a gait analysis, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence scale, Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Level of pleasure, and frequency of adverse events. The data were analyzed using nonparametric tests, and significance was indicated at Î± \\< 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"virtual reality group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"18 sessions of standard treatment plus virtual reality treatment.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: virtual reality treatment","Behavioral: standard treatment"]},{"label":"standard treatment group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"18 sessions of standard treatment plus balance training.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: standard treatment","Behavioral: balance training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"virtual reality treatment","description":"18 virtual reality training through Pablo system (30 minutes a time, 2-3 times a week).

The patient is instructed to next to, but not touching, a wall and position the arm that is closer to the wall at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with a closed fist. The assessor records the starting position at the 3rd metacarpal head on the yardstick.\n\nInstruct the patient to \"Reach as far as you can forward without taking a step.\" The location of the 3rd metacarpal is recorded. Scores are determined by assessing the difference between the start and end position is the reach distance, usually measured in inches. Three trials are done and the average of the last two is noted.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up"},{"measure":"Time up and go-cognition","description":"In the TUG-cog, patients were asked to complete the test while counting backward by 3 from a randomly selected number between 20 and 100.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up"},{"measure":"Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale","description":"Activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale is a subjective measure of confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling or experiencing a sense of unsteadiness. Participants estimate on a scale of 0% to 100% how confident they are that they could perform activities such as picking a slipper up off of the floor or walking on a slippery surface without losing their balance. The item scores are then summed and divided by 16 to provide an overall mean balance confidence score.Higher scores indicate higher confidence.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale-physical domain","description":"The stroke impact scale (SIS) is a stroke-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument, which was developed by Duncan et al. (1999) at the University of Kansas Medical Center, to measure the consequences of stroke in multiple domains, including physical (strength, hand function, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL, and mobility), emotion, memory/thinking, communication, and social participation. Where the score is the domain score for a particular domain, the mean is the mean of the nonmissing item scores within that domain, with each item scored in the range of 1 to 5. Using this algorithm, each domain score has a range of 0 to 100. Higher score indicate the higher health-related quality of life.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up"},{"measure":"Modified Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale","description":"It is used to measure the enjoyment of physical activity.
