One of the reasons that it is so disabling is because of upper extremity hemiparesis (weakness in one arm), which is commonly seen after stroke.\n\nThe objective of this research is to see if a robotic system worn on the weakened arm like a brace is more useful in improving the strength and coordination of the affected arm, and those of other stroke survivors, than therapy only. Muscle weakness and lack of coordination after a stroke have great effects on how severely disabled the arm is and on quality of life after a stroke.\n\nIn this study, patients may be administered a new robotic brace as part of treatment for their affected arms. If they use this brace, your electromyography (EMG) signals will be used to control the powered arm brace. EMG signals are the small electrical signals that result from the actions of the muscles. The system will \"listen\" to patients' muscles, using small sensors that sit on top of the skin. The device will give the arm a \"power-assist\" when patients bend or straighten their elbows. The investigators want to test how easy and effective this system is to use. The investigators hypothesize that people using the robot will be more successful in their rehabilitative efforts - and that their movement will improve more - than people receiving traditional therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Myomo + RTP","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will be administered a regimen comprised of repetitive task specific practice (RTP) in conjunction with use of the robotic brace described elsewhere in this record.","interventionNames":["Device: Myomo e100 Robot and repetitive task specific training"]},{"label":"Myomo","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this group will only be administered the robotic brace described elsewhere in this record.","interventionNames":["Device: Myomo e100 neurorobotic brace"]},{"label":"RTP only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients in this group will be administered repetitive task specific practice (RTP), emphasizing use of their affected arms during performance of valued, functional tasks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Repetitive task specific training (RTP) targeting the affected arm"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Myomo e100 Robot and repetitive task specific training","description":"Subjects in this group will be administered about an hour/day of therapy targeting the affected arm.
