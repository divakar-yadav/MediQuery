Can successful occlusion of the LAA be safely achieved by cut and sew or stapler techniques?\n2. In patients with atrial fibrillation with 2 or more risk factors for stroke, will removal of the left atrial appendage (LAA) and aspirin therapy reduce the risk of systemic embolic events and major bleeding compared to warfarin?","detailedDescription":"The number one cause of disability and the 3rd leading cause of death in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is stroke. Echocardiographic studies suggest that the predominant source of stroke in AF is the left atrial appendage (LAA). At present, there are no sufficiently powered trials to answer whether removal of the LAA can reduce the risk of systemic embolic events.\n\nLAAOS pilot study will recruit 50 participants undergoing open-heart surgery in 5 Canadian academic cardiac surgery centers. The study will inform the feasibility of conducting a large RCT and will provide information of the efficacy and safety of appendage occlusion technique. From this study we envision a a large international randomized controlled trial (LAAOS II) to determine the impact of left atrial appendage occlusion on the composite outcome of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolic events in at risk patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","Stroke","left atrial appendage","Re-exploration for bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Occlusion arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Surgical intervention: Occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) using 'cut-and-sew' technique appendage occlusion.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage"]},{"label":"Medical arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Medical arm: The comparator is best medical practice for atrial fibrillation related stroke prevention as per guidelines.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Best medical practice"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage","description":"Study intervention: Within the trial, occlusion must be performed using either amputation and closure (cut and sew) or stapler device.","armGroupLabels":["Occlusion arm"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Best medical practice","description":"Best medical practice for atrial fibrillation related stroke prevention as per guidelines.","armGroupLabels":["Medical arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Demonstration of efficacy of cut-and-sew and stapler technique of appendage occlusion by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, central adjudication.","timeFrame":"Outcomes will be measured at discharge, 4-8 weeks post-op and long term (1 to 4 years)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Demonstration of study feasibility, procedure safety, including rate of post-operative re-exploration for bleeding.","timeFrame":"Outcomes will be measured at discharge, 4-8 weeks post-op and long term (1 to 4 years)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients undergoing any cardiac surgical procedure with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass\n* A history of ECG-documented atrial fibrillation with prior stroke or TIA, or at least two of the following risk factors:\n\n  * age =\\> 65 years\n  * hypertension\n  * diabetes mellitus, or\n  * heart failure/left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 50%\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients in whom surgical AF ablation (MAZE or otherwise) is planned\n* Planned \"off-pump\" surgery\n* Planned implantation of a mechanical valve\n* Heart transplant, complex congenital heart surgery, and ventricular assist device insertion, reoperation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Richard Whitlock, MD, FRCSC","affiliation":"McMaster University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hamilton General Hospital","city":"Hamilton","state":"Ontario","zip":"L8L 2X2","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.25011,"lon":-79.84963}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9246","name":"Hemorrhage","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
