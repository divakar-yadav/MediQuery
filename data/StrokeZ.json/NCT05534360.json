It is administered at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) with an intravenous bolus (10% of the dose) followed by a one-hour infusion. Tenecteplase is a genetically modified form of alteplase with greater fibrin specificity and a longer half-life, which allows a simpler one bolus administration at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg).\n\nIn the Tenecteplase versus Alteplase before Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) randomized clinical trial, which compared tenecteplase and alteplase in bridging therapy for AIS with LVO, tenecteplase achieved a better recanalization rate on arteriography before MT and a better functional outcome at 3 months. Following this trial, tenecteplase was added in stroke guidelines as an alternative to alteplase for IVT in bridging therapy. More recently, the Alteplase compared to Tenecteplase (ACT) trial has shown, in patients with LVO and non-LVO AIS, that tenecteplase is non-inferior to alteplase in terms of functional outcome. It is likely that in the near future tenecteplase will be added as an alternative to alteplase for AIS without LVO. However, while some \"real-life\" studies have been published on tenecteplase use for AIS with LVO, data on the general use of tenecteplase are still scarce.\n\nThe Tenecteplase Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke (TETRIS) Registry is multicenter ambispective observational study of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis with Tenecteplase. The main aim of this registry is to provide routine clinical care data on the use of tenecteplase for IVT for both AIS with and without LVO, in order to further characterize the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase for AIS. Additionally, we aim to use this registry which combines clinical and radiological data to explore other aspects related to AIS management in this cohort."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemic stroke","Thrombolytic therapy","Tenecteplase","Thrombectomy","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain diseases","Central Nervous Diseases","Nervous system Diseases","Vascular Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tenecteplase","description":"All consecutive patients with an arterial acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Modified Rankin score (mRS), score ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (death).","timeFrame":"Day 90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacy on functional independence (mRS ≤ 2)","description":"Rate of functional independence defined as a modified Rankin score 0-2","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Mortality rate","description":"Rate of all-cause mortality","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Early neurological outcome","description":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score after 24 hours, ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 42 (death)","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Incidence of haemorrhagic transformation","description":"Incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage on MRI or CT after 24 hours (±12 hours) according to the ECASS II classification.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Incidence of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH)","description":"Incidence of sICH according to the SITS-MOST definition.","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Pre-thrombectomy recanalization rate","description":"Rate of complete or near complete recanalization, defined as an extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b50/2b66/2c/3 before thrombectomy","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Final recanalization rate","description":"Rate of complete or near complete recanalization after","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Thrombolysis complication rate","description":"Rate of complications linked to intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Thrombectomy complication rate","description":"Rate of patients with secondary decompressive craniectomy","timeFrame":"Day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 and older\n* Confirmed acute arterial ischemic stroke on brain imaging (CT or MRI) within 270 minutes of symptoms onset or with perfusion CT or MRI criteria for an extended treatment window or wake-up strokes.\n* Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contra-indication to intravenous thrombolysis\n* Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase\n* Venous ischemic stroke","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"All consecutive adult patients with an acute arterial ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase in the participating centers.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sonia Alamowitch, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"1 71 97 06 51","phoneExt":"+33","email":"sonia.alamowitch@aphp.fr"},{"name":"Gaspard Gerschenfeld, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"1 42 16 24 75","phoneExt":"+33","email":"gaspard.gerschenfeld@aphp.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sonia Alamowitch, MD","affiliation":"Assistance Publique -
