The investigators have previously established the effectiveness of a backward walking training program to improve gait and balance in post-stroke Veterans. To best serve Veterans in this era of personalized medicine, there is a current need to determine the appropriate training dose as well as which post-stroke Veterans would most benefit. This study addresses both needs as it will 1) test responses to two different doses (18 vs. 27 sessions) of backward walking training and 2) assess brain activity, measured by magnetic resonance imaging, before and after training intervention to determine its ability to predict rehabilitation response as well as brain mechanisms of behavioral change.","detailedDescription":"This prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will enroll individuals between 2- and 4-months post-stroke and is designed to address the study's three Specific Aims (See Figure below). The study will be approved by an ethics review board and all participants will provide written informed consent. Baseline pre-intervention assessment (Assessment A) will consist of clinical gait and balance assessments and resting state Functional Connectivity MRI and functional MRI. Brain imaging at Assessment A will test the hypotheses that rs-FC and fMRI can predict BWTraining intervention response (Specific Aim 2). Following Assessment A, participants will be randomized to receive 1) 18 sessions or 2) 27-sessions of BWTraining 3x/week for six or nine weeks respectively. Participants in the 18-session group will wait 3 weeks following randomization to begin training such that Assessment B will take place at approximately the same time post-stroke for all participants. This will assure that all participants have had the same duration of time post-stroke after study enrollment to experience spontaneous recovery. Gait and balance measures at Assessment B will be compared to Assessment A to test Specific Aim #1. MRI brain measurements at Assessment B will be compared to those at Assessment A to test the hypotheses of exploratory Aim #3. Assessment C, at six weeks post-intervention will evaluate short-term and Assessment D, at 6-months post-intervention will evaluate long-term retention gains in gait and balance. The investigators will recruit 54 individuals post-stroke to allow up to a 10% attrition rate and still provide a sufficient participant pool (n=48) to address the Specific Aims."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Gait","Physical Therapy Modalities","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Postural Balance","Accidental Falls"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) 27 sessions of backward walking training or 2) 18 sessions of backward walking training","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome Assessors will be masked to group assignment.
