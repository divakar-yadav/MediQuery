However, evidence on the effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours in the real-world is insufficient.\n\nThis is a multi-center, prospective, registry cohort study that acute ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy due to large vessel occlusion of anterior circulation within 24 hours from stroke onset in China.
