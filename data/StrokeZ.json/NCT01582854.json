Subjects received IV infusions whilst in hospital, and tablets once discharged. Subjects were followed up for a further six months after their treatment had been stopped to explore if the cognitive symptoms of the subjects treated with Actovegin showed sustained improvement. The trial also explored the possible prevention of dementia with Actovegin in patients who had suffered a recent ischaemic stroke, as well as the effect of Actovegin on other stroke outcomes. Safety information on Actovegin was collected.","detailedDescription":"The drug tested in this study is called actovegin. Actovegin was tested to treat people who have post stroke cognitive impairment. This study looked at the improvement of cognitive symptoms in people who take actovegin compared to placebo.\n\nThe study enrolled 503 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study:\n\n* Actovegin-2000 mg intravenous solution; 2- 200 mg tablets 3 times a day\n* Placebo intravenous solution; tablets (dummy inactive) - this is a solution or tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient\n\nAll participants received daily intravenous infusions in the hospital (up to a maximum of 20 infusions) followed by 2-200 mg tablets three times a day for the remainder of the 6-month treatment period.\n\nThis multi-centre trial was conducted in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. The overall time to participate in this study was 12 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic plus a final visit after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment (PSCI)"],"keywords":["Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment (PSCI)","Stroke","Actovegin","Cognition disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":503,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Actovegin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Actovegin 2000 mg solution, intravenous (IV) infusion for up to 20 days followed by 2 actovegin 200 mg, tablets, orally, 3 times a day for up to 6 months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Actovegin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Actovegin placebo-matching solution, intravenous (IV) infusion for up to 20 days followed by 2 actovegin placebo-matching, tablets, orally, 3 times a day for up to 6 months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Actovegin","description":"Actovegin solution for infusion and Actovegin tablets","armGroupLabels":["Actovegin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Actovegin placebo-matching solution for infusion and Actovegin placebo-matching tablets","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale + Cognitive Subscale Extended Version (ADAS-cog+) at Month 6","description":"The ADAS-cog measures cognitive performance by combining the ratings of 11 items.
