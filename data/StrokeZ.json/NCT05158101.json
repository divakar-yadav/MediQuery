Patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs. The total dose will be 100 million cells. Patients will be evaluated within one month pre treatment and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months post treatment for safety and efficacy.\n\nFor patients with more severe disease an autologous Effector cells (activated lymphocytes) treatment will be utilized created from the patient's own cells obtained by apheresis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","stem cell treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Group (AlloRx)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single intravenous infusion of 100 million cells","interventionNames":["Biological: AlloRx"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"AlloRx","description":"cultured allogeneic adult umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Group (AlloRx)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety (adverse events)","description":"Clinical monitoring of possible adverse events or complications","timeFrame":"Four year follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of Stroke\n* Understanding and willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active infection\n* Active cancer\n* Chronic multisystem organ failure\n* Pregnancy\n* Clinically significant Abnormalities on pre-treatment laboratory evaluation\n* Medical condition that would (based on the opinion of the investigator) compromise patient's safety.\n* Continued drug abuse\n* Pre-menopausal women not using contraception\n* Previous organ transplant\n* Hypersensitivity to sulfur","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Chadwick Prodromos, MD","affiliation":"The Foundation for Orthopaedics and Regenerative Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Medical Surgical Associates Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"St. John's","country":"Antigua and Barbuda","contacts":[{"name":"Chadwick Prodromos, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8476996810","email":"care@thepsci.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":17.12094,"lon":-61.8433}},{"facility":"Center for Investigation in Tissue Engineering and Cellular Therapy","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Buenos Aires","country":"Argentina","contacts":[{"name":"Chadwick Prodromos, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8476996810","phoneExt":"202","email":"Care@thepsci.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-34.61315,"lon":-58.37723}},{"facility":"Medyca Bosques","status":"RECRUITING","city":"San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a","state":"N.L","country":"Mexico","contacts":[{"name":"Chadwick Prodromos, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"8476996810","phoneExt":"202","email":"Care@thepsci.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.65716,"lon":-100.40268}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
