Transcranial direct current stimulation stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive tool that can be used to modulate cortical excitability of the leg motor area, and the spinal motor circuits as well.\n\nObjective:The objectives of this study is to examine the efficacy of anodal tDCS combined with Biodex balance training on lower limbs spasticity in chronic stroke patients using laboratory and clinical assessments.","detailedDescription":"In a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded clinical study, hemiplegic chronic stroke patients are randomized to receive active tDCS delivered to lesioned leg motor cortex (CZ) or sham combined with balance training with Biodex balance system.\n\nExperimental group receive tDCS stimulation (2mA) for 20 min, 5 sessions in five days paired with 20 min balance training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["tDCS","stroke","Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1:tDCS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) Participants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]},{"label":"Arm 2: Sham tDCS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham tDCS and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days","interventionNames":["Device: Sham tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","description":"Participants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation for 20 minutes plus balance training for 20 minutes for 5 consecutive days.","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1:tDCS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham tDCS","description":"During sham stimulation, the current ramped up for 30 seconds, ramped back down for 30 seconds, and then remained off for the duration of the stimulation plus balance training for 20 minutes for 5 consecutive days.","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2: Sham tDCS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Spasticity (Modified Ashworth scale)","description":"Modified Ashworth scale(MAS)","timeFrame":"After 5 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motoneuron excitability (H-reflex latency)","description":"H-reflex latency","timeFrame":"After 5 days"},{"measure":"Motoneuron excitability","description":"H Max/M MaxRatio","timeFrame":"After 5 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age â‰¥18 years;\n* first-ever ischemic stroke;\n* chronic phase of recovery (\\>6 months);\n* ability to walk 6- meter supported or unsupported;\n* ability to stand at least unsupported for 40-seconds with eyes closed;\n* only ischemic stroke involving middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory confirmed by CT or MRI.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any neuro- or psycho-active medications that alters balance;\n* any other neurological conditions or sensory disorders affecting postural control;
