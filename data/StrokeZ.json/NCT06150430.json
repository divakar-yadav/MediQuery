The robotic device is the Active Pelvic Orthosis RT v3.1 (IUVO APO) developed bu IUVO S.r.l.","detailedDescription":"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, reliability and short-term effectiveness of APO-based training to increase the self-selected walking velocity (SSV) of stroke patients. The endpoint to evaluate the APO-based training effectiveness will be the difference in self-selected walking velocity (m/s) comparing post-training session (T4) to baseline sessions (T1\\&T2).\n\nOther objective of the study, both secondary and exploratory, have been defined to further investigate the effects of the IUVO APO on post-stroke subjects.\n\nThe Investigational Device, Active Pelvis Orthosis RT v3.1 (APO), is a bilateral powered robotic hip orthosis (or exoskeleton) designed to gently assist hip flexion-extension movements by providing smooth assistive torque at the hip level, automatically adapting to natural gait variations.\n\nThe study will be an interventional single-arm clinical trial with no control group and will involve up to 20 subjects, that fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This should be sufficient to provide the input needed to reach the primary and secondary objectives of the trial.\n\nIn the protocol, after the screening visit, subjects will take part in 14 experimental sessions: two baseline sessions (T1-T2), three familiarization sessions (F1-F3), six training sessions (E1-E6), two assessment sessions (one pre-training T3 and one post training T4) and one 2-month follow-up session (T5). Depending on the session, the subject will be asked to walk with or without the APO, or both. During the assessment sessions, the subject will be evaluated through different standard tests (such as 10MWTs and 2mWTs) and instrumented gait analysis, with and without APO. In the training sessions, the subject will perform some overground walking practice with APO."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hip exoskeleton","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Nervous System Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Training with APO","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants are assigned to the training group with the APO","interventionNames":["Device: APO"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"APO","description":"Subjects will take part in 14 experimental sessions: two baseline sessions (T1-T2), three familiarization sessions (F1-F3), six training sessions (E1-E6), two assessment sessions (one pre-training T3 and one post training T4) and one 2-month follow-up session (T5).
