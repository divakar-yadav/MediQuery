Both groups received the same ITR procedure (6x5x60 weeks/days/minutes). Following ITR, a robot-assisted rehabilitation program of 60 minutes, five days a week, for six weeks, was applied to the RR group, and an individualized upper extremity rehabilitation program to the CR group. Evaluations were made at baseline and after six weeks using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Evaluation Scale (FMA-UE), and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT).","detailedDescription":"Assessments:\n\n- Demographic Data Form: The researchers created a form to include the information on age, gender, stroke onset date, lesion type, affected side, and dominant extremity.\n\n- Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment: This disease-specific scale was created as an objective motor impairment scale to assess recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients (18). It includes subsections that assess joint movements, coordination, and reflex activities related to the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The maximum score that can be obtained is 66, with a high score indicating good motor condition. The affected upper extremities are assessed with the subject in a seated position.\n\n- Wolf Motor Function Test: This test was created to evaluate the motor ability of the upper extremity (19). The test consists of 17 items, 15 of which are related to the fields of functional skill and performance time, and 2 to muscle strength (20). The total score is used for the functional ability of the patients. The two items of muscle strength evaluation were not used in this study.\n\n- Trunk Impairment Scale: This scale evaluates static and dynamic sitting balance and trunk coordination with seventeen items. The total score ranges from 0 - 23 points, with a higher score indicating better performance. The test-retest and inter-rater reliability coefficients of the scale have been shown to be 0.85-0.99 (21)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Robotic Rehabilitation","Conventional Rehabilitation","IntensÄ±ve Trunk Rehabilitation","Motor Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A Randomized Controlled (One group received Robotic Rehabilitation, other group received conventional rehabilitation)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic Rehabilitation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The standardized ITR program was applied to both groups for 60 minutes a day, five days a week, for six weeks.

This group received a robotic rehabilitation program for the upper extremity with a Houston Bionics ExoRehab X brand/model device. This device has no motor force of repulsion or attraction. Patients initiate and maintain their movements during the exercise. The device supports the patient's active movement and allows extensive movement repetition.\n\nBefore starting robotic rehabilitation, the patient was seated upright on the platform. The games were projected onto a 43-inch television screen. The exercise program was planned to include upper extremity movements in all directions.","interventionNames":["Device: Robot-Assissted Therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The standardized ITR program was applied to both groups for 60 minutes a day, five days a week, for six weeks.

The ITR program included exercises of abdominal strengthening, controlled pelvic movements, bridging, trunk lateral flexion and rotation, reaching forward and sideways, and push-ups with a Swiss Ball.\n\nCR applied after the ITR program consisted of an individualized rehabilitation program for the upper extremities.
