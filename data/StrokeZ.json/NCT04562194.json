Age ≥18\n2. NIHSS score ≥ 6\n3. Pre-stroke mRS score ≤ 1\n4. Intracranial arterial occlusion of the distal intracranial carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1/M2), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), basilar artery, or vertebral artery demonstrated with DSA.\n5. Thrombectomy procedure can be initiated within 24 hours from symptom onset (defined as time last known well \\[TLKW\\])\n6. Imaging Inclusion Criteria:\n\n   The patient should have confirmed LVO and salvageable penumbra. Any automated software for determine the volume of viable tissue is acceptable. patient selection should follow the following guidelines:\n   * ASPECTS 6-10 if treatment started 0-6 hours from TLKW\n   * ASPECTS 8-10 if treatment started 6-24 hours from TLKW\n   * Ischemic core ≤ 50 cc\n7. Subject or legal representative is able and willing to give informed consent within 72 hours after the intervention (may use independent physician consent in this timeframe and gain subject or legal representative consent later than 72 hours).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pre-existing medical neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological or functional evaluations, e.g. dementia with prescribed anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g. Aricept).\n2. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, significant cardiac arrhythmia, evidence of ongoing myocardial infarction, concern for pre- treatment pulmonary aspiration.\n3. Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or stroke in multiple territories\n4. Cerebral vasculitis\n5. History of severe allergy to contrast medium.\n6. Known allergy to NeVa materials (nitinol, stainless steel)\n7. Suspicion of aortic dissection, septic embolus, or bacterial endocarditis\n8. Systemic infection\n9. Significant mass effect with midline shift\n10. Evidence of intracranial tumor (except small meningioma)\n11. Inability to deploy NeVA device for at least one pass for any other reason\n12. Life expectancy less than 6 months\n13. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes an endovascular procedure or poses a significant hazard to the subject if an endovascular procedure was performed.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Antoine Cuijpers","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+31 6 51 55 99 37","email":"acuijpers@vesalio.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hospital Espanol de Mendoza","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Mendoza","country":"Argentina","contacts":[{"name":"Fernando Petra, MD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-32.89084,"lon":-68.82717}},{"facility":"Niguarda Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Milan","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Edoardo Boccardi","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39 3516775140"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.46427,"lon":9.18951}},{"facility":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Abu Dhabi","country":"United Arab Emirates","contacts":[{"name":"John Shelby, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+971 2 659 0200"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":24.46667,"lon":54.36667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16376","name":"Thrombosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Acute Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
