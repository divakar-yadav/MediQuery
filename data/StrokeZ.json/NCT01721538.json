It is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled multicentre trial with two arms. The therapy arm is participating in a comprehensive weight reducing program, whereas the control group takes part in a lecture on healthy nutrition. The primary study objective is to assess the efficacy of non-drug therapeutic weight reduction in the secondary prevention of stroke. Secondary objectives are functional outcome, cognitive status, post stroke depression, and health-related quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Obesity"],"keywords":["stroke","prevention","obesity","weight reduction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Therapy arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-drug therapeutic weight reduction program (15 weeks)","interventionNames":["Other: Weight reduction program"]},{"label":"Control arm","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Lecture on healthy nutrition (1 hour)","interventionNames":["Other: Lecture on healthy nutrition"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Weight reduction program","armGroupLabels":["Therapy arm"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Lecture on healthy nutrition","armGroupLabels":["Control arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary endpoint is the number of deaths or major vascular events defined as stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction or hospitalization due to angina pectoris, which occur between the randomization and last follow-up.","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Functional outcome as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index (BI)","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Cognitive deficits","description":"Cognitive deficits in terms of vascular dementia as measured by the Structural Interview for diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia and multi-infarct dementia (SIDAM), the Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (VADAS-Cog), Stroop test and the Trail Makin Test","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Post stroke depression","description":"Post stroke depression as measured by Beck Depression Inventar (BDI II) and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) as measured by the EuroQol (EQ5D, visual analogue scale), Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, Stroke Impact Scale.","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Severity of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia","timeFrame":"18 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of ischemic stroke\n* Age: 20 - 85 years\n* BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m² or waist circumference in men ≥ 94cm and in women ≥ 80cm\n* Functional impairment, which would allow to participate in weight reduction program (mRS 0-4, NIHSS 0-12)\n* Patient must be capable of understanding informed consent\n* Written informed consent for participation in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Intracerebral hemorrhage as primary cause of stroke (secondary hemorrhage is not an exclusion criterion)\n* Speech disturbance (aphasia or sever dysarthria)\n* Dimming of consciousness\n* Stroke due to arterial dissection or coagulation disorder\n* Drug-related weight changes during previous 3 months\n* Changes in appetite influencing medication listed in appendix during previous 3 months\n* Bariatric surgery in the past\n* Diabetes mellitus with a history of severe ketoacidosis\n* Pregnancy or nursing\n* Severe co-morbid disorders, e.g.:\n\n  * AV-Block ≥ 2nd degree\n  * Heart insufficiency (NYHA \\> 2)\n  * Pericarditis, pericardial effusion\n  * Severe kidney insufficiency (Creatinine \\> 3 mg/dl;
