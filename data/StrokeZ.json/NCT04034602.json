The patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who are excluded from the exclusion criteria will be randomized according to the order of arrival and will be divided into two groups as the vibration group and the placebo group.Patients will be taken to the placebo and vibration group respectively in order of arrival. If the next patient falls outside the inclusion criteria of the study, randomization will be applied to the next patient. The vibration group, one session in supine position will be applied to both sides of the soles of the feet under the soles of the feet for 5 minutes with a 15-100 Hz frequency CE certified vibration device. In the placebo group, both sides will be held in the supine position under the soles of the foot for 5 minutes each so that the device is in contact with the foot without vibration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["stroke vibration fall risk postural stability","immediate effect","fall risk","postural stability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"30 stroke patients will be included in this study.

The higher the score, the higher the risk of falling. The device compares the test results with normal age-related data to calculate the risk of falling, the platform was set to move from 12 to 8, with the platform moving. The test is carry out with 3 repetitions, each with a resting time of 10 seconds each, lasting 20 's each while the platform is static. On the support surface formed by placing the two legs in a comfortable position on the platform, it is requested to keep the black dot on the screen of the device in the middle of the visual on the screen for 20 seconds. The average of these 3 repetitions is automatically calculated by the device for the risk of falling.","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"biodex balance system postural stability test","description":"The Postural Stability Test assessment the participant's ability to control the center of gravity. The extent to which the participant's position deviates from the center is measured and reports the mean deviation as the stability index. A low score indicates that the amount of deviation is small and postural stability is good. If the standard deviation is high, the participant's postural oscillation is also high when the test platform is in a static state, each is 20 seconds lasting, between 10 seconds rest period was done as 3 repetitions. On the support surface formed by placing the two legs in a comfortable position on the platform, it was requested to keep the black dot on the screen of the device in the middle of the visual on the screen for 20 seconds. For the Mediolateral Stability Index, Anterioposterior Stability Index and General Stability Index showing the postural stability, the mean of 3 replicates of this test was automatically calculated by the device.","timeFrame":"5 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cognitive and non-communication problems\n* Volunteer to join the work\n* Those with less than 150 kilos\n* Spasticity according to a Modified Scale Ashworth 2 and 3 patients treated with Botox\n* Patients at least 8 weeks after stroke diagnosis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* People who are not stable due to vital signs\n* Open wounds under the soles of the feet\n* Being spastic at the level that will block the base touch\n* Pathological conditions affecting lower limb sense (diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post- fracture surgery)\n* 20 seconds independent standing\n* Mini Mental Test score below 24\n* Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, etc.\n* Those with vision problems\n* Patients with thoracolumbar surgery\n* Patients with spinal canal stenosis","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Birol Önal","affiliation":"Kirikkale Univercity","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Kırıkkale University","city":"Kırıkkale","zip":"71000","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":39.84528,"lon":33.50639}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
