However, treatment of acute stroke is limited except thrombolytic therapy in hyperacute stroke within several hours. Currently, aspirin is widely used in spite of its small benefit compared to bleeding complications.\n\nCilostazol will be compared to aspirin in acute stroke patients in terms of functional outcome at 3 months, efficacy to prevent stroke recurrence, and safety for bleeding complications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction"],"keywords":["cilostazol","aspirin","cerebral infarction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":468,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cilostazol"},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of the frequency of mRS 0, 1, 2 at 90 days","timeFrame":"at 90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency of mRS 0,1 at 90 days","timeFrame":"at 90 days"},{"measure":"Frequency of Barthel index 95-100 at 90 days"},{"measure":"Frequency of mRS 0,1 & Barthel index 95-100 at 90 days"},{"measure":"Frequency of NIHSS 0-1 at 90 days"},{"measure":"Frequency of progression of neurological deficit at 7 days (increment of NIHSS 2 points or a point on the item of upper or lower extremity weakness)"},{"measure":"Bleeding disorders (life-threatening bleeding; major bleeding; minor Bleeding)"},{"measure":"Overall cardiovascular events (Ischemic heart disease requiring rehospitalization)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who receive explanation on this study and give informed consent\n* Patients aged 30 to 85 years\n* Baseline NIHSS less than 15\n* Onset of symptoms within 48 hours of the start of investigational product\n* Full functional independence prior to the present stroke indicated by an mRS score of 0, 1, 2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Evidence from CT or MRI scan of an acute intracranial hemorrhage, a tumor, encephalitis or any diagnosis other than acute ischemic stroke likely to cause the present symptoms.\n* Previous regular use of an antiplatelet agent or warfarin\n* Patients with known cardiac disease likely to cause cardiogenic embolism or congestive heart failure\n* Evidence from CT or MRI scan of midline shift when visiting hospital\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP\\>220 mmHg or DBP\\>120 mmHg)\n* Hypotension (\\<90/60 mmHg)\n* Patients with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder\n* Patients with liver disease (ALT\\>100 or AST\\>100), or renal disease (creatinine\\>2.0 mg/dl)\n* Known severe anaemia (hemoglobin\\<8.0 mg/dl), or thrombocytopenia (platelet\\<100,000/mm3)\n* Scheduled for endarterectomy within 3 months\n* Severe co-morbidity likely to limit patient's life expectancy to less than 6 months\n* Patients with alcohol or illegal drug abuse or dependency\n* Pregnant or lactating patients.
