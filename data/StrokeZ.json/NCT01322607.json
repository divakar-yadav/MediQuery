Therefore, interventions targeting movement economy should be developed for those in the chronic phase of stroke recovery. This study is designed to compare the effect of two distinctly different exercise paradigms (a higher-intensity treadmill training program and a lower-intensity group exercise program) on economy of movement during over-ground walking and activities of daily living, as well as the extent to which gains in muscular strength, muscular endurance, and balance predict changes in movement economy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke"],"keywords":["Exercise","Rehabilitation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1: High-Intensity Program","type":"OTHER","description":"High-intensity treadmill-based exercise","interventionNames":["Behavioral: High-intensity Treadmill Exercise"]},{"label":"Arm 2: Low-Intensity Program","type":"OTHER","description":"Low-intensity lifestyle intervention (group exercise)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Low-intensity Lifestyle Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"High-intensity Treadmill Exercise","description":"High-intensity treadmill walking program","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1: High-Intensity Program"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Low-intensity Lifestyle Intervention","description":"A low-intensity lifestyle intervention targeted towards group exercises incorporating balance, coordination, and strength.","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2: Low-Intensity Program"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Economy of Gait","description":"Over-ground gait economy measured using a portable metabolic monitoring system, K4b2 during a 6 minute walk, with subjects walking at their comfortable self-selected walking speed while open circuit spirometry collects break-by-break data.
