This applies particularly to glioblastoma (GBM) since the positive diagnosis is evoked on MRI imaging and the diagnosis of certainty provided by anatomopathology. There are no perfect techniques and there are problems of differential diagnosis in imaging. Sometimes the context does not allow biopsy or excision.\n\nThis study is a prospective multi-center observational study designed to be conducted in patients with malignant CNS tumours: primary glioblastoma (60 GBM), primary CNS lymphomas (20 PCNSL), brain metastases (40 BM), in an attempt to establish plasma microRNA signatures characteristic of a tumour process. Patients with cerebral stroke (20 CS) and healthy volunteers (20 HV) will also participate in the study. For each patient, a panel of 762 microRNAs will be screened in plasma.\n\nFirst, the investigators will focus on the potentially diagnostic nature of the signature, which may prove useful when there are problems of differential diagnosis in imaging or when the context does not permit biopsy or excision. The main objective of the study is to establish a plasma microRNA signature specific to GBM, capable of distinguishing them from malignant non-glial brain tumours (PCNSL and BM). Within the main objective, discrimination will be established between GBM and malignant non-glial brain tumours.\n\nSecondly, the quantitative approach of plasma miRNoma with 752 microRNAs studied in the different patient groups will allow for other objectives:1/ Establish plasma microRNA signatures characteristic of other types of brain tumours; 2/ Identify a plasma microRNA signature characteristic of the cerebral injury component independently of the tumor component with the CS and HV groups; 3/ Identify plasma microRNA signatures characteristic of GBM subtypes in relation to their genomic alterations; 4/ Establish correlations between plasma microRNA expression levels and data collected through multi-modality MRI imaging and anatomopathology."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Tumors"],"keywords":["MicroRNAs","Glioblastoma","nonglial tumors","stroke","diagnosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Plasma and serum samples aliquoted and stored may be used either for re-analysis if necessary for the current study or as part"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GBM","description":"Primary glioblastoma (GBM)"},{"label":"PCNSL","description":"Primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL)"},{"label":"Brain metastases","description":"Brain metastases (BM)"},{"label":"Cerebral Stroke","description":"Cerebral Stroke (CS)"},{"label":"Healthy Volunteers","description":"Healthy Volunteers (HV)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"QR (relative amount)","description":"QR (relative amount) of each plasma microRNA for GBM and non-glial tumors (PCNSL, BM).","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months after the end of all samplings."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"QR value of each microRNA for all groups","description":"QR value of each microRNA for all groups","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months after the end of all samplings"},{"measure":"Genetic abnormalities","description":"Genetic abnormalities of GBM subtypes","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months after the end of the study"},{"measure":"Main imaging and anatomopathology characteristics","description":"Description of main imaging and anatomopathological characteristics","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months after the end of the study"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
