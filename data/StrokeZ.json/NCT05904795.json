The randomized central trial will recruit patients according to consecutive sampling into two intervention groups. One group will receive proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation strengthening exercises and other group will receive de-Lorme and Watkins exercises program.","detailedDescription":"A study in which the participants (n=26) were recruited in the study suffering from stroke and meeting the inclusion criteria. Two groups formed such that patients in group A will be treated with conventional therapy and PNF and group B will be treated with PNF and NMES in along with conventional therapy. The protocol will cover 6 weeks of treatment. Regular assessment at 0,3rd and 6th week will be carried out. In the rehabilitation period, we will evaluate upper extremity function, activities of daily living(ADLs), mental status examination at regular interval during the rehabilitation.In previous studies there is less literature regarding the combine effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques and de-Lorme and Watkins exercise program on upper limb function and strength in chronic stroke patients with upper limb weakness. Therefore there is dire need to explore which training technique is most effective in improving upper limb function and strength in chronic stroke patients therefore this study aims in comparative effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation strengthening exercises and de-Lorme and Watkins exercise program on upper limb function and strength in chronic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Paresis"],"keywords":["Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PNF strengthening exercises","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pnf strengthening exercises along with isometrics and range of motion exercises","interventionNames":["Other: PNF strengthening exercises"]},{"label":"de-lorme and watkins progressive resistance exercises","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"progressive resistance exercises along with isometrics and range of motion exercises","interventionNames":["Other: de-lorme and watkins exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"PNF strengthening exercises","description":"PNF strengthening exercises 10 repetitions, 1set , 4 days/week along with range of motion exercises total of 4 sessions were given consisting 40 minutes","armGroupLabels":["PNF strengthening exercises"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"de-lorme and watkins exercises","description":"The group was given de-lorme and watkins progressive resistance exercises along with range of motion exercises .10 repetitions, 1set, 4 days /week along with range of motion exercises.\n\ntotal of 4 sessions per week each consisting of 40 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["de-lorme and watkins progressive resistance exercises"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The barthel index scale","description":"The Barthel Index (BI) is a measure of independence in activities of daily living (ADL).It contains 10 components which has different scores.The total score is calculated by dividing 100.","timeFrame":"4th day"},{"measure":"Hand held dynamometer","description":"The hand held dynamometry is an objective method in detecting minimum muscle strength change, which has an impact on the physical function of ICU survivors.
