The using in stroke group is countless. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted in the medical community to assess efficacy, and the results mostly suggest that acupuncture may be an effective, low side effects adjuvant therapy. Ischemic stroke is also associated with chronic inflammation-related diseases. In recent years, the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture was gradually found. So, whether in the basic or in clinical, the investigators can deduce that acupuncture may be helpful for stroke as an adjuvant therapy.\n\nThis study evaluates the neurological function of patients with acute stroke by using the widely used National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index. Also, the investigators assess the degree of inflammation by biomarkers. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of acupuncture intervention on acute ischemic patients and its relationship in anti-inflammatory actions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Acupuncture"],"keywords":["Stroke","Acupuncture","antiinflammatory","NIHSS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Traditional Acupuncture","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Traditional acupoints and traditional \"deqi\" manipulation","interventionNames":["Procedure: Traditional Acupuncture"]},{"label":"Minimal Acupuncture","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"To avoid traditional acupoints and minimal manipulation","interventionNames":["Procedure: Minimal Acupuncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Traditional Acupuncture","description":"widely ongoing traditional acupoints in scalp and limbs with traditional \"deqi\" manipulation, for stroke patient","armGroupLabels":["Traditional Acupuncture"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Minimal Acupuncture","description":"non-traditional acupoints in scalp and limbs, with minimal manipulation","armGroupLabels":["Minimal Acupuncture"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","description":"The NIHSS improving in about a 2-months-period follow up.","timeFrame":"1.beginning of stroke (within 3 days after onset);
