There is evidence that intensive aphasia therapy is effective for language recovery, even in the chronic phase post-stroke. However, as many patients are left with residual language disorders and intensive aphasia rehabilitation is difficult to achieve, the investigators are exploring tablet-based therapies to further facilitate language recovery in a cost-effective manner.","detailedDescription":"This study will investigate the clinical effects of intensive tablet-based aphasia therapy as an add-on to conventional aphasia therapy (= high intensive) compared to conventional aphasia therapy (either alone, or in combination with recreational tablet use (= low intensive) in patients with aphasia following stroke, as measured by specific linguistic tests, within task improvements, functional communication and quality of life.\n\nFurthermore, the investigators want to learn more about the recovery of specific underlying language processes via event-related potentials (ERPs). At last, the investigators aim to explore whether patients with aphasia are satisfied with a tablet-based aphasia therapy, whether the app is user-friendly and which barriers the participants might have encountered."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"aphasia therapy + speech app","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"3 hours per week of conventional aphasia therapy during 3 weeks + 5 hours per week during 3 weeks independent practice via the speech app","interventionNames":["Device: speech app","Behavioral: aphasia therapy"]},{"label":"aphasia therapy + brain games","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3 hours per week of conventional aphasia therapy during 3 weeks + 5 hours per week during 3 weeks of recreational tables use (brain games)","interventionNames":["Device: brain games","Behavioral: aphasia therapy"]},{"label":"aphasia therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"3 hours per week of conventional aphasia therapy during 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: aphasia therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"speech app","description":"language exercises provided by the speech therapist in hospital + independent practice of language exercises via a tablet and speech app","armGroupLabels":["aphasia therapy + speech app"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"brain games","description":"language exercises provided by the speech therapist in hospital + independent recreational tablet use via brain games","armGroupLabels":["aphasia therapy + brain games"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"aphasia therapy","description":"language exercises provided by the speech therapist in hospital","armGroupLabels":["aphasia therapy","aphasia therapy + brain games","aphasia therapy + speech app"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Boston Naming Test (BNT)","description":"Measure of word retrieval.
