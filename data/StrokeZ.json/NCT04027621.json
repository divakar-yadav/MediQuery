The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis. The control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis . Two groups will be followed up for 90 days to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning combined with intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"RIC+Standard medical treatment Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is induced by 4 cycles of 5 min of healthy upper limb ischemia followed by 5 min re-perfusion.
