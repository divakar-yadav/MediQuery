The heart rhythm of the patients is monitored with a CardioSTAT® Holter device (Icentia) for 14 days after the ischemic event onset. Based on this cardiac monitoring and previous medical history, patients are stratified into three groups: (a) atrial fibrillation detected after stroke or transient ischemic attack (AFDAS), (b) atrial fibrillation diagnosed before the ischemic event or known AF (KAF), and (c) normal sinus rhythm (NSR).\n\nAutonomic function is assessed by the levels of plasma catecholamines, a battery of validated autonomic tests \\[autonomic reflex screening (ARS)\\], heart rate variability (HRV) through data obtained by Holter monitoring by standard quantitative analysis methods according to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology and by the analysis of diurnal variation of heart rate. Blood samples are collected for the analysis of inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and potential AFDAS predictors such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP- AFDAS biomarker), endothelin-1 (endothelial dysfunction marker), Lipoprotein(a) \\[Lp(a)\\] and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) plasma levels, TAFI activity, TAFI single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), apo(a) isoform size and plasma catecholamines levels. Furthermore, specific neuroimaging findings (e.g., specific regions of the insula or its connections) and clinical features (e.g., impaired interoceptive processing, cognitive impairment, etc) are also analyzed. Interoception is assessed using a heartbeat detection task without feedback condition and gait, balance, frailty, and cognitive status in patients are evaluated by the administration of a battery of tests. Stroke recurrence will be assessed by a structured phone interview at 6 and 12 months after the initial stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Transient Ischemic Attack","Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Autonomic Dysfunction","Inflammation","Cognitive impairment","Interoception","Gait impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AFDAS","description":"patients without history of atrial fibrillation before the qualifying stroke or transient ischemic attack who are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation during the 14 days of monitoring"},{"label":"KAF","description":"atrial fibrillation known before the stroke or transient ischemic attack"},{"label":"NSR","description":"patients without a history of atrial fibrillation who do not develop atrial fibrillation during the 14 days of cardiac monitoring"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes and Differences in Autonomic Function","description":"Differences in Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) on an 11-point scale between patients with (a) AFDAS, (b) KAF , and (c) NSR","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours of stroke onset and at 12, 30 and 90 days."},{"measure":"Changes and Differences in Inflammatory Responses","description":"Differences in levels of plasma markers or temporal responses (CRP,TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, etc) between patients with (a) AFDAS, (b)KAF and (c) NSR.","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours of stroke onset and at 12, 30 and 90 days."},{"measure":"Changes and Differences in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)","description":"Differences in HRV parameters between patients with (a) AFDAS, and (b) NSR","timeFrame":"At 14 days."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Biomarkers","description":"Differences in levels of plasma markers (BNP,endothelin-1, Lp(a), and TAFI) or neuroimaging/clinical predictors between patients with (a) AFDAS , (b) KAF and (c) NSR","timeFrame":"Within 48 hours of stroke onset, at 12, 30 and 90 days and at 6 months."},{"measure":"Atrial Fibrillation Burden","description":"Difference in atrial fibrillation burden (sum of atrial fibrillation episodes for a period of time) of AFDAS subjects with mild stroke/TIA compared to AFDAS subjects with moderate/severe stroke.","timeFrame":"At 14 days"},{"measure":"Gait Impairments","description":"Differences in gait parameters in patients with a) AFDAS , (b) KAF and (c) NSR.","timeFrame":"At 6 months"},{"measure":"Frailty","description":"Differences in frailty in patients with (a) AFDAS , (b) KAF and (c) NSR","timeFrame":"At 6 months"},{"measure":"Cognitive Impairment","description":"Differences in cognition in patients with (a) AFDAS , (b) KAF and (c) NSR","timeFrame":"At 6 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Recurrence","description":"Number of stroke recurrences in patients with (a) AFDAS , (b) KAF and (c) NSR","timeFrame":"At 90, 180, and 360 days"},{"measure":"Death","description":"Number of deaths in (a) AFDAS , (b) KAF and (c) NSR groups","timeFrame":"At 90, 180, and 360 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
