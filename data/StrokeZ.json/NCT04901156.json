One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences, often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.\n\nIn most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand the mechanisms underlying recovery. Responses to rTMS have been positive, yet heterogenous, which may be related to timing of treatments following stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia, Non-fluent"],"keywords":["Non-invasive brain stimulation","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Multi-modality aphasia therapy","Neuroimaging","Stroke","Aphasia","Aphasia, Broca","Speech Disorders","Language Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Multi-modality aphasia therapy plus 1Hz rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Chronic stroke patients, receive 10 days of 3.5hrs of multi-modality aphasia therapy (M-MAT) preceded by 20 minutes of 1Hz rTMS delivered at 100% of resting motor threshold over the right pars triangularis.","interventionNames":["Device: 1Hz inhibitory rTMS","Behavioral: Multi-Modality Aphasia Therapy (M-MAT)"]},{"label":"Multi-modality aphasia therapy plus sham rTMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Chronic stroke patients, receive 10 days of 3.5hrs of multi-modality aphasia therapy (M-MAT) preceded by 20 minutes of sham rTMS is achieved using a sham TMS coil which attenuates the magnetic output of the stimulator by 80%.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Multi-Modality Aphasia Therapy (M-MAT)","Device: 1Hz sham rTMS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"1Hz inhibitory rTMS","description":"20 minutes of 1Hz (1200 pulses) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied by Magstim Rapid 2 stimulator equipped with an airfilm figure-8 coil","armGroupLabels":["Multi-modality aphasia therapy plus 1Hz rTMS"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Multi-Modality Aphasia Therapy (M-MAT)","description":"Participants receive 3.5 hours of intensive speech therapy in small groups delivered by a blinded speech language pathologist and therapy assistant.
