Renal impairment is a risk factor for stroke, its progression is associated with unfavorable prognosis. So preserving kidney function should be considered as a one of priorities when choosing treatment strategies which is especially important in patients with existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or in patients who have risk of its development. This is especially relevant for the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with CKD who can be considered as a group of risk for rapid kidney function decline.","detailedDescription":"It is suggested that the decline in renal function may occur more slowly in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) compared to patients taking warfarin. The planned trial is a prospective phase IV randomized trial in which patients with AF, T2DM and CKD will be randomized to groups receiving either dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin. The main goal of the study is to assess the differences in annual eGFR reduction between patients receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin for 24 months. The difference in annual eGFR reduction will be estimated using the SMPI parameters (mixed model of repeated measurements). Secondary goals are as follows: - to evaluate the progression of albuminuria during treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin based on the combined endpoint; - to evaluate the dynamics of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in urine during 2 years of treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin; - to evaluate bleeding episodes, acute cerebrovascular accident, and systemic embolism in the dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) and warfarin groups; - to compare glycemic control (HbA1c) in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) and warfarin"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus)","Chronic Kidney Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dabigatran etexilate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) 110 mg b.i.d. or 150 mg b.i.d. according SmPC during 2 years","interventionNames":["Drug: Dabigatran Etexilate"]},{"label":"Warfarin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Warfarin under the control of INR once a month (target range 2.0 - 3.0) during 2 years","interventionNames":["Drug: Dabigatran Etexilate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dabigatran Etexilate","description":"Study drug dabigatran etexilate.
