As a secondary outcome, this RCT aims to investigate if KT could improve functional recovery and delay the onset of spasticity.\n\nThe study consists in two parallel groups of 15 participants each. The treatment and observation period will last 1 month.","detailedDescription":"The following RCT single blind study will be performed in the Rehabilitative Operative Unit 4 of the I.R.C.C.S. Fondazione Santa Lucia in Rome, Italy. It aims to investigate the effectiveness of the early use of Kinesio-taping (KT) together with standard physiotherapy treatment, in the prevention of shoulder pain of the hemiplegic upper limb following a cerebral stroke, in the subacute phase. As a secondary outcome, a potential impact on functional recovery and on the onset of spasticity affecting the muscles of the upper limb will be evaluated. The early application of KT aims to prevent subluxation of the hemiplegic shoulder and therefore pain secondary to the prolonged mechanical stress of the capsulo-ligamentous and tendon structures, due to the weight of the limb in the antigravity position. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled by the investigators and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG, as part of the standard treatment, will be subject to a total of 4 applications of KT, each of which to be kept for 5 days a week followed by 2 days of rest, to safeguard skin integrity before a further application. The participants will be evaluated for eligibility at the admission after discharge from the Stroke Units of the local district area. The KT application will be carried out at an early stage, immediately after enrollment and possibly before the painful symptoms and subluxation are overt. The CG will undergo a KT application on the deltoid without support function, with the same frequency and duration as the EG (sham-application). The outcomes that will be evaluated are: the intensity of perceived pain (Ritchie Articular Index - RAI), the functionality of the upper limb (Fugl-Meyer Assessment - FMA-UE) and the presence of hypertonus in the muscles of the upper limb (modified Ashwort scale - MAS). The treatment lasted 4 weeks and the timing of data collection was organized as follows: T (0) - the initial assessment immediately after enrollment; T (1) - the intermediate evaluation performed before the fifth rehabilitation treatment; T (2) - the final evaluation performed at the end of the 8 treatments. Follow-up after discharge cannot currently be predicted due to hospital access restrictions due to the COVID pandemic."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Kinesio tape","Pain","Preventative Care","Spasticity","Muscle","Stroke","Rehabilitation","Functional Performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Kinesio-taping Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Conventional rehabilitative treatment (consisting in two treatments per day of 40 minutes each) plus a bi-weekly treatment focused on the joint complex of the shoulder plus Kinesio-taping (KT) treatment.\n\nThe Kinesio-taping treatment consists in 4 applications of KT on the affected shoulder to be held for 5 days a week, followed by 2 days of rest to safeguard skin integrity before a further application.\n\n5 KT strips with graded tensions will be placed on the following muscles:\n\n1. supraspinatus with a tension of 70%.\n2. infraspinatus with a tension of 70%. 3,4,5) deltoid (3 strips, 50% of tension) A sixth application with a tension of 90% originates at the level of the anterior face of the humeral head and it ends to the lower corner of the scapula.","interventionNames":["Device: Kinesio Tape Group"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional rehabilitative treatment (consisting in two treatments per day of 40 minutes each), plus a bi-weekly treatment focused on the joint complex of the shoulder, plus shame KT treatment.\n\n- The CG will undergo a KT application on the deltoid but without support function with the same frequency and duration as the experimental group (shame-application).","interventionNames":["Device: Control Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Kinesio Tape Group","description":"The application of the KT consists of 6 strips of I-shaped tape adhered to the skin areas of the shoulder","armGroupLabels":["Kinesio-taping Group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Control Group","description":"KT application on the deltoid but without support function","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To assess the change of Ritchie Articular Index","description":"The Ritchie Articular Index (RAI) is an 4 point index for the numerical measurement of joint tenderness.
