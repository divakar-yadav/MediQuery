This study is the randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Total 10 patients will be allocated randomly to either real virtual prism adaptation therapy or sham therapy with the wash-out period of more than 2 weeks. Two sessions (20min/session) per day, for 5days (total 10 sessions) will be provided. Behavioral outcomes will be measured before and after completing a total of 10 sessions therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Recovery of Function","Rehabilitation","Perceptual Disorders","Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Prism Adaptation Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will be provided with real virtual prism adaptation therapy.
