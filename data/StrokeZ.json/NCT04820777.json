Task specific exercises are important part of the fall intervention in daily activities of life should be incorporated during the rehabilitative services Objective: Effects of perturbation based balance training in reactive balance control in chronic stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"RCT (Randomized Control Trail) study was conducted. Stroke patients who have impaired balance and reactive control were determined on inclusion \\& exclusion criteria. Stroke patients with impaired balance control were arbitrarily allocated into two groups with one control and one interventional group ages ranged from 45 to 50 years. The sample size was 20 patients. Group 1 (control group) received tradional balance training and Group 2 (interventional group) received perturbation based training for balance control. The interval of treatment was 6 weeks. Data is collected from Azra Naheed Medical college (Ch Muhammad Akram teaching \\& research hospital) Lahore and Physiotherapy department of Social security hospital manga mandi Lahore. Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA),Time up and go (TUG) and Activity specific balance confidence (ABC) was used to evaluate the pre and post values of balance control."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Perturbation based training","Fall","Berg balance scale","Performance oriented mobility assessment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"perturbation based training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"External perturbations occur by forces outside the patient' control (e.g., a push or pull from the physiotherapist).
