And study the evolution of the effects of virtual reality with the repetition of the sessions.","detailedDescription":"Botulinum toxin injections is very frequently used in the treatment of spasticity after central neurological damage (stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, head trauma). The injections may be painful and the tolerance of the injections varies from one patient to another. The pain felt during the injection causes in most patients great stress during the injection.\n\nVirtual reality is a video technique with 360 ° vision simulating the physical presence of the patient in an \"existing\" environment outside the hospital setting. This technique has been used in painful procedures but only one publication, in pediatrics, has shown a decrease in pain and agitation during botulinum toxin injections.\n\nThe hypothesis of this research is that an immersive virtual reality system can, in adults, reduce stress and the painful experience of botulinum toxin injections."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Central Neurogical Impairment"],"keywords":["central neurological impairment (stroke, multiple sclerosis)","virtual reality mask","spasticity","botulinum toxin injections","stress","pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be selected during the physical medicine and rehabilitation consultation of the MPR department.
