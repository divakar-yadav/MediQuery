Pharmacological experiments confirmed that AngongNiuhuang pill can protect blood-brain barrier, reduce capillary permeability, improve the tolerance of cerebral ischemia and hypoxia, improve oxidative stress injury, thus protecting brain tissue. Clinical studies have also confirmed that AngongNiuhuang pill can increase the GCS score, reduce coma, improve nerve function defect and promote nerve function recovery. The primary purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of AngongNiuhuang pill and placebo on the improvement of life function in patients with ischemic stroke at 90 days in acute phase.","detailedDescription":"This trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled, multiple-center trial. A total of approximately 100 patients (18 years ≤age ≤80 years) within 24 hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who shows NIHSS from 5-20 points. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive AngongNiuhuang pill 1 pill 1 times/day for 5-day; 2) the other group will receive Placebo of AngongNiuhuang pill 1 pill 1 times/day for 5-day.The primary purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of AngongNiuhuang pill and placebo on the improvement of life function in patients with ischemic stroke at 90 days in acute phase. The study consists of five visits including the day of randomization, 2-6 days, monitor daily temperature, 7 days when the therapy is done, 30 days, and 90 days when the follow-up is finished. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the program. The improvement of life function will be assessed by Modified Rankin Scale(namely score=0-2). The trial is anticipated to last from July 2018 to December 2019 with 100 subjects recruited form 5 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese GCP standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","AngongNiuhuang pill"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AngongNiuhuang","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drugs: AngongNiuhuang pill.
