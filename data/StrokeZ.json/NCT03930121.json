This highlights the pressing need to explore adjunct strategies, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), to enhance training effectiveness. Recently, the investigators provided evidence from a single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggesting that anodal-tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1) improves naming and communication ability in chronic post-stroke aphasia, with medium-to-large effect sizes. However, prior to integration into clinical routine, a multi-center RCT with adequate power, duration, and outcomes relevant to everyday life is required, which is the goal of the present study. After trial completion, a workshop with relevant stakeholders will ensure transfer into best-practice guidelines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia","Post-stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Intensive speech-language therapy","Transcranial direct current stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two daily sessions of intensive speech-language therapy combined with transcranial direct current stimulation of the left primary motor cortex (M1)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":130,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with speech-language therapy (SLT, including naming therapy and communicative-pragmatic therapy)","interventionNames":["Other: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with speech-language therapy (SLT, including naming therapy and communicative-pragmatic therapy)"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo stimulation (using sham-tDCS) combined with SLT","interventionNames":["Other: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with speech-language therapy (SLT, including naming therapy and communicative-pragmatic therapy)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with speech-language therapy (SLT, including naming therapy and communicative-pragmatic therapy)","description":"Two daily sessions of intensive SLT combined with tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1)","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in communication ability, as assessed by the Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test","description":"Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (A-scale; parallel versions used in counterbalanced order across participants); cf.
