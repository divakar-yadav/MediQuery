It is a relatively safe agent with interesting neurochemical effects on the catecholamine system, producing an improvement in cognitive function, particularly working memory in humans. When combined with intensive task-related training, armodafinil may accelerate motor recovery in chronic stroke patients.\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to determine whether administration of armodafinil during subacute post-stroke rehabilitation will augment cortical plasticity and enhance motor recovery. The primary hypothesis suggests that cortical plasticity will be enhanced by armodafinil and, therefore, will induce an improvement in motor function and better performances on measures of motor control."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["stroke","CVA","cerebrovascular accident","hemiparesis","impairment","motor recovery","neuroplasticity","nuvigil","armodafinil"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":19,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Armodafinil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"150 mg armodafinil administered 2 hours prior to start of therapeutic regimen for 10 consecutive days","interventionNames":["Drug: Armodafinil"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"inactive agent administered 2 hours prior to start of therapeutic regimen for 10 consecutive days","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Armodafinil","armGroupLabels":["Armodafinil"],"otherNames":["Nuvigil"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"inactive pill manufactured to mimic Armodafinil 150 mg tablet","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Sensorimotor Function From Baseline to Day 100","description":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale is an index to assess the sensorimotor impairment in individuals who have had a stroke.The maximum possible score in Fugl-Meyer scale is 226, which corresponds to full sensory-motor recovery.
