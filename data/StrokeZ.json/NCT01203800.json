Transport across the BBB is strictly limited through both physical (tight junctions) and metabolic barriers (enzymes, diverse transport systems). BBB breakdown or alterations in transport systems play an important role in the pathogenesis of many CNS diseases (HIV-1 encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, tumors, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease).\n\nCerebral ischemia leads to disruption of blood flow, increased BBB permeability, and is associated with rapid depletion of essential nutrients and oxygen (2-3). Only a few studies were designed in humans in order to compare the degree of BBB changes and the neurological outcome after a stroke. The most significant stage of BBB breakdown occurs in humans within 48-72 hours post infarction and is accompanied by increased brain edema volume.\n\nThe investigators performed a study on thirty patients with acute stroke of the middle cerebral artery using technetium-99m-DTPA brain SPECT (4). Tc-99m-DTPA (Diethylenetriamine- pentacetic acid) brain scintigraphy is a useful technique for the assessment of BBB disruption. Is has been used in the past to localize areas within the cranium which had been disrupted by infection, neoplasms, trauma or stroke. The study showed that the magnitude of disruption of the BBB was negatively correlated with the change in neurological status with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 89%. Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with stroke (23%) had no gross evidence of BBB disruption, all of them with very good prognosis.\n\nIt is unclear for how long the BBB remains disrupted after a stroke, and whether there is any correlation between the BBB permeability and recurrent ischemic events or delayed functional and neurological outcome after a stroke.\n\nAim of the study\n\nIn this study the investigators intend to explore the long term significance of BBB disruption on the clinical course and the rate of significant recurrent ischemic events in patients with a chronic stroke.\n\nPatients and methods Inclusion criteria\n\nMale and female patients at any age with a history of a large stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, occurring 1-2 years ago or between 2-5 years ago.\n\nExlusion criteria\n\nMethods:\n\n40 patients will be recruited from the Neurological Outpatient Clinic of the Edith Wolfson Medical Center and from the Neurological Department.\n\nFor the SPECT study each patient will receive 740 MBq Tc-99m-DTPA and a SPECT study will be performed 60-90- minutes later. A dual head or a triple head gamma camera is usually used, equipped with high resolution collimators.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Persidsky Y, Ramirez SH, Haorah J, Kanmogne GD.
