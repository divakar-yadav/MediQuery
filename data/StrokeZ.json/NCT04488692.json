Participants in model 1 group will receive 2 sessions of functional training per day whereas those in model 2 group will receive 1 session of functional training and 1 session of friendly visit and education per day. The following outcomes will be measured at admission, at discharge and at 3 months post stroke: Barthel index (BI), Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS), Mobility Scale for Acute Stroke (MASA), and usual gait speed (UGS). The rater is blinded to participants' group membership."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":142,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Model 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 2 sessions of functional training per day, 15-min per session.","interventionNames":["Other: Early intervention (Mobility functional training)"]},{"label":"Model 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive 1 session of functional training and 1 session of sham intervention (therapist visiting and education) per day, 15-min per session.","interventionNames":["Other: Early intervention (Mobility functional training)","Other: Sham intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Early intervention (Mobility functional training)","description":"functional training focused on mobility (bed mobility, sitting balance, standing balance, and ambulation)","armGroupLabels":["Model 1","Model 2"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham intervention","description":"friendly visit and education","armGroupLabels":["Model 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patient (PASS)","description":"The total score range is 0 to 36 points.
