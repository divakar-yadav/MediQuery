Animal models provide promising evidence of minocycline's ability to improve outcomes in an animal stroke model.\n\nIn light of these findings, we will perform a double blind controlled study to investigate the efficacy of oral administration of 200 mg minocycline, on the neurological and functional outcome after acute hemorrhagic stroke and the effect on blood brain barrier permeability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Poor Performance Status"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke\n\n  1. age \\> 18\n  2.
