Up to date, it remains largely unknown as to the relationship between the integrity of the subcortical white matter with the lower extremity function recovery. Given the fact that the white matter is more resistant to ischemia after acute stroke than the gray matter (Falcao et al., 2004) and that the intensity of white matter in stroke has been found to be much greater in many brain areas in stroke than in healthy controls (Wen et al., 2004), it is of interest to study how the integrity of the subcortical white matter, primarily the corticospinal tracts and the corpus callosum, contributes to the recovery of lower extremity function in subacute and chronic stroke with lesions involving different areas of the brain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Diffusion spectrum tractography","Functional MRI (fMRI)","Lower extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"clinical assessments, included balance, motor, walking,ADL, will be obtained for tests performed on D7, D30 and D90","timeFrame":"D30, D90 and D180 post stroke onset"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* between 30 to 80 years old\n* diagnosis of the first-time onset of stroke as confirmed by imaging studies\n* within 30 days post onset University Hospital\n* brain lesions mainly involving either the cortical primary motor cortex (M1) area or confined to the subcortical (M1 spared)\n* No neurological or orthopedic problems which would affect their lower extremity function\n* no contraindications for MRI studies\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* medically unstable\n* unable to communicate with the experimenters","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"stroke patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pei-Fang Tang, PhD","affiliation":"National Taiwan University Hospital","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"School and Graduate Institute of Physical Therapy College of Medicine, National Taiwan University","city":"Taipei","state":"Taiwan","country":"China"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
