The primary objective of this study is to evaluate improvements in gait speed after four months of ET in comparison to conventional therapy for patients with sub-acute stroke. Secondary objectives involve assessing: i) modifications in neuromuscular parameters of PF, ii) changes in muscle stiffness within PF during passive mobilization and active force generation, and iii) modifications in architectural parameters of PF.","detailedDescription":"This study will be a single-blinded, controlled, randomized design, wherein participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Conventional Therapy Group (CTG) or the Eccentric Training Group (ETG). Both groups will undergo a comprehensive series of assessments at three key time points: Ji (initial assessment), Jint (intermediate assessment), and Jf (final assessment). The study will commence with a recruitment phase, followed by a screening phase. Subsequently, there will be a 4-week period allocated for experimental testing before the intervention, and an additional 4 weeks for experimental testing after the intervention. These assessments will encompass a wide range of evaluations, including clinical health assessments, biomechanical assessments, neuromuscular evaluations, and functional assessments"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Skeletal muscle","Eccentric strengthening"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CTG","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In conventional therapy, the treatment plan is determined based on medical opinion.
