The goals are to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of maximizing statin doses for two weeks (12-18 days) prior to CEA using change in performance on a battery neuropsychometric tests as outcome measure. Study will recruit patients based on their preexisting statin regimen.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that in asymptomatic CEA patients: 1) Pre-operative statin use is neuroprotective against early cognitive dysfunction (eCD) and lowers the risk of early mortality. 2) Maximal doses may be essential in achieving optimal neuroprotection against eCD.","detailedDescription":"Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a common surgery performed to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with carotid artery narrowing. Statins, a class of drugs usually used to lower blood cholesterol, may protect the brain after surgery. Specific statins have been shown to protect the brain after surgery when compared to others. eCD affects about 25% of patients undergoing CEA and about 15% of undergoing asymptomatic CEA. It is associated with marked elevations in tissue markers of cerebral injury and is associated with earlier post-CEA mortality. This clinically significant, but subtle, cerebral injury is 10 times more common than stroke and its mechanism appears to be similarly related to regional hypoperfusion and ischemia. It is imperative to determine in a prospective randomized trial whether alteration/increase of preoperative statin regimens leads to improved neurologic outcome and an even lower incidence of stroke and possibly greater survival.\n\nIn order to optimally design and conduct such a trial it is critical to: 1) explore the safety and feasibility of altering statin regimen acutely (approximately 2 weeks) before CEA, and 2) clearly establish the neuroprotective outcome of an acute alteration in statin regimen. This would promote a better understanding of statin neuroprotection in humans and determine the statin treatment that affords the most neuroprotection in patients undergoing one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Stenosis","Strokes"],"keywords":["Carotid endarterectomy","CEA","stroke","asymptomatic stenosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational - Maximal Dose - ARM 1","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients on a pre-existing maximal dose of either Simvastatin (40mg) with/without currently taking amlodipine (Norvasc) and those on Simvastatin 20mg while currently on amlodipine; Atorvastatin (80mg), or Rosuvastatin (20mg) regimen will be observed for \\~2 weeks before their CEA."},{"label":"Less Than Maximal Dose - ARM 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients on a pre-existing statin regimen at a lower dose (less than maximal) of Simvastatin \\<40mg without amlodipine and \\<20mg with amlodipine; Atorvastatin (\\<80mg) or Rosuvastatin (\\<20mg) will be randomized to maintain their current dose plus placebo or be increased to the maximal dose of their current statin for \\~2 weeks before their CEA.","interventionNames":["Drug: Statin","Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"Statin Naive - ARM 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients on no pre-existing statin regimen will be randomized to Atorvastatin 10 mg or Atorvastatin 80 mg for \\~2 weeks before their CEA","interventionNames":["Drug: Atorvastatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Statin","description":"Standard of care treatment (one of four):\n\n* Simvastatin (to 40mg without amlodipine)\n* Simvastatin (to 20 mg if currently on amlodipine)\n* Atorvastatin (to 80mg)\n* Rosuvastatin (to 20mg)","armGroupLabels":["Less Than Maximal Dose - ARM 2"],"otherNames":["Pre-existing statin regimen"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atorvastatin","description":"A lipid-lowering agent and for prevention of events associated with cardiovascular disease.\n\n10 mg or 80 mg capsules","armGroupLabels":["Statin Naive - ARM 3"],"otherNames":["Lipitor"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"A placebo pill will be used for patients that are to maintain their current dose of statins prior to their CEA.","armGroupLabels":["Less Than Maximal Dose - ARM 2"],"otherNames":["Sugar pill"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of eCD","description":"Neurocognitive assessments ≥2SD worse than reference group in two or more cognitive domains or (b) ≥1.5SD worse than the reference group in all cognitive domains.","timeFrame":"30 Days: 1) Pre-op vs. Post-CEA Day 1 (12-25 hrs post-op) and 2) Pre-op vs. Post-CEA Day 30"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prevalence of early mortality","description":"Data will be collected by follow up phone call","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
