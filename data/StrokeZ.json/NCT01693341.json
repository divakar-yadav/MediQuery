After returning home, stroke patients face new challenges and also need to assume more responsibility for daily activities. Without continuing rehabilitation training or proper support, the patients can easily fall into a sedentary lifestyle and lead to declines in functional ability.However, providing home-based exercise by therapists directly would increase the health care cost and may not be practical for chronic stroke patients. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine whether a caregiver-mediated, home-based intervention program is effective for improving stroke patients' functional ability and social participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Chronic stroke patients","Stroke rehabilitation","Caregiver","Caregiver-mediated intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Care-giver mediated training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Each patient and the caregiver of the intervention group received weekly home training and exercise counseling by a physical therapist about the caregiver mediated home exercise skill for stroke patient.
