Hypertension is significantly more prevalent in African Americans compared to European Americans. Importantly, hypertension is a modifiable stroke risk factor.\n\nThis proposal will use a community-based participatory research approach to perform a randomized trial of a mobile phone text-messaging intervention to reduce high blood pressure in an urban African American community in Flint, Michigan.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized controlled trial of text messaging and blood pressure
