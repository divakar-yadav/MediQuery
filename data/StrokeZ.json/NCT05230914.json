However, NCCT is more accessible when comparing with CTP. It is unclear whether the NCCT-based ASPECTS can be used as an imaging criterion to screen patients for thrombectomy.\n\nThe newly published MR CLEAN-LATE and TENSION trials used NCCT or CTA, but still relied on ASPECTS scores to evaluate and select patients for endovascular therapy. However, different trials have different time windows. The aim of this trial was to assess the clinical outcomes of stroke patients with anterior large vessel occlusion who selected by simple imaging (NCCT) comparing via standard imaging screening strategy (CTP/MRI). The hypothesis is that simple imaging is non-inferior to standard imaging selection strategy in terms of achieving favorable outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["endovascular treatment","large vessel occlusion","acute ischemic stroke","computed tomography perfusion","non-contrast computed tomography","Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Simple imaging","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"NCCT and CTA will be used to screen patients for endovascular treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Simplified imaging strategy"]},{"label":"Standard imaging","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"NCCT-ASPECTS (pc-ASPECTS), CTA, and CTP will be used to screen patients for endovascular treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Standard imaging strategy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Simplified imaging strategy","description":"NCCT and CTA will be used to screen patients for endovascular treatment","armGroupLabels":["Simple imaging"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard imaging strategy","description":"NCCT-ASPECTS (pc-ASPECTS), CTA, and CTP will be used to screen patients for endovascular treatment","armGroupLabels":["Standard imaging"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"favorable outcome at 90 days","description":"defined as modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 3.
