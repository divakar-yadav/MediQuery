Using the personalized brain functional sectors (pBFS) technique, we could precisely identify individualized brain functional networks and the personalized language-related stimulation site based on the resting-state functional MRI data. The current study proposes to conduct a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized and parallel controlled design trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of pBFS-guided personalized TMS intervention in post-stroke aphasic patients.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to the following two groups: active continuous TBS (cTBS) group, or a sham control group. The allocation ratio will be 2:1. Subjects will receive a 3-week treatment for 21 consecutive days. The stimulation procedure will be assisted with real-time neuronavigation to ensure its precision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active cTBS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"active cTBS combined with conventional rehabilitation therapy","interventionNames":["Device: active cTBS"]},{"label":"sham cTBS group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham cTBS combined with conventional rehabilitation therapy","interventionNames":["Device: sham cTBS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"active cTBS","description":"Each patient will receive three 600-pulse cTBS stimulations per day, parted by two 15-minute rest periods (a total of 1800 pulses daily), for 21 consecutive days (3 weeks).","armGroupLabels":["active cTBS group"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"sham cTBS","description":"Each patient will receive three 600-pulse sham cTBS stimulations per day, parted by two 15-minute rest periods (a total of 1800 pulses daily), for 21 consecutive days (3 weeks).","armGroupLabels":["sham cTBS group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the Western Aphasia Battery scores","description":"The first four subsets of the WAB (Spontaneous Speech, Auditory verbal comprehension, Repetition, Naming and word finding) will be used to evaluate the participants' language ability impairments.
