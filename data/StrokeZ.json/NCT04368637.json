The stress related to the pandemic, not the direct virus-related injury, can be potentially associated with acute cardiovascular events due to a large list of physical and psychosocial stresses.\n\nThis study is a cross sectional study that will enroll patients evaluated during the COVID19 pandemic period for acute cardiovascular events.","detailedDescription":"The onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a complex interplay of internal circadian factors and external physical and emotional triggers. These interactions may lead to rupture of an often non-occlusive vulnerable atherosclerotic coronary plaque with subsequent formation of an occlusive thrombus. Physical and emotional stresses are important triggers of acute cardiovascular events including AMI. Triggering events, internal changes, and external factors vary among different geographical, environmental, and ethnic regions. Life-style changes, pharmacotherapy, and psychological interventions may potentially modify the response to, and protect against the effects of triggering events. Certain times in the life span of different communities all around the world are prone to natural and man-made disasters that, not only have direct negative impact on human lives and state-resources, but also have indirect impact on triggering acute cardiovascular events during the time of the disaster and the period immediately after. For example, earthquakes, wars, and terrorist attacks, in addition to direct human life loss and destruction of communities, have bees associated with a surge in the number of acute MI, sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachy-arrhythmia and implantable cardiovertor defibrillators (ICD) discharges.\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has afflicted almost the whole globe. The virus can directly attack the myocyte and cause various degrees of cardiac damage and cardiovascular clinical entities. However, the stress related to the pandemic, not the direct virus-related injury, can be potentially associated with acute cardiovascular events due to a large list of physical and psycho-social stresses such as extreme physical effort, lock down, anger, fear, financial stress, sorrow, death of a significant person..etc.\n\nThis study is a cross sectional study that will enroll patients evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic period for acute cardiovascular events not directory related to the virus infectivity, who voice certain and specific trigger(s) related to the pandemic impact on social life and physical activity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Myocardial Infarction","Ventricular Tachycardia","Sudden Cardiac Death","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["COVID-19","triggered myocardial infarction","triggered acute cardiovascular events","COVID-19-related stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Acute cardiovascular event triggered by COVID-19 stress","description":"Acute myocardial infarction as diagnosed by ST segment elevation or depression or inverted T wave on 12-lead EKG and elevated levels of cardiac troponins above the 99% of the normal values.\n\nA.
