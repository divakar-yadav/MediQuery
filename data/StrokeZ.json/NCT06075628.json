It will be a multi-center, retrospective study. Approximately 100 subject charts will be reviewed.","detailedDescription":"Although the clinical significance of long-term left atrial appendage contrast flow (LAA-CF) in computerized tomography (CT) scan is unknown, study by Lim et al reported that 45 days are not enough for complete left atrial appendage (LAA) seal-off after left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in humans and anatomic closure may not necessarily ensure treatment success. Long-term monitoring is warranted in high-risk patients with LAAO after switching from anticoagulation to antiplatelet therapy. They reported possible explanations for residual LAA-CF after LAAO to be related to peri-device gaps, incomplete endothelialization on the device surface, an off-axis device, fabric leak through the non-endothelialized portion of the device.\n\nTo this date no studies or registries exist on long term follow up and association of Left Atrial Appendage Contrast Flow (LAA-CF). In this study with two FDA approved devices (Watchman/Watchman FLX and Amplatzer Amulet), it is hypothesized that the LAA contrast-flow (CF) rate is related to lack of endothelization of the implanted devices and potentially associated with peri-device leaks (PDLs), device related thrombosis (DRT)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Ischemic Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Amplatzer Amulet","description":"This is the group of subjects who are implanted with Amplatzer Amulet device.","interventionNames":["Other: Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion"]},{"label":"Watchman / Watchman FLX","description":"This is the group of subjects who are implanted with Watchman / Watchman FLX device.","interventionNames":["Other: Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion","description":"Acute ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (AF).

It is estimated that around 50% of patients who have AF with indication for OAC end up being not on OAC due to bleeding complications leaving them at high risk for developing STE.
