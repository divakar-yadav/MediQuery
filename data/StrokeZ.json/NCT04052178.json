Higher latency (0 onwards) means worse outcome and higher amplitude (0 onwards) means better outcome.\n* Pharyngeal motor evoked potentials (pMEP): latency, amplitude, duration and area of obtained evoked potentials. Higher latency (0 onwards) means worse outcome and higher amplitude (0 onwards) means better outcome.\n\nTreatments and patients: 36 post-stroke patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (PAS superior or equal to 2) randomized patients in 3 treatment arms (3 groups of 12 patients).\n\n* Active and sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): 90% of the resting motor threshold, 1250 pulses, 5 Hz.\n* Active and sham Intrapharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES): 75% of tolerance threshold, pulses of 0.2 ms, 5 Hz, 10 min.\n* Oral Capsaicin (active intervention, 10-5M, TRPV1 agonist) and placebo solution (sham): 100 mL, single administration.\n\nAdministration of study therapies:\n\nThe study will be performed in two visits separated for one week. In each visit patients will randomly receive active or sham treatment and a pre-post evaluation of biomechanics of deglutition (with VFS) and neurophysiological mechanisms (swallowing afferent and efferent pathways) will be performed in each visit.\n\nAcute randomized administration -\\> 1 active session (pre/post evaluation with VFS/pSEP/pMEP) + 1 separate control session 1 week apart (pre/post evaluation with VFS/pSEP/pMEP)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Swallowing Disorder","Dysphagia","Stroke","Neurophysiologic Abnormality"],"keywords":["Oropharyngeal dysphagia","Stroke","Sensory stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtMS)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Acute repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the pharyngeal sensory cortex.
