Is the proposed treatment safe\n2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients after Stroke and clinical outcomes?","detailedDescription":"Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASCs) are a novel therapy for patients suffering from stroke. By injecting ASCs either into the internal carotid artery, these regions may become populated with the ASCs, thereby potentially restoring brain function. ASCs are a patient-derived (\"autologous\") cell transplantation technology that is delivered to the patient into the internal carotid artery and intravenously. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately delivered back to the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Harvesting and Isolation of Stem Cells","description":"This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of ASC implantation using a catheter delivery system.
