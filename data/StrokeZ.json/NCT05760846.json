The recovery from motor impairment has been extensively studied, but it is currently unknown whether motor skill learning (MSkL) is enhanced or impaired during acute stroke, especially bimanual motor skill learning (bim-MSkL), which likely requires more motor-attentional-cognitive resources than unimanual MSkL.\n\nThe goals of this project are: to determine the neural substrates critical to achieve proximal and distal bimanual motor skill learning (bim-MSkL) by specifying whether (sub)acute stroke to different brain areas (cortical and subcortical) induce specific deficits in bimanual and/or distal bim-MSkL, which behavioral components are involved in bim-MSkL, and whether damage to the motor, sensory and inter-hemispheric pathways specifically impairs proximal and/or distal bim-MSkL.","detailedDescription":"Over 3 consecutive days, the patients will be evaluated and will train on the rehabilitation robot REAplan® (http://www.axinesis.com/) to assess proximal bim-MSkL and on the manual dexterity tool Dextrain Manipulandum (https://www.dextrain.com/) to assess distal bim-MSkL.\n\nFor proximal bim-MSkL, patients will train over the 3 days on the serious game Circuit on the bimanual REAplan® and will be randomised to two different bimanual versions. By this means, the investigators will explore the components of bim-MSkL in acute stroke patients.\n\nThe motor skill learning setup (Circuit) that was developed and successfully used in healthy individuals and stroke patients has already been implemented in the REAplan® environment and will be used as innovative serious games based on a speed/accuracy trade-off (SAT), allowing a detailed analysis of motor skill learning components (speed, accuracy, SAT, movement smoothness, dynamics...). For the serious game Circuit, who based on motor skill learning, the subjects will have to practice a complex circuit and move a cursor as quickly and accurately as possible by controlling the handles of the robot with both arms.\n\nFor distal bim-MSkL, patients will train on a complex sequence of finger movements involving both hands. Each day, several successive repetitions of the sequence will be displayed, corresponding to one block. 3 to 6 blocks will be repeated, each separated by 30 sec of rest. After training on the third day, a new sequence will be repeated for 3 blocks to assess generalization.\n\nTo explore the role of different brain structures in bim-MskL, Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) based on high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, will be used to analyse the relationship between tissue damage and proximal/distal bim-MskL scores on a voxel-by-voxel basis.\n\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will quantify the integrity of several white matter tracts, allowing through correlation analyses to unveil the white matter tracts crucial to achieve proximal and/or distal bim-MskL.\n\nIn addition, several \"classical\" clinical scales and tests will be used to evaluate overall motor-sensory-cognitive functions.\n\nIn addition to the (sub)acute stroke patients, a group of healthy individuals who will not undergo MRI (n=60) will be enrolled as control group. Subjects in this group will also be randomized 1/1 in the two versions of the bimanual Circuit task on the REAplan® robot."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Stroke, Subacute"],"keywords":["Motor Skill Learning","Upper limb","Acute stroke","Rehabilitation","Subacute stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Not aware being of the different versions of the tasks","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bimanual Circuit version 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Training on the REAplan® robot with a serious game based on proximal motor skill learning (bim-MSkL) with the bimanual version 1 of the Circuit task and training on the Dextrain Manipulandum with a serious game based on distal bim-MSkL","interventionNames":["Device: REAplan®","Device: Dextrain Manipulandum®"]},{"label":"Bimanual Circuit version 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Training on the REAplan® robot with a serious game based on motor skill learning (MSkL) with bimanual version 2 of the Circuit task and training on the Dextrain Manipulandum with a serious game based on distal bim-MSkL","interventionNames":["Device: REAplan®","Device: Dextrain Manipulandum®"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"REAplan®","description":"motor skill learning with the REAplan® rehabilitation robot, to be performed with both arms","armGroupLabels":["Bimanual Circuit version 1","Bimanual Circuit version 2"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Dextrain Manipulandum®","description":"motor skill learning with the Dextrain Manipulandum® dexterity tool to be performed with both hands","armGroupLabels":["Bimanual Circuit version 1","Bimanual Circuit version 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"bimanual Speed/Accuracy Trade-off (bi-SAT), bimanual Speed/Accuracy Trade-off measured by the REAplan® robot","description":"bimanual Speed/Accuracy Trade-off: mathematical computation of the relationship between speed and accuracy","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"bimanual Coordination factor (bi-CO), bimanual Coordination factor measured by the REAplan® robot","description":"bimanual Coordination factor, mathematical measure of the phase coherence between speeds of both arms","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"bi-Force, bimanual force measured by the REAplan® robot","description":"bimanual forces, forces exerted in the wrong direction by each arm (Newtons)","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bimanual root mean square error measured by the Dextrain Manipulandum","description":"Tracking error between the actual applied force and the target force","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"Bimanual Dexterity Coordination Index measured by the Dextrain Manipulandum","description":"bimanual Coordination factor, mathematical measure of the phase coherence between speeds of both thumb-index clamps","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reaction time measured by the Dextrain Manipulandum","description":"time between the target appearance and when the force applied exceeds threshold","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"Rise time measured by the Dextrain Manipulandum","description":"time between the reaction time and reaching the plateau","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"Coactivation measured by the Dextrain Manipulandum","description":"binary measure of unasked fingers activated above the force threshold","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"Hold time measured by the Dextrain Manipulandum","description":"time of plateau maintenance","timeFrame":"change between baseline (Day 1) and after training (Day 3)"},{"measure":"Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM)","description":"Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)","description":"Fractional Anisotropy","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity Test (FMA-UE)","description":"Tests impairments of the upper limb after stroke.
