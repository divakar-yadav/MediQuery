There has been no observed increase in hemorrhagic complications. Recently, a prospective study has been published where treatment with two ST has been shown to be effective and safe if used as a first-choice treatment (not as rescue) with a successful recanalization rate (eTICI 2c/3) after the first pass of 69%. These results have been reinforced after the publication of a randomized study that confirms, in vitro, the superiority of using two ST over one.","detailedDescription":"The use of a double stent retriever has been proposed as a safe and effective technique. The investigators hypothesized that the use of double stentriever primary could lead to higher first pass effect rates and better outcomes compared to single stentriever primary.\n\nOur goal is to develop a research project to provide additional information on the potential benefits of the simultaneous double stent approach primarily in stroke patients receiving endovascular treatment.\n\nA randomized study to compare the efficacy of double primary stentriever versus single primary stentriever."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Thrombectomy","Arterial Occlusive Diseases"],"keywords":["Stroke","Double Stentriever","Thrombectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Patient \\& Outcomes adjudicator","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Double stentriever technique","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients treated with thrombectomy with a proximal balloon guiding catheter using two stentrievers simultaneously (one of 6 mm x 50 mm and another of 6 mm x 50 mm or 4 mm x 35 mm)","interventionNames":["Device: Double stentriever"]},{"label":"Single stentriever technique","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients treated with thrombectomy with a proximal balloon guiding catheter using one stentriever (6 mm x 50 mm).","interventionNames":["Device: Single stentriever"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Double stentriever","description":"Double stentriever technique","armGroupLabels":["Double stentriever technique"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Single stentriever","description":"Single stentriever technique","armGroupLabels":["Single stentriever technique"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"EFFECTIVENESS OBJECTIVE: Complete recanalization on first pass","description":"Comparison of the complete recanalization rate in the first pass in the double stent group compared to the single stent group, defined as TICI greater than 2c on the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale (eTICI scale).","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"SAFETY OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral hemorrhage.","description":"Rate of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (neurological deterioration in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \\[NIHSS\\] \\>4) at 24h observed between both groups and, fundamentally, evaluated by CT.","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intervention success.","description":"Rate of the ability to position both STs in the indicated location.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Complications related to the intervention.","description":"Evaluation of the rate of arterial perforation, angiographic extravasation of contrast, arterial dissection or arterial vasospasm.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Embolism in new territories.","description":"Rate of embolization to an artery not involved in the initially affected territory.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Number of passes with the devices.","description":"Evaluation of the number of passes with the devices during the procedure.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Procedure time.","description":"Time from arterial puncture to arterial recanalization, or if not achieved, until the end of the intervention.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Arterial Recanalization (eTICI scale) on first pass.","description":"evaluation of the rates of eTICI 3, eTICI 2c/3, eTICI e2b/3 on the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale (e TICI scale); range 0-3, with highest score indicating complete recanalization.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Arterial recanalization at the end of the procedures.","description":"eTICI 3, eTICI e2c/3, eTICI e2b/3 at the end of the procedure on the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale (e TICI scale); range 0-3, with highest score indicating complete recanalization.","timeFrame":"During the procedure"},{"measure":"Intracerebral hemorrhage.","description":"Rate of any type of intracranial hemorrhage on the 24-hour control computed tomography (CT) scan (subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhage according to the classification used in the ECASS study).","timeFrame":"24 hours"},{"measure":"Early neurological improvement.","description":"Rate of patients with a decrease of 10 points or more on the NIHSS scale or complete recovery during the first 24 hours.
