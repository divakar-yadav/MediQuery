prepare clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 4-channel electric stimulation therapy devices as a newly developed function for the treatment of dysphagia disorders.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in effect by the electric stimulation method and to obtain the values such as mean, standard deviation and so on, and to determine the number of subjects to be studied for clinical trials of validation permission in the future.","detailedDescription":"* Design: Prospective study\n* Inclusion criteria of patient group: who has a dysphagia
