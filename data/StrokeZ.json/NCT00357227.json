But even more frequent than symptomatic strokes are silent infarctions of the brain. Silent strokes remain undetected in most cases, but cumulate over time and progressively impair cognition. The impact of atrial fibrillation on subacute brain infarctions is not yet known. Moreover, it has not been elucidated so far how effective different therapeutic strategies in the treatment of atrial fibrillation prevent cognitive impairment. Thus, this study aims at evaluating the influence of different types of atrial fibrillation on silent strokes and the related impairment in cognitive functions. Other risk factors and cardiovascular diseases that are known to provoke the development of strokes will be assessed as well. So, it will be possible to isolate the contribution of atrial fibrillation to silent strokes and related cognitive impairment in segregation to other relevant factors. AF patients and controls will be examined twice in two years in order to evaluate the role of atrial fibrillation and differential therapeutic interventions with regard to the progression of silent strokes and cognitive impairment in a within subject-design."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Atrial fibrillation","Stroke","Vascular Dementia","Mild Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"DEFINED_POPULATION","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of permanent, paroxysmal or episodic atrial fibrillation in the past or at present\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pacemaker\n* Metal implants\n* History of acute stroke\n* Diagnosis of vascular or degenerative dementia\n* History of brain tumors\n* History of severe brain injury\n* History of psychiatric disorders\n* Pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Stefan Knecht, Prof.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+49-251-83-","phoneExt":"48195","email":"knecht@uni-muenster.de"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Stefan Knecht, Prof.","affiliation":"University Hospital Münster, Department of Neurology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Münster, Dept. of Neurology","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Münster","state":"NRW","zip":"48149","country":"Germany","contacts":[{"name":"Stefan Knecht, Prof.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.96236,"lon":7.62571}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6594","name":"Dementia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M29395","name":"Cognitive Dysfunction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17551","name":"Dementia, Vascular","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
