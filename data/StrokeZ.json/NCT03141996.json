Such patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left. This study is being done to learn if vibration treatment can improve visual/spatial neglect and activities of daily living in stroke patients better than current standard intervention.This treatment will be performed by occupational therapist practitioners prior to regular occupational therapy session using a vibration tool."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Unilateral Spatial Neglect"],"keywords":["vibration","stroke","activities of daily living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vibration to upper posterior neck muscles","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment will be performed by occupational therapist practitioners prior to regular occupational therapy session using a vibration tool.","interventionNames":["Other: Vibration to upper posterior neck muscles"]},{"label":"Standard of care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Regular occupational therapy session","interventionNames":["Other: Standard of Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Vibration to upper posterior neck muscles","description":"Vibration to upper posterior neck muscles using a vibrational tool.","armGroupLabels":["Vibration to upper posterior neck muscles"],"otherNames":["Magic Wand Massager"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard of Care","description":"Standard of care treatment","armGroupLabels":["Standard of care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Behavioral Inattention test","description":"A short screening battery of tests to assess the presence and the extent of visual neglect on a sample of everyday problems faced by patients","timeFrame":"Day 0"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Behavioral Inattention test","description":"A short screening battery of tests to assess the presence and the extent of visual neglect on a sample of everyday problems faced by patients","timeFrame":"Day 30"},{"measure":"Behavioral Inattention test","description":"A short screening battery of tests to assess the presence and the extent of visual neglect on a sample of everyday problems faced by patients","timeFrame":"Day 60"},{"measure":"Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)","description":"a standardized checklist to detect presence and degree of unilateral neglect during observation of everyday life situations.","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)","description":"a standardized checklist to detect presence and degree of unilateral neglect during observation of everyday life situations.","timeFrame":"Day 30"},{"measure":"Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)","description":"a standardized checklist to detect presence and degree of unilateral neglect during observation of everyday life situations.","timeFrame":"Day 90"},{"measure":"Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)","description":"AM-PAC measures patients' capabilities in functional areas for prioritization of therapy resources.","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)","description":"AM-PAC measures patients' capabilities in functional areas for prioritization of therapy resources.","timeFrame":"Day 30"},{"measure":"Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)","description":"AM-PAC measures patients' capabilities in functional areas for prioritization of therapy resources.","timeFrame":"Day 60"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years old or older\n* demonstrated visual/spatial neglect, as demonstrated by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and deficits in assessing tactile extinction and visuospatial neglect done on admission.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe pain or skin disease at the posterior neck\n* severe atherosclerosis of carotid arteries by an ultrasonic evaluation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Florentina Mueller-Planitz","affiliation":"Intermountain Health Care, Inc.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Intermountain Medical Center","city":"Murray","state":"Utah","zip":"84157","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.66689,"lon":-111.88799}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34196963","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Longley V, Hazelton C, Heal C, Pollock A, Woodward-Nutt K, Mitchell C, Pobric G, Vail A, Bowen A.
