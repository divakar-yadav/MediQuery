Stroke frequency grows exponentially with aging and its incidence doubles every decade over 55 years of age.\n\nThe prognosis of ischemic stroke depends mainly on the care in Stroke Units in the acute phase of the disease (thrombolysis/thrombectomy). It is important that HIV patients are referred to these units in the first hours of a stroke and not to their infectious disease units which is a loss of chance.\n\nIt would also be important to know whether HIV patients need specific protocols for stroke emergency management.\n\nThe study aims to compare the functional prognosis after the first occurrence of an ischemic stroke, in patients admitted to a Stroke Unit, whether they are infected or not infected by HIV."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident, Acute","HIV"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HIV patients","description":"HIV patients admitted in Stroke units for the first occurence of acute stroke","interventionNames":["Other: stroke center referral"]},{"label":"non HIV patients","description":"non HIV patients admitted in Stroke units for the first occurence of acute stroke","interventionNames":["Other: stroke center referral"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"stroke center referral","armGroupLabels":["HIV patients","non HIV patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"degree of disability measured with the modified Rankin Scale","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients unexposed to HIV: HIV-1 seronegative OR patients exposed to HIV: HIV seropositive for over 6 months with or without antiretroviral treatment.
