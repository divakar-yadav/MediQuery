The protocol may be used as a pilot for large-scale studies attempting to evaluate the CVH of rural or even urban centers of Latin America, to implement cost-effective strategies directed to reduce the burden of stroke and cardiovascular diseases in the population at large.","detailedDescription":"This is a 3-phase epidemiological study. During Phase I, two general physicians and a nurse will perform a door-to-door survey of all Atahualpa residents aged ≥ 40 years. These persons will be eligible for being screened with standardized questionnaires to identify those with suspected stroke or ischemic heart disease, and to evaluate their cardiovascular health (CVH). Persons will be directly interviewed unless aphasic or mentally impaired; in such cases, relatives or caregivers will answer the questions. We plan to use the epidemiologic method of capture-recapture to enhance the detection of all possible cases of stroke and ischemic heart disease \\[13\\]. So, besides the door-to-door survey, we will review the medical records from the only one health center of Atahualpa, as well as the original files of our survey performed in 2003 at the same village \\[12\\].\n\nIn Phase II, certified neurologists and cardiologists will move to Atahualpa to examine all individuals who screened as suspected cases of stroke or ischemic heart disease. In addition, a random sample of 2% of individuals who were considered negative during the screening phase (matched by age and gender to suspected cases) will also undergo a complete neurologic and cardiologic examination to assess possible false negative cases during the survey. In Phase III, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke and ischemic heart disease will be invited to undergo further examination in Guayaquil."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Heart Disease"],"keywords":["stroke","myocardial infarction","cardiovascular health","population study"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":642,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atahualpa residents aged ≥ 40 years","description":"All Atahualpa residentes aged 40 ≥ years will be screened by field questionnaires.
