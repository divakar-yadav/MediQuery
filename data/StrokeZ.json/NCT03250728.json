And to study the protein C system on the surface of the endothelium.","detailedDescription":"The study consists in isolating endothelial progenitor cells in peripheral blood. After blood puncture, PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) are isolated by Ficoll gradient and then culturing in appropriated medium.\n\nWhen cells are confluent, investigators can study the endothelial barrier by using permeability assay and transendothelial resistance test (iCELLigence technology).\n\nThen, protein C system will be studied. Indeed, EPCR (Endothelial protein C receptor) and TM (thrombomodulin), are the two receptors responsible for the activation of protein C. The expression of these receptors will be assessed in flow cytometry. The activated protein C is able to interact with the third receptor PAR1 (Protease activated receptor 1) which is responsible for the protective effects of the on the endothelial barrier. The PAR1 expression will be studied in flow cytometry also.\n\nIn order to measure the capacity of the protein C system to generate activated protein C investigators will assay an activated protein C generation on the cell surface.\n\nAll these assays will be realized in basal condition and in heat stress (42°C), to mimic the stroke-like episode environment. Indeed, stroke-like episodes occur always during febrile illness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation"],"keywords":["CDG","Stroke-like","Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)","Protein C","Congenital Disorders og Glycosylation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CDG with stroke-like history","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Biological: Peripheral blood puncture"]},{"label":"CDG without stroke-like history","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Biological: Peripheral blood puncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Peripheral blood puncture","description":"Endothelial progenitor cells will be isolated from peripheral blood by density gradient and cultured in 10%FBS EGM2 medium\n\nOn the EPCs we will study:\n\n* the endothelial permeability\n* the protein C system","armGroupLabels":["CDG with stroke-like history","CDG without stroke-like history"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Endothelial permeability assay in basal condition","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Endothelial permeability assay after an heat shock","timeFrame":"at inclusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Activated protein C generation assay on the endothelial cell surface","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Quantification of the endothelial receptors (EPCR, TM, PAR1)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Endothelial permeability assay after an activated protein C incubation","timeFrame":"at inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients with CDG molecularly diagnosed\n* with stroke-like history or not\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* rejection to participate in research","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Pascale De Lonlay, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Delphine Borgel, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hopital Necker enfants malades","city":"Paris","zip":"75015","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000018981","term":"Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002239","term":"Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors"},{"id":"D000008661","term":"Metabolism, Inborn Errors"},{"id":"D000030342","term":"Genetic Diseases, Inborn"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20703","name":"Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation","asFound":"Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5188","name":"Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11331","name":"Metabolism, Inborn Errors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M23376","name":"Genetic Diseases, Inborn","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11329","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T1486","name":"Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation","asFound":"Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M14039","name":"Protein C","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"FiAg","name":"Fibrinolytic Agents"},{"abbrev":"AnCoag","name":"Anticoagulants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
