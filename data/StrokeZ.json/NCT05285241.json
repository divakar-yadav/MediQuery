Several kinds of research have reported that there has been asymmetrical weight bearing on the affected side while sitting and standing resulting in impaired performance especially reaching in sitting, rising from the chair, walking, and climbing stairs. Despite the stroke patient being able to walk independently with or without the walking aids, the patient still lacks the normal movement pattern especially weight transfers on the affected side while performing such activities which subsequently decreases the patient to restrain the challenges while walking, decrease confidence in functional activities. Also, further, there hasn't been enough literature on this topic. Therefore, the objective of this study is to find out the effectiveness of multidirectional stepping and weight shifting exercises to improve dynamic balance and gait speed in stroke patients.","detailedDescription":"The twenty-four subjects who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected for the study and were randomly assigned into two groups of 12 subjects each by simple random sampling based on inclusion criteria. First, all the subjects were assessed with a detailed neurological assessment form after the consent form was taken from the patients. The experimental group was given multidirectional stepping exercise with conventional therapy whereas are control group was given only conventional therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Balance","Gait","Berg balance scale","Functional gait assessment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two arms parallel design","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Multidirectional exercise group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Multidirectional stepping exercises along with conventional physiotherapy were provided to the patients.
