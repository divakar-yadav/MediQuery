Every day, surrogate decision-makers face the difficult \"goals of care\" decision in intensive care units (ICUs) to continue or withdraw life support while considering the patient's long-term prognosis. In this study, we will pilot test a pragmatic, scalable intervention to overcome ongoing problems with high stakes decision-making by surrogates of patients with SABI in ICUs. These problems are an important target for intervention, because they contribute to 3 major clinical and public health issues: 1) family members struggle in the role of surrogate, leading to lasting symptoms of psychological distress; 2) clinicians are poorly trained in communicating prognosis after SABI, often doing so with variability and bias, inadequately preparing families for their decisions; 3) patients often receive burdensome treatments that they would not choose.\n\nDecision aids improve the quality of patients' decisions based on a large evidence-base, but no empirically validated tools currently exist for surrogate decision-making in SABI patients at high risk for death or disability. This is problematic because surrogates of SABI patients are unprepared for the difficult decisions about the use of life support and patients' potential long-term disability, which hinge on both medical information and the patient's values and preferences. We have developed and refined a tailored digital, web-based decision aid (DA) for families of critically ill SABI patients, conceptually grounded in the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, to enhance, not replace, clinician-family communication. We will leverage a digital platform, which is portable and shareable among family members when geographically distant or not allowed to visit the ICU (as during the COVID-19 pandemic) and allows integration of videos to reach lower-literacy groups. This innovative tool challenges the existing paradigm for decision-making in SABI patients.\n\nThis pilot study among 50 surrogates of SABI patients and their clinicians will assess the feasibility of deploying the web-based tool as well as to explore the tools impact on measures of communication and decision-quality."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemorrhagic Stroke, Intracerebral","Acute Ischemic Stroke","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["shared decision making","physician-family communication","withdrawal of life sustaining therapies","patient-value congruent care","decision aid","neuroICU","neurocritical care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"stepped-wedge randomized trial (before-after study)","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Web-based Decision Aid + Communication (DA+C) tool","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Surrogate(s) will read/click through the DA+C tool prior to the clinician-family meeting and complete the integrated worksheet.
