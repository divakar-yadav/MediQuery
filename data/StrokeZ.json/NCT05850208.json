Routine treatment:\n\n   1.1. If arterial plaque is found, use lipid-lowering therapy (routine dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin). If no plaque is found, use atorvastatin or rosuvastatin based on the maintenance of normal blood lipid;\n\n   1.2. If venous thrombosis or arterial plaques are found in the lower limbs, use dabigatran to prevent platelet aggregation; if no vascular problems are found in the lower limbs, use aspirin or clopidogrel to prevent platelet aggregation;\n\n   1.3. During the treatment, cerebrovascular stenosis (non responsible vessels) can be treated intravascularly;\n\n   1.4. The use of neurotrophic drugs is prohibited during the study;\n\n   1.5. Elevated homocysteine was treated with mecobalamin and folic acid;\n\n   1.6. Hypertension, diabetes and other basic diseases receive routine treatment, and the combined medication is recorded in the case report form.\n2. Grouping:\n\n2.1.
