The overall goals of SPOTRIAS are to enhance delivery of acute stroke patient care and train acute stroke translational researchers.\n\nStroke most often occurs when blood flow to the brain stops because it is blocked by a blood clot. When a blood clot blocks the blood supply to the brain, parts of the brain may not get enough blood and oxygen to survive. As a result, permanent brain damage can occur, which can affect a person's ability to walk, talk, and function independently. In order to reduce the risk of permanent damage, it is important to restore blood flow to the brain as quickly as possible.\n\nrt-PA, used alone, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for patients with a stroke caused by blockage of an artery in the brain and when given within 3 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Eptifibatide is also already FDA-approved as a treatment for blood clots causing heart attack. The investigational aspect of this study is the use of eptifibatide for a stroke victim in combination with rt-PA.\n\nThe CLEAR Stroke Trial (NCT00250991) demonstrated that the combination of low dose rt-PA plus eptifibatide can be safely given to acute ischemic stroke patients within 3 hours of symptom onset.\n\nThe CLEAR-ER Stroke Trial is designed to provide data concerning the risks and benefits of combining eptifibatide with medium dose intravenous rt-PA in 126 acute ischemic stroke patients within 3 hours of symptom onset. Patients will be randomized to a combined intravenous medium-dose rt-PA and eptifibatide regimen, or standard dose rt-PA in a 5 to 1 ratio. This will result in a total of 105 patients treated with a combined regimen, and 21 patients treated with standard dose IV rt-PA alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Stroke","Brain Infarction"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","stroke","rt-PA, thrombolytic","t-PA","recombinant tissue plasminogen activator","Activase","eptifibatide","Integrilin","fibrinolytic agents","clot dissolving","blood clot"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rt-PA only","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subject will receive the standard dose (0.9mg/kg) of IV rt-PA given over 60 minutes.
