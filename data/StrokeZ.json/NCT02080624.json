SWS is characterized by a capillary vascular malformation (CM) localized on the skin of the face, eyes and central nervous system. Given the localization and the extent of the CM, children with SWS are particularly prone to developing severe psychological problems. The standard treatment for CM is pulsed dye laser (PDL) although in these cases whitening of the lesion is rarely achieved. Combining topical rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with PDL is hypothesised to be a good therapeutic option in these patients.","detailedDescription":"Patients with SWS will be treated with 2 sessions of PDL in the lateral part of the CM separated by an interval of 6 weeks and with 1% topical rapamycin or placebo in the superior or inferior half, both applied once a day for 12 weeks. The clinical response will be analyzed using a morphologic and chromatographic computerised system and with spectrometry. Histological response will be evaluated also. For that purpose, we will make 4 biopsies, one in each quadrant (quadrant treated with PDL and placebo, quadrant treated with PDL and rapamycin, quadrant treated only with rapamycin and quadrant treated only with placebo)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sturge- Weber Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rapamycin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Topical rapamycin applied once a day","interventionNames":["Drug: Drug: Topical Rapamycin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Drug: Topical Rapamycin","description":"After signing this consent form, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study.\n\nA medical history, which involves questions about your health history, any medications you are taking or plan to take, any allergies and the treatments you received for your CM.\n\nA physical exam, during which you will be asked about any problems that you might be having.
