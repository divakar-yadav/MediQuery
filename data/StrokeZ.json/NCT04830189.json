Scoring is based on direct observation of performance. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline Fugl Meyer test score at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Barthel Index","description":"Daily life activities were assessed with Barthel Index.
