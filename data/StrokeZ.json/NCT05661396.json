Serious games are a promising solution in the rehabilitation of cognitive impairments, and they may be useful in the rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect. The investigators developed a rehabilitation program for visual exploration training with a serious game and investigated its efficiency.\n\nSix patients with unilateral spatial neglect after a right hemispheric stroke were recruited. Three patients assigned to the experimental group received both serious game training and conventional rehabilitation, and three assigned to the control group received only conventional rehabilitation. The investigators compared the two groups after rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Unilateral Spatial Neglect"],"keywords":["serious game","stroke","unilateral spatial neglect","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Serious game rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Serious game rehabilitation","description":"Three patients received therapeutic serious game rehabilitation in addition to conventional rehabilitation.
