Patient's characteristics and procedural data were collected. Analyses were performed to compare mechanical thrombectomy speed, efficacy, complications, and clinical outcomes between patients with and without pre-intervention gadolinium-enhanced extracranial MRA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Mechanical thrombectomy","Magnetic resonance angiography","Angiogram","Angiography","Magnetic resonance imaging","Revascularization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":912,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"gadolinium-enhanced extracranial magnetic resonance angiogram","description":"288 of the 912 acute ischemic stroke patients received gadolinium-enhanced extracranial MRA additionally to the standardized stroke MRI imaging protocol."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"time from groin puncture to clot contact","description":"in minute time from onset to recanalization complications \\[embolic or hemorrhagic\\]","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin Score","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke\n\nExclusion Criteria:","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based screening for acute neurovascular evaluation and who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) at one comprehensive stroke center.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
