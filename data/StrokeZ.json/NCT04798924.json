We will measure structural and mechanistic aspects of progressive degeneration along the early visual pathways, correlating them with changes in visual performance, and in responsiveness to visual restoration training. This project will advance both scientific knowledge, as well as technical capability and clinical practices for restoring vision and quality of life for people suffering from cortical blindness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Quadrantanopia","Vision Loss Partial","Visual Field Defect, Peripheral","Peripheral Visual Field Defect of Both Eyes","Peripheral Visual Field Defect","Hemianopsia","Hemianopia","Homonymous Hemianopia","Homonymous Hemianopsia","Visual Fields Hemianopsia","Occipital Lobe Infarct","Quadrantanopsia","Stroke Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Occipital stroke","vision loss","Homonymous quadrantanopia","Homonymous quadrantanopsia","stroke","Vision loss after stroke","Vision recovery","Vision restoration","Partial vision loss"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Training in the blind field","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Training in the blind field using specialized software","interventionNames":["Device: Subacute Training in the blind field","Device: Chronic Training in the blind field"]},{"label":"Training in the intact field","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Training in the intact field using specialized software","interventionNames":["Device: Subacute Training in the intact field","Device: Chronic Training in the blind field"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Subacute Training in the intact field","description":"A computer software and chin-rest necessary to perform visual training will be loaned to each subject to be used at home.
