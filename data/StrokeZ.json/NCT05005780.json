Stroke patients will either receive ipsilesional 100 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) triplet burst protocol synchronized to the ongoing µ-alpha oscillation or contralesional 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocol. Motor recovery is assessed directly after as well as three months after completion of the therapy.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is one of the leading cause for long-term disability worldwide. The standard approach to treat deficits after stroke is a rehabilitation therapy, that follows the stroke event directly. This therapy mainly includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet, despite intensive rehabilitation efforts, more than half of all stroke patients remain greatly disabled.\n\nRepetitive TMS is capable of inducing plasticity-like effects in the brain, that are expected to enhance adaptive plasticity processes leading to functional regain after stroke. In the motor cortex, brain oscillation-synchronized TMS, i.e. TMS triggered dependent on the phase of instantaneous µ-alpha oscillations as detected by real-time EEG (electroencephalography) analysis, has been shown to consistently increase motor cortical excitability and plasticity effects. We therefore hypothesis that a greater therapeutic potential of TMS to modulate dysfunctional brain networks can be exploited by personalizing TMS therapy to individual brain states (i.e. brain oscillations).\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an ipsilesional 100 Hz TMS triplet burst protocol synchronized to the ongoing µ-alpha oscillation compared to the current TMS standard therapy of contralesional 1 Hz rTMS in chronic stroke patients. Both groups will undergo stimulation therapy three times a week, with each session directly followed by physiotherapy. Motor recovery will be assessed directly after as well as three months after completion of the therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"µ-alpha oscillation coupled ipsilesional 100 Hz triplet bursts","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"µ-rhythm (The µ rhythm frequency band is defined by activity falling between 8 and 13 Hz and recorded by scalp electrodes over the sensorimotor cortex during waking neural activity) negative peak triggered TMS of ipsilesional primary motor cortex, consisting of 400 triple pulses at 100 Hz, delivered at a mean inter-triple pulse interval of 3.0 s.
