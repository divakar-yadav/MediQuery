Besides, the observation group additionally underwent the stellate ganglion block (SGB). At admission and after 20-day treatment, Kubota water swallowing test, video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), and Rosenbek penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) were used to assess swallowing function.","detailedDescription":"Dysphagia is a frequent and potentially serious complication of stroke. However, there is no effective measure for the treatment of pharyngeal dysphagia in stroke patients. This study aims to explore the efficacy of stellate ganglion block in post-stroke pharyngeal dysphagic patients who received comprehensive rehabilitation. This was a multicenter randomized controlled study. 66 post-stroke patients with pharyngeal dysphagia were randomly allocated to the observation group (n=33) or the control group (n=33). Both groups were provided with comprehensive rehabilitation including routine rehabilitation and swallowing function training.

Under the guidance of the examiner, the patient first swallowed 5ml of iohexol solution (50ml:17.5g in iodine terms). If the patient exhibited aspiration, the test would stop. If not, the patient was instructed to swallow 10ml of iohexol solution mixed with breadcrumbs, and the patient's swallowing condition was observed with immediate measures ready to take for safety. Specially, the esophageal phase was not included in the study, because it was commonly regarded as an independent phase. The swallowing were divided into 3 phases in this assessment: Oral phase, Pharyngeal phase, and Aspiration, with maximum 3,3,4 points were given to each phase. The total score was calculated as the final result. The final score was positively correlated with the swallowing function.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 20"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Kubota water swallowing test","description":"During the test, patients were required to drink 30 ml of warm water.

Besides, we evaluated the efficacy as: 1) Recovery: The patient's symptoms of dysphagia disappear with grade 1 in the test. 2) Improvement: The patient shows improvement in dysphagia with the water the grade of the test improved. 3) Invalid: The patient's dysphagia deteriorates or did not improve, with the grade of the test not improved.
