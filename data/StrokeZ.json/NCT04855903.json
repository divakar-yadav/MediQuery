We will assess patients' performances in achieving ADLs by the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) throughout the follow-up (3 months), based on the goals set at the beginning of management with each patient.","detailedDescription":"Many post-stroke patients, especially those with frontal lobe lesions, have chronic impairments in mental flexibility, leading to difficulties in decision-making, action planning, or behavioural perseverance. Techniques for remediation of these dysexecutive disorders are often performed in a hospital or in a liberal office. The possible progress resulting from this rehabilitation is rarely transposed into the patient daily life performances, executed in a richer and less controlled environment than the usual place of re-educational. Here, we wish to assess the effective benefits (i.e. in carrying out the activities of daily living) of a computerized rehabilitation program addressing executive functions and based on virtual reality, simulating ADLs. We use in this study a multiple baseline single case experimental design (AB design with a follow-up beyond), including for each patient: pretreatment (phase A), treatment (phase B), and follow-up phase.\n\nPretreatment includes a routine sensitivomotor neurological rehabilitation program that doesn't specifically target executive functions in daily living activities (3 to 5 weeks depending on randomization). Treatment consists in a 4 weeks virtual reality cognitive training program, including four 45-minute sessions per week with an occupational therapist for cognitive rehabilitation in a virtual environment with the COVIRTUA Cognition software. The follow-up phase (5 to 3 weeks depending on randomization) includes no support for executive functions, either in a rehabilitation centre or in a liberal office."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["N-of-1 trials","cognitive rehabilitation","computerized rehabilitation","virtual reality","executive functions","occupational therapy","post-stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Multiple Baseline case experimental design (N-of-1 trial)","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1 (early phase B)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 phases of cognitive training: Phase A : rehabilitation program in standard ergotherapy during 3 weeks Phase B : cognitive training using Covirtua Cognition software during 4 weeks\n\nThese 2 phases will be followed by a follow-up phase during 5 weeks","interventionNames":["Device: Covirtua Cognition software"]},{"label":"Arm 2 (mid phase B)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 phases of cognitive training: Phase A : rehabilitation program in standard ergotherapy during 4 weeks Phase B : cognitive training using Covirtua Cognition software during 4 weeks\n\nThese 2 phases will be followed by a follow-up phase during 4 weeks","interventionNames":["Device: Covirtua Cognition software"]},{"label":"Arm 3 (late phase B)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 phases of cognitive training: Phase A : rehabilitation program in standard ergotherapy during 5 weeks Phase B : cognitive training using Covirtua Cognition software during 4 weeks\n\nThese 2 phases will be followed by a follow-up phase during 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Device: Covirtua Cognition software"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Covirtua Cognition software","description":"Cognitive training with Covirtua Cognition software","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1 (early phase B)","Arm 2 (mid phase B)","Arm 3 (late phase B)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evolution of performance at GAS (Goal Attainment Scaling)","description":"Performance in carrying out activities of daily living will be evaluated in an ecological situation using Kiresuk and Sherman's 'Goal Attainment Scaling' (GAS) method.
