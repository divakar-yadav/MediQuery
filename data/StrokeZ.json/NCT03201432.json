About 1/4 of the ischemic stroke occurred in the vertebral basilar artery system, especially when in the presence of extracranial proximal vertebral artery stenosis. Vertebral artery stenting is a minimally invasive method for the reconstruction of vertebral artery stenosis and the early clinical studies showed that it was feasible, safe and effective, but the high rate of restenosis has become a bottleneck restricting its development. Previous systematic review had suggested that the drug eluting stent might reduce the incidence of restenosis of vertebral artery. However, prospective randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of bare metal stents and drug eluting stents on the prevention of restenosis remains absent.","detailedDescription":"60 patients were randomly assigned into DES and BES group to compare the safety and efficacy in the treatment of symptomatic extracranial vertebral artery stenosis with drug eluting stents (YINYI) and bare metal stents (Express SD), especially the stent restenosis rate after 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Vertebral Artery Stenosis"],"keywords":["Vertebral Artery Stenosis","Ischemic Stroke","Stent"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"No Masking"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bare metal stent (BES) group","type":"OTHER","description":"Percutaneous vertebral artery stenting using bare metal stents (Boston Scientific：Express SD) in patients randomized to BES group","interventionNames":["Device: Bare metal stent (BES)"]},{"label":"Drug eluting stent (DES) group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Percutaneous vertebral artery stenting using drug eluting stents (Liaoning Biomedical Materials R\\&D Center Co., Ltd. ：YINYI) in patients randomized to DES group","interventionNames":["Device: Drug eluting stent (DES)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Drug eluting stent (DES)","description":"Polymer-free paclitaxel eluting stents","armGroupLabels":["Drug eluting stent (DES) group"],"otherNames":["YINYI (Liaoning Biomedical Materials R&D Center Co., Ltd.)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Bare metal stent (BES)","description":"Bare metal stent","armGroupLabels":["Bare metal stent (BES) group"],"otherNames":["Express SD (Bosten Scientific)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stent restenosis rate 6 months after stenting","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stent restenosis rate 3 months after stenting","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Stent restenosis rate 12 months after stenting","description":"measured by ultrasound","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"The incidence of cardiovascular events (stroke, TIA, Miocardial infarction and death) 6 months after stenting","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Symptomatic posterior circulation ischemia（Vertebral basilar artery system TIA or non-disabling ischemic stroke）result from the stenosis in the extracranial proximal vertebral artery stenosis.\n* Atherosclerotic extracranial proximal vertebral artery stenosis demonstrated by angiography(any of the following): 1) bilateral vertebral artery stenosis ≥70%, or vertebral artery stenosis ≥70% concomitant occlusion of contralateral vertebral artery;
