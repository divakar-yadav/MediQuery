Empirical evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce neuroplastic changes that modulate cognitive function. However, it is unclear whether hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings can facilitate cortical activity and physiological outcome measures and further influence on the cognitive function after stroke. We aim to investigate the effects of two hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors with cognitive decline. This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A target sample size of 75 participants will be recruited. Stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline will be stratified by Mini-Mental State Examination scores and then randomized 1:1:1 to sequential exercise-cognitive training, dual-task exercise-cognitive training or control groups. All groups will undergo trainings 60 min/day, 3 days/week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the resting-state functional connectivity and neural activation in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes include physiological biomarkers, cognitive functions, physical function, daily functions and quality of life.\n\nThis study may differentiate the effects of two hybridized trainings on cognitive function and health-related conditions and detect appropriate neurological and physiological indices to predict training effects. This study capitalizes on the groundwork for non-pharmacological intervention of cognitive decline after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients With Cognitive Decline"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sequential training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise training for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes of cognitive-based intervention","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Sequential training"]},{"label":"Dual training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exercise training simultaneously combined cognitive-based intervention for 60 minutes","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Dual training"]},{"label":"Control training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"non-aerobic exercise (e.g., stretch, range of motion exercise...) and unstructured cognitive rehabilitation programs (e.g., reading newspapers, playing board games...) for 60 minutes","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Control training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Sequential training","description":"The participant will cycle on a stationary bike for 30 minutes, which includes a 3-min warm-up phase followed by the aerobic training components (25 minutes), then a 2-min cool-down phase.
