The research team are therefore developing algorithms for four different locations.\n\nThe purpose of the research is for the development of the algorithms and check whether they accurately recognise different positions and movements in people whose movement is affected by a stroke, and by being in a hospital environment (e.g. using a profiling bed).\n\nThe research team plan to recruit between 34 and 50 participants who are admitted hospital due to having a stroke. After providing informed consent, participants will be asked to complete a one-off assessment with a member of the research team and a ward physiotherapist. Participants will be asked to wear the four sensors, and move through a series of postures, walk for up to six minutes, and stand as many times as they feel able in one minute."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention","description":"This is not an interventional study.
