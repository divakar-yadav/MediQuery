Each group will receive the real rTMS or sham rTMS, respectively, over the primary motor cortex of the dominant hand. Individual subject will receive ten sessions of rTMS. Each rTMS session is low frequency (1Hz), total 1800 stimulations.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of rTMS 『TMS』 for upper extremity motor function recovery in patients with ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Neuronal plasticity","Transcranial magnetic stimulation","Stroke","Upper extremity","Function","Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":77,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"true coil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Use the true coil / Low frequency rTMS / Intensity: 100% of resting motor threshold;
