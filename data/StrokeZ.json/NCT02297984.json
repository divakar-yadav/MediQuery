Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α is neuroprotective in several models of experimental brain injury and is increased in brain after acute cerebral infarction in humans and experimental animals.The investigators sought to examine the changes in serum neuroglobin and HIF-1α concentrations in patients with acute ischemic stroke during the initial 96-h period after stroke and assessed the relation between them and the relation of them to prognosis of such patients with acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Neuroglobin","HIF-α","Acute ischemic stroke","Prognosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acute ischemic stroke","description":"Patients who suffered from acute ischemic stroke within 12 hours for the first time before entry into the study."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale scores","description":"0 = No symptoms; 1 = No significant disability.
