However, there is no previous study for an association between cerebral artery WSS and clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke in lenticulostriate artery.\n\nThe researchers aimed to investigate whether the signal intensity gradient (SIG) from Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF MRA) in cerebral arteries, as a surrogate measure of arterial WSS, is associated with clinical outcome, which was determined with modified Rankin Scale (mRS).\n\nThe patients (n=294) with the lenticulostriate artery infarction were collected in 3 hospitals with variable locations and sizes (Gunsan, Jeonju, and Seoul). For a clinical outcome, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were checked serially from the date of admission. The mRS 2 or less at the 7th day or discharge was defined as a favorable outcome. The arterial SIGs were measured concurrently in both internal carotid, anterior/middle/posterior cerebral, vertebral arteries, and basilar artery from TOF MRA on initial diagnosis. The independent association between the clinical outcome and cerebral arterial SIG was analyzed adjusting for all the possible potential confounders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Cerebral artery","Lenticulostriate artery infarction","Signal intensity gradient","Signal intensity gradient, Wall shear stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":294,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Grouped as the favorable outcome","description":"\\<3 mRS of discharge or 7th day in the patients with the lenticulostriate artery infarction","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Signal intensity gradient"]},{"label":"Grouped as the unfavorable outcome","description":"≥3 mRS of discharge or 7th day in the patients with the lenticulostriate artery infarction","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Signal intensity gradient"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Signal intensity gradient","description":"In time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, The signal intensities at the iso-point (Φa; signal intensity at position A \\[Xa\\] along the arterial contour line) and at the inner point (Φb; signal intensity at position B \\[Xb\\]) were calculated by using a trilinear interpolation algorithm based on the positions and signal intensities in the eight neighboring voxels.
