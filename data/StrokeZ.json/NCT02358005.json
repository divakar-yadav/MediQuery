However, it was not determined which dose of ESWT is optimal as a adjuvant therapy after BTX-A injection on the upper limb in patients with stroke. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal dose of ESWT after botulinum toxin type A injection for post-stroke spasticity"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-Stroke Elbow Spasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"60mJ ESWT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ESWT (0.04 mJ/mm2, 1500 shock + sham stimulation 2500) / total dose per treatment : 60mJ","interventionNames":["Procedure: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy 60mj"]},{"label":"120mJ ESWT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ESWT (0.04 mJ/mm2, 4000 shock) / total dose per treatment : 160mJ","interventionNames":["Procedure: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy 120mj"]},{"label":"sham ESWT stimulation","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"ESWT (0 mJ/mm2, sham stimulation 4000) / total dose per treatment : 0mJ","interventionNames":["Procedure: non extracorporeal shock wave therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy 60mj","armGroupLabels":["60mJ ESWT"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy 120mj","armGroupLabels":["120mJ ESWT"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"non extracorporeal shock wave therapy","armGroupLabels":["sham ESWT stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Range of Motion (ROM) of elbow flexor","timeFrame":"5 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or female\n* Age ≥20 years\n* inpatients\n* Elbow flexor spasticity in patients, confirmed to be mainly due to biceps brachii\n* Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) ≥2,\n* At least a 3-month period from stroke,\n* Written informed consent has been obtained\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Fixed contractures and/or deformities at the elbow,\n* Previous fractures of the paretic upper limb,\n* Peripheral nervous system disorders/myopathies,\n* Previous BTX-A treatment and/or ESWT,\n* Structural alterations in the soft tissue (e.g., fibrosis),\n* Known allergy or sensitivity to the study medication or its components\n* Presence of an unstable medical condition or uncontrolled systemic disease\n* Any medical condition that may put the patient at increased risk with exposure to botulinum toxin therapy.
