There is a serious lack of health literacy regarding survival after stroke. We hypothesize that our set of 5 minute videos that teach important skills to stroke survivors and their caregivers , that can be replayed in cell phones for extended learning, will increase their adherence to Medications after stroke and improve the control of blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and glucose in the participants getting cell phone based educational videos.","detailedDescription":"In 80% of patients with stroke, further events may be prevented by altering lifestyle behavioral risk, and increasing adherence to medications to control hypertension, diabetes, lipids. Yet, there exists a huge science to implementation gap to adopt these widely recognized beneficial medicines and lifestyle changes. Those most in need remain unable to actualize the benefits of science, due to lack of knowledge, perceived complexity, literacy challenges, limited time by poorly communicating doctors in crowded clinics and essentially, failure by regional scientists to translate Western science in creative resonant ways that enable wider uptake.\n\nIn this randomized double blind translational implementation study, we will study the effectiveness of the implementation tactic of delivering enabling stroke education and risk reduction to literacy and numeracy challenged Pakistani stroke survivors and their caregivers, via short films teaching stroke recognition, healthy habits, medication adherence and self-care. These 5 minute films , using a 'show me not tell me ' approach, will be replayed in tablets, and shown to all stroke patients in the intervention arm. The primary objective of this study is to answer the research question - Does video based education given to stroke patients (with mild to moderate disability) and their caregivers before discharge, and during follow up, improve adherence to therapy and control of three major risk factors (Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia) at twelve months post index stroke?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":310,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard Care, Organized Discharge","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Stroke patients are given instructions before discharge regarding diet, need for rehabilitation, possible complications, medication use and information booklets are also handed out.
