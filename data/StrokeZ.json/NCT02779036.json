Reintegration of community life by optimizing walking function is a major goal of stroke rehabilitation. Because not widely available inpatient rehabilitation, discharged with incomplete recovery, limited numbers of technically trained physical therapists, financial saving, and transportation difficulty, home-based stroke rehabilitation setting has been interested in many developing countries.\n\nTask- oriented exercise is well known and accepted approach to optimize walking function with underlying principles of motor control and motor learning theories. This approach has been used in the clinical setting with close supervision, but identification of appropriate protocol in the community environment is on progress. To date, no proper home exercise program based on task-oriental principle with minimal supervision for improving walking competency after stroke has been proposed in stroke rehabilitation.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a structured, progressive, task- oriented home exercise program on walking competency in individual post stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","task-oriented home exercise","walking competency","Usual Physiotherapy care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":63,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Task-oriented Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Structured, progressive, task-oriented, home exercise program","interventionNames":["Procedure: Task-oriented home exercise"]},{"label":"Usual Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual Physiotherapy Care","interventionNames":["Procedure: Usual Physiotherapy Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Task-oriented home exercise","description":"Structured, walking related task-oriented home exercise program with three progressive steps, at moderate to high intensity, 60 minutes per session, three sessions per week for total 8 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Task-oriented Exercise"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Usual Physiotherapy Care","description":"Deficits-oriented free active and resisted lower extremity exercises with bicycling and overground walking , 60 minutes per session, three sessions per week for total 8 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Usual Care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6 Minutes Walk Test","description":"Patients will be measured their walking distance by a blind assessor on five occasions:at baseline,1,2,5 and 8 weeks after baseline testing.","timeFrame":"up to 8 weeks"},{"measure":"10 Meter Walk Test","description":"Patients will be measured their walking speed by a blind assessor on five occasions:at baseline,1,2,5 and 8 weeks after baseline testing.","timeFrame":"up to 8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"Patients will be measured their walking balance by a blind assessor on five occasions:at baseline,1,2,5 and 8 weeks after baseline testing.","timeFrame":"up to 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Dynamic Gait Index","description":"Patients will be measured their walking adaptability by a blind assessor on two occasions:at baseline and 8 weeks after baseline testing.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale (Participation)","description":"Patients will be measured their community participation by a blind assessor on two occasions:at baseline and 8 weeks after baseline testing.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
