On the hypothesis that acupuncture intervention could produce the same therapeutic effects as antidepressants. The investigators also hypothesized that acupuncture would be associated with minimal side effects.","detailedDescription":"Aim: To observe the curative effect of acupuncture in the treatment of Ischemic Post-Stroke Depression． Design: A multicentre,open-label randomized controlled trial will be performed in Tianjin and Beijing . Two hundred and eight participants with Ischemic Post-Stroke Depression patients were randomly divided into two groups which were both given basic treatment of stroke. The acupuncture group was given Tiaoshenkaiqiao acupuncture therapy and placebo，while the control group was treated with fluoxetine tablets and sham acupoint acupuncture treatment. Evaluated the clinical efficacy of the two groups with Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD), Barthel Index (BI),Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale,(TESS ),Clinical Global Impression Scale(CGI) respectively before treatment, the second weekend of treatment ,the fourth weekend of treatment, the eighth weekend of treatment, the twelfth weekend of treatment. And observed the adverse reaction of the two groups.\n\nEach participants will receive 36 sessions of acupuncture in 12 weeks, with a duration of 30 minutes in a session.
