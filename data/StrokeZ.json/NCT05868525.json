this clinical trial is to compare difference between Aspirin 81 mg and Aspirin 325 mg in preventing strokes in patients with head and neck vessels injury.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* If Aspirin 81 mg efficacy in prevention of stroke in patients with head and neck vessels injury is not lower than and Aspirin 325 mg.\n* If rate of hemorrhagic complications in patients with head and neck vessels injury taking Aspirin 81 mg is not higher than patients that take Aspirin 325 mg."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury"],"keywords":["Blunt
