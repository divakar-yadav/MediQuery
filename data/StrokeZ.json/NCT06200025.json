However, non-immersive or semi-immersive rehabilitation methods have often been adopted in the studies. Considering the importance of the visual given to the patient for naming, it can be thought that full immersive therapy may be more effective. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cue-based aphasia naming therapy in a fully immersive virtual reality environment on aphasia severity and aphasia-related quality of life and to compare it with standard cue treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"two groups with a conventional control group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":102,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"visual and auditory cue-based aphasia rehabilitation program in full immersive virtual reality","interventionNames":["Other: Cue-based speech therapy in virtual reality"]},{"label":"Conventional Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"visual and auditory cue-based aphasia rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Other: Cue-based speech therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cue-based speech therapy in virtual reality","description":"Treatment applied with virtual reality headsets to provide 3d visual and auditory cues to individuals in a virtual environment.
